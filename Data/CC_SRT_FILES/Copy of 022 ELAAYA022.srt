1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,060
- ... the fact that he couldn't do it
because he didn't have enough money to do

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,475
it. What would you do in that situation?
Would you try to get money?

3
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,104
- Isn't this kind of different because
we're all girls?

4
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:24,644
- Yeah, but...

5
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:29,881
- If it was a boy, and he was the one who
didn't have money...

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,300
- Do you feel like the chapters that we
read, do you feel like you could tell what

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,460
Pip was going to be doing?

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:52,150
- Kind of. You could tell that he was
becoming more stuck-up; wants to change himself

9
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,106
and not be around the poor people.

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,200
- Are you doing the discussion director?
Did you do any questions in regards to

11
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,300
his-- did you have any direct questions
with regards to the text?

12
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,460
- Yeah. One of them was like how did Pip
change from the beginning of the book to

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,090
where he's at now, like his character and
basically how he acted.

14
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,280
- What was the question I missed, Brianna,
where you said about the girls? I didn't

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,590
hear the question. I just heard your
response.

16
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,565
- His was, in Chapter 29, when he is
becoming part of her marriage, he was just

17
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:37,540
like, how would you feel or whatever. None
of us really had an answer because the

18
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:45,845
situation is different, like it's
different for the guys... She's the one

19
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,988
who's like the rich girl.

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,847
- Who's the recording one?

21
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:16,168
- So, on page 128, paragraph two, that's
where Herbert tells Miss Havisham's story.

22
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:20,686
That's important because it kind of
explains why she is the way that she is.

23
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:27,037
He explains that you meet Miss Pocket, and
then she's kind of like- he kind of

24
00:02:27,037 --> 00:02:30,479
explains why she's kind of crazy.

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,180
- All right. Chapter 8 was interesting
because he was home from war and in the

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,122
camp. He started to treat people. He
treated them like they were all heroes.

27
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,660
- And he shared the cigarettes with him
one time.

28
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,419
- He shared the cigarettes with them and
was even

29
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:57,111
[Inaudible].

30
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:09,959
- When he was amongst the Russians, he
didn't care. They were struggling to

31
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,154
survive. He felt sorry for them, which as
a connector, I've connected it to- I

32
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,189
don't know if you guys have seen "Tears of
the Sun."

33
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:17,768
- I have.

34
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:23,588
- And "Avatar." In "Tears of the Sun," he
wanted to go and try to rescue people, but

35
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:24,917
he got stuck behind enemy lines
[Inaudible],

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,585
like they're struggling people too trying
to gain their freedom. And then same thing

37
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:39,200
in "Avatar." Paul kind of reminded me of
how he was behind and he was with the

38
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,252
Russians, but he thought that they weren't
as bad as he- the military was the only

39
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:51,347
bad part about them. Civilians, he felt
sorry for them, that they had to go

40
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:54,703
through all this. They were being killed.
Their people were being killed. And they

41
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:57,228
were actually just regular people trying
to make it.

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,742
Everybody was dying because they used all
this stuff in the military and they

43
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:07,363
weren't caring about the civilians.

44
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:10,300
[cross talk]

45
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,560
- The prisoners?
- They were [Inaudible].

46
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:28,475
- They had to trade whatever they had to
get like a couple supplies to the

47
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:28,933
refugees.

48
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:32,718
- He started to wonder like why are people
higher up, people he'd never met forcing

49
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:33,605
them
[Inaudible].

50
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:36,615
- Yeah.

51
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:39,900
[cross talk]

52
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:01,250
- So, then this whole section made me
think about that. So, I thought that could

53
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,311
be like the controversial part to talk
about. This whole section...

54
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,710
- Which whole section?

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,330
- The one you were just talking about.

56
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:15,943
- They're talking about magic.

57
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:19,224
- Yeah. They're talking about the magic
and being invisible and then he

58
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,304
[Inaudible]
and scares them away.

59
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:28,672
- It really showed a struggle between
Antonio internally with religions.

60
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:30,170
- Yeah.

61
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,654
- In one he had keys and then in the other
one it was totally crazy.

62
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:36,234
- Yeah.

63
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:44,309
- That's my next section, is that dream. I
think it's page 119. That whole dream is

64
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:50,772
really important because it's like, it
kind of highlights what I just said about

65
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:56,448
how he might be the next
[Inaudible] person or whatever.

66
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:00,980
He goes to this dream and it's kind of the
same thing he's been facing through the

67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,930
whole book- his mom's side versus his
dad's side. And Ultima kind of

68
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,536
comes out and is like, "Well, you are
both. You have to find a happy medium."

69
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:21,231
It's all within the world of his dreams.
And then page 139...

70
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:28,520
- One part that I thought was really,
really important was his brother at the

71
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,910
brothel.

72
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,052
- These two chapters, I think they're kind
of jam-packed. I just kind of picked stuff

73
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:49,756
that would be good to talk about. And then
page 139, paragraph three, they're talking

74
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:59,746
about how the group can be buried in the
casket of time. I just felt that was

75
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:04,927
informative and something that we should
look at. Just pretty much the whole

76
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:05,430
funeral.

77
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,264
- The funeral was good styling.

78
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:11,827
- Like, I don't know, these
four chapters...

79
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:15,270
- There was no part where you didn't
[Inaudible].

80
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,700
- It's like, read these four chapters.

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,197
- Exactly.

82
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:32,557
- After I read the chapter, I wrote some
questions down. The first one is what did

83
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:37,343
the contrast between the golden carp and
the black bass- how the golden carp made

84
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:55,165
the black bass jump. And his missing of
the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for

85
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:56,489
Abel...

86
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,824
- The golden carp story was just very
interesting.

87
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:15,532
- The whole controversy is that he's
Catholic, but part of him really wants to

88
00:08:15,532 --> 00:08:16,318
believe in this whole...

89
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:23,363
- It's not like he wasn't interested in
it, but he still didn't believe. But then

90
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:27,020
he still respected the story itself and
the respect of the carp.

91
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:40,499
- It made me feel like the golden carp
would bring it up. Could Antonio...

92
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,757
[cross talk]

93
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,220
- It made me feel that Antonio's struggle
between his mother's beliefs and his

94
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,936
father's, how his father was like, on the
corpse-strewn shore.

95
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:27,146
- I remember there was something like when
you're in the ocean, it's the same

96
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,083
water-

97
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:32,218
- It's like Ultima came in.

98
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:39,142
- She was like, "You don't pick one.
You're both. That's it."

99
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:42,210
- You can't just choose one path.

100
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,067
- You should be a priest cowboy.

101
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:53,429
- I think the way it was portrayed was
like because of the way he was brought up,

102
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:56,479
it was kind of showing the negative.

103
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,289
[cross talk]

104
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,430
- She's brought up. She's not there, but
she's brought up too much.

105
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:34,460
- I feel like she's a goal though, to be
like be some kind of spirit type thing.

106
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,070
- He hopes that she's like someone who's
not fake.

107
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,680
- So, I guess he's trying to like make
things work with everyone else and see,

108
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,308
like, what his relationship with other
people and to finally be able to call a

109
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:53,523
[Inaudible].

110
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,800
- I feel like he compares all of his
relationships to her. He has that

111
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,699
standard.

112
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:03,715
- Didn't he point out like all the flaws
of her?

113
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,864
[cross talk]

114
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:53,510
- That was just creepy. I was just like,
"Poor guy," to have all of these weird,

115
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,233
awkward dreams.

116
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,968
- I'm going to say foreshadowing. I'm
sticking by that and saying Ultima's going

117
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:08,459
to die and he's going to be the new...
I'm sticking by that, and that's

118
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,444
foreshadowing.

119
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:11,571
- Look at you go.

120
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:14,710
- All of those things are foreshadowing or
are they just predicting something that

121
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,600
happened in the past?

122
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,957
- Most of them. Well, I think the one
where, remember where he went into a

123
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:26,765
brothel in the one dream? Right. Exactly.
So, I think that most of the dreams are

124
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:27,690
foreshadowing.

125
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:33,078
- They're not showing directly what
happens, but hints.

126
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,292
- Basically I'm a beast.

127
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:40,586
- We don't even have to read the rest of
the book because I just gave it to you.

128
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,523
- Because we know what's happening.

129
00:12:41,523 --> 00:12:48,512
- I said also, in chapter 14, the bad
dream, what do you make of it? Is he

130
00:12:48,512 --> 00:12:55,832
seeing the sinners as deserters that all
witches are being spun out and that he

131
00:12:55,832 --> 00:13:00,609
needs to step forward? Or does the golden
carp have like stronger power? What do you

132
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:03,179
think it symbolizes?

133
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:13,022
- I think there are good witches and there
are bad witches. The bad witches are the

134
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:14,886
ones that should be, like...

135
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:17,945
[cross talk]

136
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,472
- That's Antonio's issue as well. I think
he's kind of figured out that there's

137
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:35,310
something different about Ultima. I think
he's kind of figured out that- he's kind

138
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,920
of just like, "Oh, they're evil and she's
good. If she's a witch, then she's evil."

139
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,280
So, it's kind of this contrast of can a
witch be good? It's kind of like the

140
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,250
question of what he wants to believe
versus...

141
00:13:50,103 --> 00:13:55,380
- It kind of relates to the Civil War and
the Africans and their personal stuff. It

142
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,900
kind of relates to that.

143
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,134
The white people, they didn't want to
believe that they're intelligent and

144
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:06,534
they're friends. He doesn't want to
believe that a witch can be good because

145
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,130
he's been told otherwise.

146
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,095
- And he's a Catholic and witches are
evil.

147
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:22,004
- I think that the golden carp symbolizes
perhaps the rebirth.

148
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,696
- I think the two most important themes,
symbol figures are the owl and the carp.

149
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,412
[cross talk]
