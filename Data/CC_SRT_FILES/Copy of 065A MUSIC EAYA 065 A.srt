00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,340
- [Teacher] Now, I'm going to get to what
we are beginning to learn today. I'm going

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,480
to go ahead and put my tie up here...

4
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:38,460
Now, is there anyone who can tell me what
this is? What is that, Daniel?

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,810
- [Daniel] A dotted eighth note.

6
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,420
- This is a dotted eighth note. Who can
tell me what this note is? Sedekia?

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,400
- [Sedekia] One sixteenth note.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,330
- It is a sixteenth note, so we have a
dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note.

9
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,990
Now remember our rule that we just went
over this morning about the dot. With that

10
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:08,867
in mind, can somebody tell me what the
value of that note is? Cole?

11
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:11,203
- [Cole] It would last for like three beats.
- [Instructor] Three beats...

12
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:21,258
- [Cole] And then you would have a sixteenth note.

13
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,080
Okay, I think you're on the right track, it would last

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,718
for three of something, but not three beats, Landon?

15
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:27,867
- [Landon] Three fourths of a beat?

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,920
- It would be three fourths of a beat, so
let's think about this, remember, an

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,620
eighth note in 4/4 time gets half of a
beat. Everybody, what's half of a half?

18
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,590
- [student] One fourth.

19
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,540
- One fourth, so the dot is worth one
fourth of a beat, that means that this

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,780
dotted eighth note is three fourths of a
beat. Well that sounds a little bit

21
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,540
complicated, but all you need to do is
think about this and apply it down here.

22
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,040
So who can tell me what I would write for
counts under this dotted eighth note?

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,830
Raise your hand. Lydon?

24
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,090
- [Lydon] Would it be one, e &?

25
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,770
- One e &, because that's the same as
having three of both, and Jaylin what

26
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,110
would go here?

27
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,640
- [Jaylin] a e.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,200
- Okay, so this is just another way of
writing this. Let's do a measure of

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,560
counting that. Ready? And, go, and...

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,270
- [together with clapping] One e and a
two, and one e and a two, and one e and a

31
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,330
two, and one e and a two, and...

32
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,480
- Now, I want all my first row to do that
four times, okay? And, go, and...

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,861
- [students] One e and a two, and one e
and a two, and one e and a two, and one e

34
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,333
and a two, and

35
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,285
- Second row, ready, and, go, and...

36
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:01,000
- [students] One e and a two, and one e
and a two.
