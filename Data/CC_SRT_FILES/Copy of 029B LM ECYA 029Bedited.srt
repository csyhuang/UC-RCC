1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:01,490
- What I'm going to do is

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,929
we are going to use these projects

3
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:04,810
to help students at our school.

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,852
Mrs. Ess's class is not the only class

5
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:10,894
that has had problems with students

6
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:12,171
accidentally plagiarizing.

7
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:14,167
And that was the original reason that you

8
00:00:14,167 --> 00:00:16,396
guys came here today: because somebody in

9
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:19,252
another class had plagiarized
something accidentally

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,063
in Mrs. Ess's class.

11
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,577
Your projects today are going to be used

12
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:26,224
in other classrooms.

13
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:27,965
So we're going to have a contest.

14
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,939
We're going to pick
the 5 best Powerpoints,

15
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,421
and we're going to send
them out to other classrooms

16
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:38,576
to help students learn why
they shouldn't plagiarize.

17
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:41,432
Now some of you are already
experts at Powerpoint.

18
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:43,220
We're not learning how to
do Powerpoint right now.

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,728
A lot of you already know how to summarize

20
00:00:45,728 --> 00:00:49,628
because you learned to
summarize in Mrs. Ess's class.

21
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:51,741
So you have that experience.

22
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:54,179
There was a disconnect where you didn't

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,526
put the two together.

24
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:58,196
So what we're doing right
now is we're saying,

25
00:00:58,196 --> 00:00:59,752
okay, I know how to summarize;

26
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:02,933
now I know how to avoid plagiarism.

27
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:06,741
So let's start working right now.

28
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,296
You have your rubric.

29
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:09,736
Look at your rubric.

30
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,942
If you have a question, raise your hand

31
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:13,474
and I'll come and explain it.

32
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,726
And we're going to start
right this very second.

33
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:20,486
So go ahead and get into
Powerpoint, and do your powerpoint.

34
00:01:20,486 --> 00:01:23,412
If you're going to be
doing something different,

35
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:29,611
like making a newspaper, a
brochure, or maybe a podcast

36
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,910
then you're going to
start working on that.

37
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,706
And I am just going to
walk around you guys.

38
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:40,323
Our focus is plagiarism, and
the way we avoid plagiarism

39
00:01:40,323 --> 00:02:00,938
is through focusing on summarizing.

40
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,962
So you can refer back to your notes.

41
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:05,237
Remember you used your Cornell notes

42
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:07,559
the other day when you were here

43
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:13,503
and we went online, and you
took a summarization quiz

44
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:17,822
and tutoring session? I'll
be right there in a second.

45
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:20,052
Yes?

46
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,535
I'm sorry?

47
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:39,402
(inaudible whispering)

48
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:45,121
Okay, David?

49
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,192
Yes, yes absolutely.

50
00:02:48,192 --> 00:03:11,560
(inaudible whispering)

51
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,441
I'm sorry, I'll be back
to you in a moment.

52
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:17,167
Yes?

53
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:19,396
- (inaudible question)

54
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:26,293
- I think that would be a great idea.

55
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,569
We're focusing on
plagiarism and we've learned

56
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,100
about how summarization is
one of the ways to avoid it.

57
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,843
Right?

58
00:03:32,843 --> 00:03:38,939
Okay. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:44,401
Sure. Very good.

60
00:03:44,401 --> 00:04:04,815
Oh, great, you're back up.

61
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:06,773
Okay, tissues are behind the globe.

62
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:12,181
Can you go get one for me?

63
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:22,776
Okay, have you been helped?

64
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,135
You have to know how to spell it.

65
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:26,666
Right over there on the board.

66
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:57,996
(inaudible speaking)

67
00:04:57,996 --> 00:04:59,491
How's it going Cathy?

68
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:10,546
- Pretty much.

69
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,239
- Take off the S.

70
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:15,510
I like that though. It was good.

71
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,689
You need some help Mr. Phillip?

72
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:17,641
- No thank you.

73
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:25,273
- You're fine?

74
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:27,175
What you're doing is looking through here

75
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:32,485
at all the requirements.

76
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:36,780
So when you use your creativity
to put this together,

77
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,679
And I, yes?

78
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,398
- what does this word mean?

79
00:05:43,398 --> 00:05:47,066
- Okay. So, multimedia
basically means that

80
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:50,085
it could be either
Powerpoint or a podcast.

81
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:56,716
So you need all of these
to get the highest grade.

82
00:05:56,716 --> 00:06:01,503
So if you come up with
something additional,

83
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:04,496
you're going to get a higher grade.

84
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:07,019
This part you did here is basically

85
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,128
your method of memorization
which would be number 3.

86
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:13,020
How is it going?

87
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:24,839
- Pretty good.

88
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,326
- Now remember if you're
taking a definition

89
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:33,170
of plagiarism from a website,

90
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,557
then you really need to
say where you got that.

91
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:42,247
There's a way of doing that.

92
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:46,820
You're going to state where you got that,

93
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,026
and when it was, yes?

94
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:52,555
- (inaudible question)

95
00:06:52,555 --> 00:07:09,319
- That's okay. You're going
to use your own words.

96
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:21,811
It's interesting how
different all of these look.

97
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,192
Yes, you can. You definitely can.

98
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:39,000
I also have some books
available. They're hiding.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,569
You could, Eric, use this book too.

100
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:49,535
I've got you marked right here.

101
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,367
Would anyone else like a dictionary?

102
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,681
You can get an online definition too.

103
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:58,702
Okay I've got them marked. You
can find it easily that way.

104
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:01,048
- Can we use our paper to take notes?

105
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,812
- Yes, of course you can.

106
00:08:02,812 --> 00:08:07,226
If that would help you, Cathy.

107
00:08:07,226 --> 00:08:09,425
Have you gotten to Powerpoint yet?

108
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:12,096
No?

109
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:15,207
Do you know how to do that?

110
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:18,922
Oh, good.

111
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:29,884
Okay, David. I'm sorry.

112
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:37,849
I've got it in this book too.

113
00:08:37,849 --> 00:09:06,005
(inaudible mumbling)

114
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:07,932
Is that your second slide
or your first slide?

115
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:09,209
- My first.

116
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:23,257
- Okay.

117
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:25,045
Okay, like I said before,

118
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:28,853
the purpose of doing
this is to try to help

119
00:09:28,853 --> 00:09:31,616
other students in our school.

120
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:34,425
And a lot of you already know ways

121
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,329
of avoiding plagiarism.

122
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:39,046
Maybe you were even aware
that you were plagiarizing.

123
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,391
And we've been focusing on summarizing.

124
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:43,318
Of course, there's
another way you can do it.

125
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,013
Paraphrasing is a little bit harder,

126
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:47,312
but we're focusing on summarizing.

127
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:50,609
And besides summarizing,
another thing that you can do,

128
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,279
with summarizing, is still giving credit

129
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,341
to where it came from.

130
00:09:58,341 --> 00:10:00,593
Yes?

131
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:01,354
Hang on.
