1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
(class chatter)

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:03,224
- [Voiceover] Yes,

3
00:00:03,224 --> 00:00:04,945
I think if it's really, really quiet,

4
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:06,321
and you want to talk about something,

5
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:07,464
then, go ahead.

6
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:09,622
But if a lot of people
obviously want to talk,

7
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,340
probably a good idea to raise our hands.

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,623
Okay, what else?

9
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:15,913
- [Voiceover] Be involved?

10
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,559
- Be involved, yes.

11
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,164
I will be keeping track of

12
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:21,988
who contributes to the discussion.

13
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,967
Because everybody has an opinion,

14
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:27,733
but I need you to express that opinion.

15
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,740
What else?

16
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,940
- [Voiceover] Don't criticize
other peoples' ideas.

17
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,761
- Don't criticize other peoples' ideas.

18
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,260
Okay?

19
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,620
What might you do instead?

20
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,182
(classroom chatter)

21
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:43,201
Suggest something,

22
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,571
give your outlook, give your opinion.

23
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:46,456
Okay.

24
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:47,737
Give your argument.

25
00:00:47,737 --> 00:00:49,768
But don't insult the other person's ideas.

26
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:51,418
This is a safe place

27
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,257
to share ideas, okay?

28
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:56,397
Now we're going to have three jobs.

29
00:00:56,397 --> 00:01:00,445
I'm going to need a task master,
a reader, and a time-keeper.

30
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:01,573
- [Voiceover] Time-keeper!

31
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:02,440
- You want to be the time-keeper?

32
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,840
Alright, you need to
let us know when we've got

33
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,050
about two minutes left of the class.

34
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,319
- [Girl in Necklace] I
want to be the task master.

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,839
- [Teacher] Okay, so what
does the task master do?

36
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:08,877
- [Girl Wearing Necklace] They make sure

37
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,265
that everybody's on task.

38
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:11,285
- [Teacher] Yeah, what else?

39
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:12,770
What might that look like?

40
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,613
- [Girl in Gray Hoodie] Subjects get off,

41
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,042
or out of control.
- [Teacher] So, people get

42
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:19,343
off subject, we could,

43
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:20,677
a little bit of crowd control.

44
00:01:20,677 --> 00:01:21,904
What about if everybody wants to talk

45
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:23,535
and they start raising their hands?

46
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:24,871
- [Girl in Gray Hoodie]
You get to pick on one.

47
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,033
- [Teacher] Yeah, task master gets to call

48
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,120
and make sure every body
gets their chance to talk.

49
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,991
Okay?

50
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:29,569
Yes?

51
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,884
- [Voiceover] Is there a praiser?

52
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:31,825
- [Teacher] Actually, that's a good idea.

53
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,507
Let's have a praiser.

54
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:33,255
- [Boy in Blue Shirt] I want to be him.

55
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:34,050
- [Teacher] You want to be the praiser?

56
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,428
Alright, Michael is the praiser.

57
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,886
What's the praiser do?

58
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,951
- [Voiceover] Oh, can I do that?

59
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:39,814
(class chatter)

60
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:40,847
- [Girl in Blue Jacket] Dang it, always.

61
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:41,774
- [Voiceover] You can team up with me.

62
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:42,354
- [Girl in Blue Jacket] Can we?

63
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:42,930
- [Teacher] This class,

64
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,085
yeah, you guys want to be a team?

65
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:44,667
Okay.

66
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,903
So, what is a praiser?

67
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:47,161
What are you guys going to do?

68
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,188
- [Voiceover] Give compliments.

69
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:49,910
- [Teacher] Okay, give compliments.

70
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,675
Compliment their ideas,
their expressions, okay?

71
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,140
And then I need a reader.

72
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,197
Preferably somebody on
that side of the room.

73
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:57,340
- [Voiceover] I don't know how to read.

74
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,030
I'm unavailable.

75
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,410
- [Teacher] You'll read?

76
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,230
- [Voiceover] No.

77
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,398
- [Teacher] Who would like to read?

78
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:04,394
(classroom chatter)

79
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:05,645
- [Teacher] About five seconds
before I call on someone.

80
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:06,419
- [Voiceover] I'll do it.

81
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,435
- [Teacher] Okay so,

82
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,714
the questions are all up here,

83
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:09,958
there's five of them.

84
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,350
You're going to read them so the whole group

85
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,113
can hear.

86
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:12,853
- [Voiceover] Okay.

87
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:13,943
- [Teacher] Okay?

88
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,684
Alright, so,

89
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:19,108
task master...

90
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,323
- [Voiceover] Oh, I'm here.

91
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:20,822
- [Teacher] Okay,

92
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,442
you're on task now,

93
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,718
and we're going to start by having the reader

94
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:27,018
read us the first question.

95
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,705
- [Girl in White Hoodie] Okay,

96
00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:31,261
should people own ideas?

97
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,998
(laughs)

98
00:02:34,998 --> 00:02:36,577
- [Boy in Varsity Jacket]
I don't really think so,

99
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:39,220
I think it should be shared,
like for public opinion.

100
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,752
Like, public knowledge,

101
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:42,313
like how they were
putting the genome stuff

102
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,088
out on the internet.

103
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:44,963
- [Voiceover] Great thought.

104
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:45,937
- [Boy in Varsity Jacket] Thanks.

105
00:02:45,937 --> 00:02:46,762
- [Girl in Blue Jacket] You're doing good.

106
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,401
- [Boy in Black Beanie] Well, I think that

107
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:54,148
the information should be shared,

108
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:57,338
but the people who found
it or came up with the idea

109
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,682
should get credit for it.

110
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,602
- [Girl in White Jacket] I think that

111
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,393
if you come up with an idea,

112
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,170
shouldn't you have some like,

113
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,545
you have conferences,

114
00:03:08,545 --> 00:03:10,745
everybody gets together
and talks about stuff.

115
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,343
So, why don't you have

116
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:14,746
scientists and stuff, that
like created this idea,

117
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,414
come together and have a
conference and talk about it,

118
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,144
so then ideas are spread out

119
00:03:19,144 --> 00:03:21,103
through all those companies and stuff.

120
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:22,584
And then the people that made,

121
00:03:22,584 --> 00:03:23,932
that contributed to it,

122
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:26,944
have like a patent, I guess you would say,

123
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:28,280
or just like,

124
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,531
copy, or not copyright it.

125
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,761
- [Voiceover] Like discovered by, or?

126
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,431
- [Girl in White Jacket] Yeah, like that.

127
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:33,740
- [Voiceover] Good opinion.

128
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,226
- [Voiceover] So, coming
together would be easier then.

129
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,942
- [Girl in White Hoodie]
Sometimes I feel like,

130
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,744
if...

131
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,428
If no one gets credited,

132
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:54,049
or gets, yeah. (laughs)

133
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:56,040
They won't want to

134
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,981
like...

135
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,335
They won't want to--

136
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,042
- [Voiceover] Put the
information out there.

137
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:00,649
- [Girl in White Hoodie] Yeah,

138
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:01,975
put the information out there.

139
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,226
Like they won't have something to,

140
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:05,498
you know...

141
00:04:05,498 --> 00:04:06,308
- [Voiceover] Work for?

142
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:07,063
- [Girl in White Hoodie] Work for!

143
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,515
There you go. (laughs)

144
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,032
- [Girl in White Jacket] Yeah,
because I think that everybody

145
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,736
like wants a part of
getting like (mumbles).

146
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:14,250
Because you want that credit,

147
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,635
because you put all that effort into it.

148
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:18,634
So, why not

149
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,291
get a little bit of credit?

150
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,010
That makes it worth it.

151
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,091
How do you like that one?

152
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:30,144
- [Voiceover] Okay, second question.

153
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,824
Should people own genes?

154
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:34,331
- [Voiceover] No.
- [Voiceover] Yes.

155
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,114
(class chatter)

156
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:38,119
- [Boy in Varsity Jacket]
Well, you kind of already

157
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,536
own your own genes.

158
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:41,938
I mean you kind of, they're your own.

159
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,839
Like any, unless you clone yourself,

160
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,263
I mean, nobody else has
the exact same stuff.

161
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,691
(mumbles)

162
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,519
You could.

163
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,106
- [Teacher] Let me give
you an example of an idea

164
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,847
of somebody owning a gene.

165
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:55,587
The breast cancer gene that
was discussed in the video,

166
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,690
which is actually a lack thereof,

167
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,507
of a particular part of a gene,

168
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,405
that is patented by a particular company.

169
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,990
Which means they found it,

170
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,618
they spent money to find it,

171
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:07,390
so they own the patent on it.

172
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,456
If you are a person,

173
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,652
you don't have to be female
just to look for this,

174
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:12,806
but if you are a person

175
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:15,027
who would like to go look for that gene,

176
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:18,512
you have to pay a patent
fee to that company

177
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:20,950
because they found it.

178
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,512
That's what it means to own a gene.

179
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:24,513
- [Girl in White Jacket]
I think owning a gene

180
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,905
is just having a company
that has a lot of money,

181
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:28,995
that can be like, "Oh I'm
going to put a patent on that,

182
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,085
"so boo-ya, can't take it."

183
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:33,425
- [Girl in Black Jacket] Yeah
I don't think that's right.

184
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:35,904
I mean, if someone,

185
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,518
they should like put
it open to the public,

186
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:39,642
because I mean if it's a
gene like, say breast cancer,

187
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:41,099
they should't just keep that private

188
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,313
and make they pay for it.

189
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:44,092
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

190
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,086
- [Woman in Glasses] So,
it's sort of like owning

191
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:49,453
a part of a human.

192
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:51,781
If you own a gene by a corporation,

193
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:54,820
it's like owning a part of the person

194
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,016
who has that gene, or
doesn't have that gene.

195
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:00,463
So...

196
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:01,990
It's sort of a moral issue.

197
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,880
Would you want to be owned by a company,

198
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,803
just that little tiny part of your DNA?

199
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:08,391
I wouldn't.

200
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,096
- [Voiceover] Excellent point.

201
00:06:09,096 --> 00:06:09,931
- [Voiceover] You would?
- [Voiceover] Good job, Jenna.

202
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:10,804
- [Voiceover] I wouldn't.

203
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,109
- [Voiceover] Oh, okay.

204
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:13,124
- [Voiceover] You
practically just went against

205
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:17,151
everything we just said. (laughs)

206
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,405
- [Voiceover] Anybody else have any input?

207
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:29,157
(classroom chatter)

208
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:30,734
- [Voiceover] I agree with Jen.

209
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,469
- [Girl in White Hoodie]
Okay, third question.

210
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:39,119
Would you want to know if you
carried a gene for cancer?

211
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,100
- [Several Students in Unison] Yeah.

212
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,940
- [Several Students in Unison] No.

213
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,822
- [Voiceover] I would not.

214
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,639
- [Voiceover] Well, it
depends on what age I'm at.

215
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,745
- [Boy in Varsity Jacket] Because like,

216
00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:46,073
then you have that whole impending like,

217
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,350
doom your whole entire life,

218
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,160
like, "Oh, I'm eventually going to get cancer,

219
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,498
"might as well just die."

220
00:06:52,498 --> 00:06:53,528
- [Boy in Black] That's why I die,

221
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,942
(mumbles)

222
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,193
- [Woman in Glasses] But if you do know,

223
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:59,410
then you have the chance
to actually deal with it.

224
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:01,537
- [Voiceover] You're going to
have to deal with it, anyway.

225
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:03,912
- [Woman in Glasses]
Yeah, but if you knew,

226
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:05,686
you would have all that time

227
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:09,484
to realize and to put things
in order in your life.

228
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:11,793
You would know,

229
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:13,443
you would live life to the fullest,

230
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:14,068
I would.

231
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,755
I would live life to the fullest if I knew

232
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:18,559
that I actually had this cancer.

233
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,681
I would know

234
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:22,155
and I would do the best I could to

235
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:24,008
live my life without settling.

236
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,441
- [Girl in Blue Jacket]
Yeah, so the shadow of you,

237
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,500
that eventually (mumbles).

238
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,787
- [Woman in Glasses] And that
would just push me forward,

239
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,943
considering--
- [Voiceover] Drive yourself.

240
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:31,520
- [Woman in Glasses] Whatever I do.

241
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,683
Yeah.

242
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,617
And maybe, just maybe if I knew,

243
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:37,383
I would work to try to cure it myself.

244
00:07:37,383 --> 00:07:41,465
So, then I would be helping
other people as well.

245
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,862
I would want to know.

246
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:49,416
- [Teacher] Remember that
there are no right or wrong

247
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,102
answers to these questions.

248
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:52,834
Please feel free to share.

249
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:02,605
- [Girl in White Jacket] I think my,

250
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:05,151
what's it called, my opinion,

251
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,541
I'd want to know so that,

252
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,398
if you didn't know,

253
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:13,457
and you have kids you could
be passing it on to them,

254
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:15,248
and wouldn't that hurt you to see that,

255
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:17,337
to have your kids have cancer?

256
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:18,873
Like, I would think that.

257
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,344
And then, if like I did,
I would want to know,

258
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:25,149
I would, like Jen said,
live life to my fullest,

259
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:27,003
and...

260
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,536
Because some things, like,

261
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:30,536
if I was, per se white,

262
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:31,949
I would go tanning,

263
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:33,523
wouldn't that hurt your cancer?

264
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:34,448
Because like, radiat--

265
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,736
Well that's what causes it,

266
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:36,632
you know what I mean?

267
00:08:36,632 --> 00:08:39,068
I'd just do things
differently if I had it.

268
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:45,109
- [Teacher] Remember what
they said in the video,

269
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,883
it's often a maybe.

270
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:49,138
It's not a "you will have this,"

271
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,236
it's a maybe.

272
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,565
There are things that they can check for

273
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,769
that they can say definitely,

274
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,056
you will or will not get,
like Huntington's Disease,

275
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,078
which is a very devastating disease.

276
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,489
Remember how they talked about Tay-Sachs,

277
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:00,888
which kills very early?

278
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,149
Huntington's is somewhat similar,

279
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,152
but it kills later in life.

280
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,665
And starts to show signs mid-30's,

281
00:09:07,665 --> 00:09:10,728
and usually death is
somewhere in the 40's or 50's,

282
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,496
so that's significantly earlier,

283
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:15,200
since life expectancy is in
the 70's in this country.

284
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,056
So...

285
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,539
Would you want to know,

286
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,322
yes or no, if you had
something like Huntington's,

287
00:09:21,322 --> 00:09:23,448
which is definitely a yes or no,

288
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:25,888
but what about in a
situation that's a maybe?

289
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,662
- [Boy in Beanie] I don't
want to know if it's a maybe,

290
00:09:27,662 --> 00:09:29,213
because then you live with that fear

291
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:32,262
that you might get it or you might not.

292
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:35,680
- [Woman in Glasses] I
would still want to know.

293
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,696
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
because what if your body

294
00:09:36,696 --> 00:09:38,410
starts shutting down like,

295
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,896
one night, and you just start

296
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,348
twitching in your sleep?

297
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,148
(laughs)

298
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,773
Wouldn't you want to know
that's from cancer,

299
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:46,515
rather than your brain's messed up,

300
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:48,835
and drugs or something, I don't know.

301
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,594
- [Girl in Black Jacket]
Yeah, I think I'd want to know.

302
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:51,626
I mean like,

303
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,821
instead of just

304
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,778
not knowing what's causing all this stuff

305
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,529
happening in your body.

306
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,721
Some think it's because I'm

307
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,250
a very curious person. (laughs)

308
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,441
I'd want to know what's going on.

309
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,518
- [Girl Wearing Necklace]
I would want to know.

310
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,525
Because like Jenna said,

311
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:07,824
like one night you're just
having a seizure or something,

312
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,931
you could take, like, medicine,

313
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:12,399
like that they prescribe to you

314
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,001
because they know what you have,

315
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,483
rather than just like,

316
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,207
trying to deal with it, and

317
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:18,249
like, that you could die,

318
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:20,481
because you never even
knew what was happening.

319
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:21,473
So I'd like,

320
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:23,840
want to have that back-up plan with me.

321
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,830
- [Teacher] So, just to clarify,

322
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,717
we're talking about an offense end,

323
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,017
rather than a defense team.

324
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:30,249
So, rather than waiting until
you have it and reacting,

325
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:31,953
taking preventative measures

326
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:33,393
ahead of time.

327
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:36,075
- [Woman in Glasses] Like
an inhaler for asthma.

328
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,055
Some people have to take their inhaler

329
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,919
every single day, twice a day,

330
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,462
morning and the afternoon,

331
00:10:42,462 --> 00:10:45,259
but there's other people
who don't have it as severe,

332
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,112
or a higher risk,

333
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:48,600
not as high as a risk,

334
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,810
who only take it

335
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,707
when they're having an asthma attack.

336
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:55,068
So, what you're saying is,

337
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:59,503
having like the pill
every day, constantly.

338
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:02,584
I would still want to take that chance.

339
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:04,536
- [Voiceover] So, you

340
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:05,831
would you want to take the pill?

341
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:06,851
- [Woman in Glasses] Yeah.

342
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,542
- [Girl in Black and
Gray Hoodie] If you know

343
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:10,805
you have cancer early enough,

344
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,156
can't you get rid of it?

345
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:13,583
Can't they get rid of it?

346
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,531
If it's like...

347
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:18,354
(classroom chatter)

348
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:19,955
- [Teacher] Yes, the earlier you know,

349
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,820
the better chance you have.

350
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,232
- [Girl in Black and Gray Hoodie] Yeah,

351
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:25,028
that's why I would want to know.

352
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:26,843
- [Girl in Gray Coat]
I don't think it would

353
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:29,800
matter that much because
even if you do have cancer,

354
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,436
that doesn't mean you're
going to die from it.

355
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,779
Like, you could get hit by a car today,

356
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,700
and nobody could tell you that,

357
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,058
nobody could predict that.

358
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:41,207
So, I don't think...

359
00:11:41,207 --> 00:11:42,963
I wouldn't want to know,

360
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,446
like if I was going to,

361
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:45,836
if I have cancer or anything.

362
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:46,957
I don't know, I don't think it's--

363
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:47,810
- [Girl in White Jacket] You don't know

364
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,943
that that cancer's going to (mumbles).

365
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:50,099
- [Girl in Gray Coat] Yeah,
and then I'm just going to be

366
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:51,685
in fear all my life, like,

367
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:53,321
thinking, like "Oh, I'm
going to die from that."

368
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,296
When that's not necessarily...

369
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:58,774
Like, the, you know,

370
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:00,948
exact thing that you're going to die from.

371
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:04,361
Like, it's not a guarantee, so.

372
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,232
- [Voiceover] Very good.

373
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:06,401
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's because of that--

374
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:06,986
- [Voiceover] Great job!

375
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:07,575
- [Boy in Varsity Jacket]
It's because of that maybe,

376
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:08,686
that maybe, like you might be,

377
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,750
like how that guy on the video said,

378
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,997
you have a 99% of
getting a heart disorder,

379
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,956
you might be that one
percent that doesn't get it.

380
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:15,119
And you spend your whole life preparing,

381
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:17,644
spending all this money
on preventative measures,

382
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:19,705
and getting all these
pills, setting up stuff,

383
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,026
and then you go through
your whole entire life,

384
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:23,595
and you don't even get it.

385
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:24,610
- [Voiceover] That's true.

386
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,059
- [Voiceover] That, he does have a point.

387
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,481
- [Voiceover] But then wouldn't you want

388
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,882
to take those precautions, because--

389
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,096
- [Voiceover] You'd be happy that you did,

390
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,881
but then you spent all that extra stuff.

391
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,316
- [Voiceover] But what if that extra stuff

392
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:34,819
is what made you not get it?

393
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:36,576
- [Voiceover] No I mean, you don't like,

394
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:38,795
you don't, get all the stuff just in case,

395
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:40,212
and you don't take,

396
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:42,590
it's like, you don't
even take the medicine.

397
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,347
It's only for like, when you have like,

398
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,198
Travis said, if you have a
seizure, you can take that,

399
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,245
it stops it.

400
00:12:48,245 --> 00:12:49,184
- [Girl in Black Jacket]
Well, that's kind of

401
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,235
just like getting hit by a car.

402
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:50,923
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

403
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:51,818
- [Girl in Black Jacket]
Preventative measures

404
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,130
is like, looking to see if there's cars,

405
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,572
and if you don't look I mean,

406
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,293
you could get run over, you could not.

407
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:57,826
(classroom chatter)

408
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,481
- [Boy in Black Beanie]
But then you also, like,

409
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:01,282
what if you lived in fear of getting that,

410
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:02,834
taking all these precautions,

411
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,203
is kind of wasting your life,

412
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:05,839
trying to prepare for something that

413
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,598
may or may not happen.

414
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,811
- [Woman in Glasses]
That's why people should,

415
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,992
at the right age when you
have the right maturity,

416
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:17,642
decide whether you want to know or not,

417
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:20,803
and not have it mapped
out when you're born,

418
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:22,616
whether you're going to die or not.

419
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:23,852
Or by what.

420
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,245
- [Girl in White Jacket] In
the movie, how they just like,

421
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:26,339
took that thing.
- [Woman in Glasses] Right.

422
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,007
- [Girl in White Jacket] That
would be freaky as a woman.

423
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,604
Like, you just went all
throughout nine months of that,

424
00:13:30,604 --> 00:13:33,001
and now you get to find out
that your child's going to die in

425
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:35,403
33.3 years, like,

426
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:37,242
it's kind of freaky.

427
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,497
- [Voiceover] That actually
brings us to our next question.

428
00:13:39,497 --> 00:13:40,663
- [Girl in White Hoodie] Okay.

429
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,824
What genes would you want to know

430
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,294
your children had?

431
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:45,980
Why, and how would that change

432
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,335
you as a parent?

433
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:52,267
- [Voiceover] I wouldn't
want to know, at all.

434
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:55,584
I mean, that's part of giving like,

435
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,693
human birth, the surprise, I guess.

436
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:58,710
- [Voiceover] It's a gamble.

437
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,026
- [Voiceover] You can't always like,

438
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:01,777
create the perfect human being.

439
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,839
- [Boy in Varsity Jacket]
Well, if you could find out,

440
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,311
what genes they were going to have,

441
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,493
could you fix them?

442
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:15,655
Like how that person

443
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,209
got rid of the forehead thing?

444
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,949
- [Teacher] Right now, no.

445
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:20,766
But that is

446
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:22,289
a direction we're heading in.

447
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:23,486
You can, right now,

448
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,929
completely sequence your child's genome,

449
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,399
if you have the money,

450
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,049
and get an approximation
of what they will look like

451
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,502
and what effects that--

452
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,436
- [Voiceover] That's messed up.

453
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:32,753
- [Voiceover] I don't care

454
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,492
what my child would look
like, I don't really care.

455
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,409
But, I just don't,

456
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,055
like you could prevent it from having,

457
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,763
these like, life-threatening diseases,

458
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:42,691
like cancer or Huntington's,

459
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:45,999
or like Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's.

460
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:46,760
- [Girl in White Jacket] But then again,

461
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,431
that's a way of like too, like...

462
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:54,314
I would want to know

463
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:56,795
life-threatening diseases,

464
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,825
but not,

465
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,760
because like you can cure, like seizures.

466
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,764
You can like, can't you?

467
00:15:01,764 --> 00:15:03,832
Like, my friend's been cured of that.

468
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:05,528
She had them and then now she doesn't anymore

469
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,218
because she took medicine and stuff,

470
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:08,637
now she doesn't have it.

471
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:09,746
But there's people that

472
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:11,872
have been taking those medicines,

473
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:13,439
and then still have it now,

474
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,808
which doesn't make sense.

475
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:16,739
- [Teacher] Is that cured, or treated?

476
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,188
- [Girl in White Jacket] Treated.

477
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:18,998
- [Teacher] Yeah.

478
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:21,980
Cured means that you no
longer have the disease.

479
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,275
Treated means that it's
managed with medication, or--

480
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:26,638
- [Girl in White Jacket]
It's treated, then.

481
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:27,703
Wait, it's cured.

482
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,645
Yeah, it is cured. (laughs)

483
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:34,042
But, anyways (mumbles).

484
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:37,726
- [Teacher] How would that
change you as a parent,

485
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,586
knowing that?

486
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:41,355
- [Voiceover] You would know
what to do if you have it.

487
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:43,808
- [Boy in Red Jacket] Stay
with your child at all times.

488
00:15:43,808 --> 00:15:47,008
(laughs)

489
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,151
I don't want my kid dying.

490
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:50,278
- [Voiceover] Your kid's
going to be in like a stroller,

491
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:51,508
until age 13.

492
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:54,548
- [Voiceover] See, it wouldn't
change me as a parent.

493
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:56,412
It just wouldn't change me.

494
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,877
- [Girl in White Jacket] I think
it'd make someone stronger.

495
00:15:57,877 --> 00:16:00,363
Because going through
all of that hard times,

496
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:02,501
like with your child and
it being sick and stuff,

497
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,254
wouldn't that make you
stronger than having

498
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:07,575
a normal, healthy child?

499
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:09,546
And make you closer to them?

500
00:16:09,546 --> 00:16:11,029
- [Voiceover] But you
would still love your child

501
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:12,222
the same way.

502
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,860
You would still try to

503
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,007
have the best memories with your child,

504
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:16,859
either way.

505
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,383
If you knew that this,

506
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:20,888
that your child was going to die, or not.

507
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:23,237
You would still do the same thing.

508
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:26,859
Except maybe change their diet, or...

509
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,389
- [Voiceover] Take more precautions.

510
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,201
- [Woman in Glasses]
Yeah, more precautions. Pad their room.

511
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:34,645
They're going to be falling over

512
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,614
and hurting themselves or something.

513
00:16:36,614 --> 00:16:39,109
But, you wouldn't change your experiences

514
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,280
with your child.

515
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,128
- [Voiceover] I would.

516
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,089
- Well, I wouldn't.

517
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:45,340
Would you Bernard?

518
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,977
- [Voiceover] What?

519
00:16:45,977 --> 00:16:48,099
- [Woman in Glasses] Change
your experience with your child?

520
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,161
- Yeah.

521
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,167
- [Voiceover] Just don't go to Disneyland,

522
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:52,974
it's not worth it.

523
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,694
- [Boy in Blue Shirt] It's not worth it,

524
00:16:54,694 --> 00:16:55,826
he won't even remember it.

525
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:57,274
- [Boy in Red Jacket] Nope.

526
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,173
- [Girl in White Hoodie]
Oh, the fifth question.

527
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,876
What does any of this have to do with you?

528
00:17:24,686 --> 00:17:27,288
- [Voiceover] Like as
in personally, or as in?

529
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:28,939
- [Voiceover] That's a good question.

530
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:29,844
- [Girl in Black Hoodie] I'm confused.

531
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:30,602
- [Voiceover] Say that again.

532
00:17:30,602 --> 00:17:31,804
- [Girl in Black Hoodie] As in personally?

533
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:32,970
- [Voiceover] Yeah, both ways,

534
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,182
as in persoanlly and as

535
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:35,555
in a generation.

536
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:40,555
(classroom chatter)

537
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,237
- [Voiceover] Give yourself super powers?

538
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,911
- [Girl in Necklace] Hey, stay on task.

539
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,138
(laughs)

540
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,082
- [Voiceover] Good job, Stella.

541
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,815
- [Girl in Necklace] Thanks. (laughs)

542
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,024
- [Girl in White Hoodie] I
guess you're just kind of

543
00:18:01,024 --> 00:18:04,361
getting us ready for the future, you know?

544
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:06,986
Like, thinking, like about your children,

545
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,395
like, in the future,

546
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:09,571
like what if,

547
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,289
like what if you really wanted to know,

548
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,386
and then like,

549
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,053
what would you actually do about it,

550
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:18,640
if you've never thought about this before.

551
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,846
- [Voiceover] Is this technology possible?

552
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:29,137
- [Several Students At Once] Yeah.

553
00:18:29,137 --> 00:18:31,113
- [Teacher] Not quite yet.

554
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:33,284
So, who's going to have to
make those decisions?

555
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:34,074
- [Several Students At Once] Us.

556
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:34,784
- [Voiceover] Our generation.

557
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:35,545
- [Woman in Glasses] This generation

558
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,961
and next generation.

559
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:41,303
(classroom chatter)

560
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:46,642
- [Woman in Glasses] The genes are us.

561
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:50,919
And if you want to know
everything about yourself,

562
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,449
if you want to know,

563
00:18:53,449 --> 00:18:58,032
then you have to go through the genes.

564
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:00,392
But if you don't want to know,

565
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:02,130
then you don't have to.

566
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,286
- [Girl in White Jacket] Yeah.

567
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:06,342
And so those people
that think it's like...

568
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:09,005
That want to know, should...

569
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:11,122
Wait, what?

570
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:11,886
Never mind.

571
00:19:11,886 --> 00:19:12,546
- [Voiceover] Should be able to.

572
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:13,656
- [Girl in White Jacket]
Yeah, should be able to.

573
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,016
And then, the people
that don't want to know,

574
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,475
shouldn't harp on them,

575
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:19,581
they should just keep their
opinions to themselves.

576
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,964
And see it from their eyes too,

577
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:24,826
and just have an open eye to it,

578
00:19:24,826 --> 00:19:25,887
not

579
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,697
being so negative.

580
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,874
- [Teacher] So what happens if,

581
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:32,950
say half of society,

582
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,438
would like to have
their genomes sequenced,

583
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,313
or their children's genome sequenced,

584
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,705
and the other half does not want to,

585
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,990
or doesn't have the means to,

586
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,163
because it's probably going to cost money.

587
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:45,108
Right?

588
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:47,238
What might that,

589
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:48,316
how might that impact

590
00:19:48,316 --> 00:19:49,692
society as a whole?

591
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:51,762
Not just the individual.

592
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:53,020
As in this country,

593
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,988
individual's rights are paramount, right?

594
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,021
Hmm?

595
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,186
- [Voiceover] So, it'll be messed up

596
00:19:59,186 --> 00:19:59,975
like it is already.

597
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:00,254
(laughs)

598
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:01,079
- How?
