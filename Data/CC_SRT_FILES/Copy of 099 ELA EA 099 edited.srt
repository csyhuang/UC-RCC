1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,924
(Background Chatter)

2
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,937
- [Teacher] So how is that energy?

3
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:20,353
- [Boy in gray hoodie]
Different things like jules.

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,463
Which are increments, which are similar.

5
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:28,693
(Background Chatter)

6
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,160
- [Boy in gray shirt] kilowatts hours and BCU

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,308
- [Teacher] Okay.

8
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,428
- [Girl in t-shirt] You could also measure
it with a thermometer,

9
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,617
if it's kinetic energy sometimes

10
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:37,313
- [Teacher] Okay.

11
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:40,795
- [Girl on the end] I have an cubic
feet, tons, and gallons, too.

12
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,189
- [Boy in gray hoodie] That's mass.
And volume

13
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,038
- [Girl on end] Oh, cause it was like...

14
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,128
(Background Chatter)

15
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:46,928
- [Girl on end] Hold on.

16
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:49,943
(Background Chatter)

17
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,289
- [Boy in gray hoodie]
Totally different thing

18
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:52,786
- [Girl on end] I don't remember

19
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:57,597
(Background Chatter)

20
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,027
- [Boy in dark hoodie] While she's looking at that,

21
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,708
what are some cons of nuclear energy

22
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,343
that most people are concerned about?

23
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:10,256
- [Boy in gray hoodie] Well, there are no

24
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,517
(Background Chatter) no explosions.

25
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:14,561
That's a totally different process

26
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:17,628
with nuclear bombs and nuclear power.

27
00:01:17,628 --> 00:01:19,327
- [Girl on end] Oh, I have...

28
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,788
- [Boy in gray hoodie] And it states, in lots of
articles, about nuclear waste,

29
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:27,330
that it produces very little waste.
At all.

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,022
- [Girl on end] Well I have a cubic feet,
it's for like, natural gas.

31
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,719
Tons is measured for coal.

32
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:38,567
Kilowatts hours is for electricity.

33
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:39,880
- [Boy in gray shirt] It doesn't 
pollute the air.

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,037
You could inject the water back
into the earth to reuse it.

35
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:45,556
Like you could put the water
back in and keep reusing it.

36
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,342
And then, the disadvantages
for geothermal energy is,

37
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,057
the gasses that are released smell bad

38
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:54,425
and efficiency is only 15%,

39
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,944
which isn't, it's not that great.

40
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:59,417
And there's a limitation of it.

41
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:02,099
You can't just like keep
reusing it and reusing it.

42
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,199
- [Girl in gray] I think that would 
be like a possibility

43
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:09,392
for a scenario, but like, we
don't know if it's warm enough

44
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:10,725
to be able to do that.

45
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,431
- [Boy in gray shirt] Yeah, if there 
was a good spot around our area,

46
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:13,824
it might be good but--

47
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:15,886
- [Teacher] How would you know if
your area was a good spot?

48
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:16,830
- [Boy in gray shirt] I don't know.

49
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,887
They would have to do tests and stuff

50
00:02:18,497 --> 00:02:19,443
- [Girl in gray] Plus,
I don't know that people

51
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,149
would want it in their backyard.

52
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:23,691
- [Girl in pink] It's hard because, Cranberry,

53
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:28,103
if we're thinking of
where those people, well,

54
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:29,647
like a civilized area.

55
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,551
People really don't want something--

56
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,468
- [Girl in gray] That smells bad.

57
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:33,664
- [Girl in pink] Yeah, that.

58
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:35,986
They don't want any disruption.

59
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:37,100
- [Teacher] And where are you most likely

60
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,548
going to see geothermal energy come from?

61
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:41,929
There are--

62
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,009
- [Boy in gray shirt] Inside of the earth.

63
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,182
- [Teacher] Right, but it's inside of the earth,

64
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:46,668
but it comes out in what ways?

65
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,484
- [Boy in gray shirt] In geysers.

66
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,900
- [Teacher] In geysers, or what else?

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,242
- [Boy in gray shirt] I'm not sure.

68
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:51,088
- [Teacher] Volcanoes.

69
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:51,675
- [Boy in gray shirt] Oh.

70
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,754
- [Teacher] Yeah, so, who, that's
definitely something.

71
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:56,429
You don't have volcanoes
everywhere either.

72
00:02:56,429 --> 00:02:56,827
- [Boy in gray shirt] Yeah.

73
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:57,741
- [Teacher] Right?

74
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,999
And you definitely wouldn't
want that in your backyard.

75
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,965
- [Boy in gray shirt] And sometimes, if
there would be a good area,

76
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:07,538
maybe the state, or the
country, would buy the property

77
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,745
to like put it there,
because it's a good spot.

78
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:11,610
Sometimes they do that
for like mining and stuff.

79
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,774
They like buy the property.

80
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:13,401
- [Teacher] Okay, Okay.

81
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,411
(Background Chatter)

82
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:17,732
- [Girl in pink] I had hydro-electric.

83
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:21,513
And some of the pros that is,
it doesn't pollute at all.

84
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:24,003
And the actual running

85
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:28,165
of the power plant is really cheap.

86
00:03:28,165 --> 00:03:31,183
And then it's really reliable.

87
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:34,166
So, say there was a big
power-outage in the area,

88
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:38,066
the hydro-electric power plant
could get that running again.

89
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:43,325
But, it's run by building dams in rivers

90
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:47,409
and they're extremely expensive to build,

91
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:51,160
which can be fixed by partnering up

92
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,018
with someone else who needs that.

93
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,456
A different, a business or something.

94
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,845
But it can also cause flooding upstream

95
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:02,195
for the animals, and people, and houses.

96
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,289
- [Girl in gray] I have a question for you.

97
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:06,972
Do you have to have like a big river

98
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,725
or could you use like a little creek

99
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:10,292
like we have around here?

100
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,681
- [Girl in pink] I don't think you could
necessarily use the creek.

101
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:16,583
- [Teacher] The Connoquenessing?

102
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:21,116
- [Girl in pink] Yeah, but, yeah you have
to have like a big river.

103
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:24,739
and it has to be fairly out of the way.

104
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:28,042
- [Girl in gray] Would it like cause flooding?

105
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:31,734
- [Girl in pink] Yeah, you couldn't have
any houses really upstream,

106
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:33,702
because could--they'd flood.

107
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:37,040
- [Teacher] And for example, your science book says

108
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,358
that the Hoover Dam, which
is on the Colorado River,

109
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:44,760
it created a waterfall of 400 feet,

110
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,314
which is more than twice as
high as the Niagara Falls.

111
00:04:47,314 --> 00:04:49,043
So you're talking about
a river that you would

112
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:51,098
have to be able to create that drop,

113
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,698
because the water creates
the kinetic energy.

114
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:54,778
Am I saying that right?

115
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:55,366
- [Girl in pink] Yeah.

116
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,310
- [Teacher] And that's what causes the electricity.

117
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:57,900
- [Girl in pink] Correct.

118
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,400
- [Teacher] So, if you could create
something like that

119
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,682
with the three rivers we have here,

120
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,848
that might, that might work.

121
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,228
- [Girl in pink] And again the whole--

122
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:07,482
- [Boy in gray shirt] Yeah, the three
rivers, that could do it,

123
00:05:07,482 --> 00:05:08,817
because there's a bunch of
big rivers in Pittsburgh.

124
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:09,526
- Yeah.

125
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:12,346
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, but if you build that
up, wouldn't that flood?

126
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,238
- [Boy in gray shirt] Well, not
in the middle of the city,

127
00:05:14,238 --> 00:05:15,747
you could maybe do it
like out of the city,

128
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,464
cause the rivers aren't just
like in the city, they go out.

129
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,773
- [Girl in pink] And also, if you have a good area,

130
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:24,073
flooding wouldn't matter so much,

131
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:26,261
if you pick the right area.

132
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,479
Which I mean, I guess, the whole thing...

133
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,590
(Background Chatter)

134
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,739
So definitely not in Cranberry, here.

135
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,033
Where we live.

136
00:05:35,033 --> 00:05:36,345
- [Girl in gray] Well we get a 
lot of rain around here,

137
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,870
so, I'm just... like flooding
would be like a problem.

138
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,689
- [Girl in pink] Yeah.

139
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,070
- [Boy in gray shirt] We're sort 
of in a drought right now,

140
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,707
there's not been a big
rain for a long time.

141
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:46,349
- [Girl in white] Does it harm the 
animals that are in the river?

142
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:52,087
- [Girl in pink] It's better for 
farmers because down the streams

143
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:56,521
the water is deeper and
there's more fish and stuff,

144
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,178
but there's less...

145
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,550
plants and stuff.

146
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,275
Like upstream it floods
the animals and homes,

147
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:13,523
and so it doesn't really
hurt too much down stream.

148
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,607
I guess it depends,

149
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,569
because the farmers need deeper waters,

150
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,369
but not if there's less life in it.

151
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,735
Because that's what
they're trying to achieve.

152
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:25,424
(Background Chatter)

153
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,733
- [Girl in gray] Rachel tell us about yours

154
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,229
- [Girl in white] My energy is fossil fuels.

155
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:36,047
The pros were that it's the most effiecent

156
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:40,117
of most of the energy sources we can use.

157
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:43,372
It's easy to find if you
know, in the general area,

158
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:44,336
of where it's at.

159
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,470
It makes up half, or more, of our energy,

160
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,270
in the United States.

161
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,482
The cons are that it's non-renewable.

162
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:53,174
There's a limited supply.

163
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:55,519
It makes a lot of
pollution when it's mined.

164
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:58,008
It's expensive to transport.

165
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:00,597
It harms aquatic life with pollution.

166
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:03,262
It takes millions of years to form.

167
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:04,841
- [Teacher] That's something I didn't
know about fossil fuels,

168
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,140
that it takes a very long time to develop.

169
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,432
- [Girl in white] It has to be, like, compacted.

170
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:11,337
- [Teacher] Uh-huh.

171
00:07:11,337 --> 00:07:12,591
- [Boy in gray shirt] So maybe the big plant,

172
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,112
it might be able to, not might be able,

173
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,552
it would probably run out fast,

174
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,234
if we started using it a lot,

175
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:19,268
so there wouldn't be a point
in making this huge plant,

176
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:20,497
and then it just run out.

177
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:21,252
- [Teacher] Yeah.

178
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,713
- [Girl in pink] So it might be 
something people would

179
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,931
use more often in the future.

180
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:29,722
Just little by little, like
just for little things.

181
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:31,731
What do you mainly use it for?

182
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:32,809
Like energy, but like...

183
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,494
- [Teacher] What falls under the
umbrella of fossil fuels?

184
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,921
- [Girl in white] Coals and oils.

185
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,654
- [Teacher] And natural gas.

186
00:07:43,654 --> 00:07:44,213
- [Girl in white] Yeah.

187
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:44,706
- [Teacher] Yeah.

188
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:45,814
- [Girl in gray] And you said it 
(Background Chatter)

189
00:07:45,814 --> 00:07:48,731
when you mine it, so we would
have to transport it here.

190
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:50,190
There's so many people that live here

191
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,838
that wouldn't want that.

192
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:55,568
- [Boy in gray shirt] Isn't that what 
happened in Mexico?

193
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,204
What's that called?

194
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:58,562
The Gulf of Mexico, yeah.

195
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,267
Weren't they mining for
fossil fuels, like oil?

196
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,329
- [Teacher] Oil, yeah.

197
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,066
- [Boy in gray shirt] And that happens, 
so that's like a natural disaster.

198
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,213
And that's happened a bunch of
times, so it's not that safe.

199
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:10,487
(Background Chatter)

200
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,452
- [Girl in gray shirt] So for our scenario,

201
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:12,666
what do you think would be the best two?

202
00:08:17,802 --> 00:08:19,695
- [Boy in gray shirt] Maybe nuclear 
around here, out of the way a little

203
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,622
so it wouldn't create any huge explosions.

204
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:54,475
(Background Chatter)

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,500
- [Boy in dark hoodie] So thermal energy 
transfers into electrical energy

206
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,538
- [Girl in gray hoodie] So it's kind 
of like biomass, cause they both,

207
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:01,101
you burn both of them,
except yours you use--

208
00:09:01,101 --> 00:09:02,121
- [Boy in dark hoodie] Mine's not renewable

209
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:04,885
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Yeah, yours, 
you use like uhm...

210
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,231
What's it called?

211
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,041
- [Girl in floral shirt] Like plants?

212
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,611
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Fossilized 
plants and stuff.

213
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:12,432
And for biomass you just
use waste or woods scraps

214
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:13,288
and stuff like that.

215
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:15,169
- [Boy in white shirt] Actually, isn't the,

216
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,467
isn't the fossilized, or
fossil fuels, or whatever,

217
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:19,767
don't they keep on making them?

218
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,984
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Yeah, fossilized, 
yeah, but it can't,

219
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:23,760
it takes so long to make them,

220
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,267
because you need all the
pressure and the decomposing,

221
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,103
like plants and animals,

222
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:30,146
that once it runs out,

223
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:32,664
it's going to take a
while for us to get more.

224
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:34,708
- [Teacher] Like thousands of years,
it takes to replenish.

225
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:35,548
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Yeah.

226
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:38,308
(Background Chatter)

227
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:39,525
- [Girl in gray hoodie] It takes a long time.

228
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,142
- [Teacher] Yeah, it takes a very
long time, for sure.

229
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,368
- [Girl in pale hoodie] So I think, 
Keeton, I don't think yours

230
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:48,619
would be the best for
our community to use.

231
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,650
- [Boy in dark hoodie] It's running out anyway,

232
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,566
yeah, so.

233
00:09:52,566 --> 00:09:55,038
- [Girl in floral shirt] How much
pollution does it cause?

234
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,002
- [Boy in dark hoodie] A lot.

235
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:59,728
- [Boy in white shirt] Why does the world 
just use it, if it's running out?

236
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:00,483
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Why waste it?

237
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:01,923
- [Teacher] We talked
about the efficiency.

238
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:05,212
What's the efficiency cost
of fossil fuels?

239
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,856
- [Boy in dark hoodie] I wasn't sure.

240
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,436
I couldn't find the exact--

241
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:11,337
Uh, 38 to 47%.

242
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:12,986
- [Girl in gray hoodie]
That's actually really good.

243
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,104
cause like biomass was
only 22 to 30 or something.

244
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:18,837
- [Teacher] So that may
have something to do with

245
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,335
what your decision is, right?

246
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,381
The efficiency of the energy.

247
00:10:22,861 --> 00:10:23,642
- [Girl in gray hoodie] I think so.

248
00:10:25,342 --> 00:10:28,932
- [Boy in white shirt] I just (Background Chatter).

249
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,236
You should save some of it.

250
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:35,072
You don't need to save
it but it's not that

251
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:39,258
good of an idea, to rely
on this energy source

252
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:40,964
that's not going to last forever.

253
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,194
- [Girl in pale hoodie] That's why I say, 
you could also

254
00:10:42,194 --> 00:10:43,901
use that as a backup plan,

255
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:45,920
because if we use
something that's renewable,

256
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,755
like Katelyn's, or something,

257
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,542
but something like a disaster happens

258
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,898
that could always be
our, just our fall back.

259
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:55,360
That we know we could
use that if we have to.

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,020
Just like an emergency generator.

261
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,692
It's like, you know it's
there, if you need it,

262
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:00,713
you can use it, and it
can last for a little bit.

263
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,519
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Since it 
is running out, would you guys say

264
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,013
that it would be better
for us to use it now

265
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:10,219
or save it in case--

266
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,158
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Oh, definitely save it.

267
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:11,774
- [Boy in white shirt] Save it.

268
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:12,738
- [Girl in floral shirt] I say save it, too.

269
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,233
- [Boy in dark hoodie] Now I actually 
think save it, because--

270
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,174
- [Boy in white shirt] I think probably save it.

271
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:18,112
- [Girl in floral shirt] I would say to 
save it because if something would happen

272
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:21,433
and then you would need
to use that specific type

273
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,093
then you'll be able to go back to it,

274
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,076
but if you use it all, then
you couldn't go back to it.

275
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:27,469
- [Teacher] So, what are you all proposing

276
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,918
as your primary energy source?

277
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:30,916
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Biomass.

278
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:31,915
- [Teacher] Okay.

279
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,388
- [Boy in white shirt] Cause it doesn't
cause that much pollution.

280
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:37,290
- [Girl in pale hoodie] And then they 
harness that pollution like Katelyn said.

281
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,578
They capture it and then they
use it for different things,

282
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:41,888
like growing trees or--

283
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:44,557
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Cause the 
only thing that, the only pollution

284
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:47,356
that really comes from
it is carbon dioxide.

285
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,595
And they have a way of
capturing the carbon dioxide

286
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:53,427
and using it to fabricate
metal and create paper

287
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:55,888
and use it in greenhouses and stuff.

288
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:57,815
- [Teacher] Wow, interesting.

289
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:58,628
- [Girl in gary hoodie] Yeah, I 
thought that was pretty good.

290
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:00,428
- [Girl in pale hoodie] So I think Katelyn's
definitely provides the most

291
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,051
for the community, definitely out of all.

292
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:05,512
- [Girl in floral shirt] Yeah, I 
(Background Chatter)

293
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:09,331
...have high effiecency rates
so you'll be able to get

294
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:11,954
like a lot of usable energy out of it.

295
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:12,629
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Yeah.

296
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,009
- [Boy in white shirt](Background Chatter) 
...the Colorado River, isn't

297
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,993
actually renewable energy's that good

298
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:19,152
of an efficiency rating.

299
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:22,774
- [Teacher] Actually, actually the...

300
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:29,486
the hydro-electric energy
is nearly 95% efficient.

301
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:30,795
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Wow.

302
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:36,207
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Once you build it, 
since tidal doesn't use any fuel either

303
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:38,667
It's just once you built
it, but the down side

304
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,605
on building is it costs so much.

305
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,928
So, I don't understand
why people would want

306
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,380
to use that amount of money whenever

307
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,885
because you could use
that on different things.

308
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,824
You could do it to create more biomass.

309
00:12:49,824 --> 00:12:53,417
Like if you wanna try to look
up ways to make that fossil,

310
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:56,097
plant roots, or plants,

311
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:59,812
just, try to find research to
make that happen more quickly.

312
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,991
speed up the process,

313
00:13:00,991 --> 00:13:03,163
so it wouldn't be a non-renewable resource

314
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:04,544
like fossil fuels or anything.

315
00:13:04,544 --> 00:13:06,691
- [Boy in white shirt] There's no, they said,

316
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:10,743
the small streams and like
rivers and stuff like that,

317
00:13:10,743 --> 00:13:13,646
they only create like a
small amount of energy,

318
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:16,885
and so we can't really do
that in Silicone Valley...

319
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:20,389
(Background Chatter)

320
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,247
- [Teacher] What about the
three rivers in Pittsburgh?

321
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,383
Could we not somehow harness that?

322
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,183
- [Girl in floral shirt] We were talking about that.

323
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,384
- [Boy in white shirt] I was like 
talking about redirecting the river.

324
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:32,568
- [Teacher] Redirecting the river.

325
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:34,182
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Just making one big one.

326
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:34,982
- [Teacher] Yeah.

327
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,139
- [Girl in gray shirt] I think that we 
would be able to use

328
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,422
the three rivers in Pittsburgh,

329
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,883
because they're all pretty big rivers,

330
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:48,125
so if we just put like one dam in there,

331
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,282
and then we harness the
energy from all three,

332
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:53,418
I think that we could get
a lot of energy from it.

333
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,007
- [Girl in pale hoodie] I don't think it'd 
be enough energy,

334
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,120
like to completely rely on it.

335
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,266
I think that we'd still
have to use other resources,

336
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,727
to still create energy
because I know the title,

337
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,420
it only creates 10 hours of energy a day,

338
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,462
but I don't know if that means, like,

339
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:13,640
an hour of that energy
runs like a power plant.

340
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,683
It didn't exactly say
how much energy is used

341
00:14:16,683 --> 00:14:18,006
to do one thing.

342
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,480
So, I don't,

343
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,325
I don't think that'd be a good idea,

344
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:24,181
to completely rely on that,
and put it in the three rivers.

345
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:27,397
- [Teacher] And doesn't then, the,
with the title energy, too,

346
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,696
there has to be a difference in the--

347
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,984
- [Girl in pale hoodie] The low and high

348
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:31,982
- [Teacher] Difference in the low and the high.

349
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:33,186
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Yeah, three meters of low and high.

350
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:35,122
- [Teacher] Yeah, so where did you,

351
00:14:35,122 --> 00:14:38,298
find out where in the world
there is that difference?

352
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:42,221
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Yeah. They 
said the biggest title...

353
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:45,020
it was in France or something.

354
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,620
But we don't have any in the United States

355
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,734
because we don't have an
area that we can put it in

356
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,497
that has that big of a difference.

357
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:52,415
- [Teacher] Oh, wow.

358
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,680
- [Girl in pale hoodie] So there's none used
in the United States,

359
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,682
and I don't think we could use that, then.

360
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,894
- [Girl in gary hoodie] Well, what you were 
saying before about how, like,

361
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:00,738
each energy source, we
basically have to fall back

362
00:15:00,738 --> 00:15:02,178
on another one.

363
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:02,793
- [Girl in pale hoodie] Yeah.

364
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:05,308
- [Girl in gray hoodie] Because none 
of them we could completely rely on,

365
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,040
to supply all of our energy.

366
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,517
I think that we would definitely
need at least two choices.

367
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:11,291
- [Girl in pale hoodie] At least two.

368
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,438
And if we had to pick
two, I would pick biomass

369
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:15,633
and then your nuclear because you said

370
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,139
a little amount takes it a long way.

371
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,440
- [Girl in floral shirt] Yeah, like 
you only need a little bit,

372
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,031
and it can produce a lot of energy.

373
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,178
And the efficiency rating's pretty high.

374
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:25,756
It's like 35%, so, yeah.

375
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,056
- [Teacher] Wow, that is pretty high.

376
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:32,130
- [Boy in white shirt] Remember you 
said it was like really hazardous?

377
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,833
- [Girl in floral shirt] Yeah, it doesn't produce

378
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,037
a lot of air pollution,
or greenhouse gases,

379
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:41,370
but if like one small accident is made,

380
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,565
then it can cause like
a really big disaster,

381
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:45,259
which would be bad for
a community of people,

382
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,186
since there are so many people in it.

383
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:48,022
- [Girl in gray hoodie] I think that--

384
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:50,856
- [Boy in white shirt] Katelyn and 
Kelsey were talking about like

385
00:15:50,856 --> 00:15:53,382
(Background Chatter) different kinds

386
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:54,485
of energy sources,

387
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:59,820
and according to issels, uh, issues...
