(No Audio)

2
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:08,316
- [Teacher] I see lots of
different levels of tennis.

3
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:10,801
I see some balancing levels.

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,913
Blake, why do you choose to balance this?

5
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:13,836
Who wants to share?

6
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:26,416
(Background Chatter)

7
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,245
- [Teacher] Keeping that ball controlled.

8
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:31,577
Back to back.

9
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:35,006
Catching placement, find a partner,

10
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,882
and standing with equipment on the ground.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,385
I've got two groups ready,
equipment's on the ground.

12
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,378
You're looking for somebody

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,467
you may have not worked with already.

14
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,531
You should have found a partner.
If not, you guys will start.

15
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,721
Thank you for placing the
equipment down on the ground.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,447
Lost and found?

17
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:07,739
Lost and found always come
to the start, very good.

18
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:11,647
When I say go, you're going
to turn to your partner,

19
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:13,481
I want you to talk to them about

20
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,656
what is a lifetime activity?

21
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,561
What I have on the board over here,

22
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:21,136
and I also have it on my screen.

23
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:23,658
Lifetime activity, what does it mean to

24
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:26,067
have a lifetime activity?

25
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,969
What does the word lifetime mean? Go.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,001
(Students talking among themselves)

27
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:46,921
- [Student] Bryan: soccer, baseball...

28
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,957
Maybe not.

29
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:50,647
- [Other Student] Soccer?

30
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:54,237
- [Student] Maybe one of those, yeah
maybe it could be, yeah soccer.

31
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,698
- [Other Student] Volleyball?

32
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:57,948
- [Student] Yeah, volleyball

33
00:01:57,948 --> 00:02:06,452
(Background Chatter)

34
00:02:06,452 --> 00:02:11,452
- [Teacher] And five, four, three, two, and one.

35
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:15,177
My partner and I, Zachary,
had some really good examples

36
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,494
of what lifetime means,
so I'm gonna use his.

37
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,122
Zachary said that lifetime means

38
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:21,815
you do it now, as a third grader,

39
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:23,946
but we could do it later
in life as an adult.

40
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,637
Raise your hand if that's what

41
00:02:25,637 --> 00:02:27,447
you and your partner kinda said?

42
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,908
It's something you should
be able to do later in life?

43
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:30,694
Very good.

44
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:34,397
And then we gave each other an
idea of what some activities

45
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:37,054
could be that we could
do now and later in life.

46
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:39,356
Zachary said two cool ones, "tennis."

47
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,640
Anybody else say tennis?

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,897
Awesome, pat yourself on the back.

49
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:46,455
And he also said "bowling,"

50
00:02:46,455 --> 00:02:48,637
and the reason those two
are really good examples

51
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:51,869
for having now as a third
grader, and later in life

52
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,802
is that they're pretty good on your body.

53
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:55,686
You can still do 'em,

54
00:02:55,686 --> 00:02:57,242
they're not gonna injure
your body too much.

55
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:00,418
It's gonna make you strong and healthy.

56
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:02,624
We have an organ in our body

57
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:04,924
that really needs to be worked out.

58
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,600
We've talked about aerobic capacity.

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,200
And tennis will make
your heart beat faster.

60
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:12,636
You have to find something that's

61
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,563
gonna make the heart beat faster.

62
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,583
So now turn to your
partner, talk about what

63
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,067
you're gonna choose to make
your heart beat faster. Go.

64
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:34,067
(Students discussing among themselves)

65
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,548
- [Teacher] And five, four, three, two, one.

66
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,730
Pat yourself on your back
for your lifetime activity,

67
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,780
that you're gonna choose, nice job.

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,652
When I say go,

69
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:49,424
you are your partner are now

70
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:53,302
gonna travel back to any open area

71
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:56,019
and stand back in face-off position.

72
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,503
So this is where my partner and I came,

73
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,569
and we put our equipment down.

74
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,553
Then we'll turn and look at the board.

75
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:03,622
Ready? Go.

76
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,840
Looking for an open spot with a partner.

77
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,480
Thank you for carrying your
equipment quickly and quietly.

78
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:18,960
Now, we're transitioning now to talk about

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,134
working with a partner and
doing some tennis challenges.

80
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:26,367
So far, we've worked by ourselves
to be responsible learners

81
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,920
Brian, are you looking for
your partner? He's right here.

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,077
So now we can work with a partner

83
00:04:33,077 --> 00:04:34,976
and be responsible learners.

84
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,016
On the screen is one of the challenges

85
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,036
we did with the balloons yesterday.

86
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,383
Zachary and Ms. Rock will show you

87
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,033
an example of what you could practice.

88
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:48,587
We're gonna actually
skip this level today,

89
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,909
but you could choose it, if you said

90
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,149
"Hey you know what, let's go
back to this other level."

91
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:58,056
So Zachary and Ms. Rock
both have our rackets,

92
00:04:58,316 --> 00:05:01,358
we're gonna practice
underhand striking keep up.

93
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,489
Raise your hand if you remember that?

94
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,973
Awesome. Alright, here it is.

95
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:10,031
I tick, step, tock, and
he's gonna strike back

96
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:14,648
or he can catch it, and then
I'm gonna keep striking.

97
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,381
We're gonna keep our
paddles low, go ahead.

98
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,649
Alright, I'm gonna wait 'til
it gets low so I can strike,

99
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:26,221
he's gonna also wait 'til
it gets low to strike.

100
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:28,352
Keeping that paddle low.

101
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:31,761
We're trying to keep it
up as long as we can.

102
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:32,894
Awesome.

103
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:34,532
So that was the first level.

104
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:37,313
Striking, keep up with the balloon.

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:42,375
Now we're gonna move to bean
bag challenges with a partner.

106
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,085
Super duper cool. It looks like this.

107
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,383
Only one person will need a bean bag.

108
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,822
Since I'm closest to the wall,

109
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:53,794
I'm the person to have the bean bag first.

110
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:56,720
I'm going to be the underhand thrower.

111
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,577
Zachary, go ahead and pick up your racket.

112
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,087
Create a flat surface.

113
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:01,991
I'm going to underhand throw,

114
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:05,473
he's going to catch it on his racket.

115
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,099
Take a step, tock. Good try.

116
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,605
You might have to reach
out and get under it.

117
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:13,706
Now he's gonna leave it on his racket,

118
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:16,869
and he's gonna underhand throw it

119
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:19,238
back from his racket to my hands.

120
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:20,148
Go ahead.

121
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:24,421
Take a step, tock. I catch, alright?

122
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:27,417
He needs to have three
tries with the racket,

123
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:31,939
then it's my turn to have
three tries with the racket.

124
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,560
Thumbs up if you understand.

125
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,578
Down if you got a question. Alright.

126
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:38,506
Person closest to the wall,

127
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:40,503
you will pick up your partners ball

128
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,988
and switch out one bean bag.

129
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:46,238
Bring it back, and place
it in your racket. Go.

130
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:52,398
Quickly, quickly, and five, four,

131
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:55,830
three, two, one.

132
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,145
You should have one bean bag
back on your tennis racket.

133
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:01,787
Raise your hand if you have a question.

134
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,426
So, partner with the beanbag
go ahead and pick it up.

135
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:09,642
You're the tosser first, with your hands.

136
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:12,120
You only need the beanbag.

137
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,996
You only have the beanbag.

138
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:16,333
Grab your place on your side.

139
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,165
Thank you, Christopher, for being safe.

140
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:22,160
We're gonna move through these
challenges fairly quickly.

141
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,018
We're gonna see how far we get.

142
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:25,852
We're gonna be responsible,

143
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,290
if the beanbag is not working so well,

144
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,976
you can go back to a--?

145
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:31,486
- [Students] Balloon.

146
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:34,638
- [Teacher] Balloon. Alright, let's practice. Go.

147
00:07:36,408 --> 00:07:39,380
One catching on their racket,
one catching on their hand.

148
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:47,075
I hear good communication with a partner.

149
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,690
You have to help each other.

150
00:07:48,690 --> 00:08:20,871
(Background Chatter)

151
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:25,138
- [Teacher] One person is underhand
throwing, one person is catching.

152
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:30,172
Awesome, if you haven't switched jobs,

153
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,837
go ahead and switch jobs at this time.

154
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:35,642
If you haven't switched jobs.

155
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,778
(Rackets clanging)

156
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,091
- [Teacher] See how many good catches you can get.

157
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,765
Give yourself a point for each catch.

158
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,834
Hands or racket.

159
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:58,923
Are you using the opposite
foot to step back with?

160
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,355
Both partners pick up rackets.

161
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,439
Both partners pick up rackets.

162
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:07,710
Look at the board now, you're gonna see

163
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,979
the toss from racket to racket challenge.

164
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,836
Count how many you can get. Go.

165
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:31,547
(Background Chatter)

166
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:32,372
There you go, Zach.

167
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,690
Excellent

168
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,613
- [Zach] One.

169
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:40,002
- [Teacher] And freeze.

170
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:43,367
(Rackets clanging to floor)

171
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:47,374
[Teacher] Alright, from here, I'm going to now

172
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:50,963
make you and your partner
be responsible learners.

173
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:54,231
We have learned to use a
bean bag with a partner.

174
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:58,225
We're gonna now learn how
to use both a foam ball,

175
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:01,031
and a large tennis trainer.

176
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:04,183
Both of these offer different challenges.

177
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:08,126
The first one is a foam ball.

178
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:11,047
As you can see on the screen,
they now have a foam ball.

179
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,946
Zachary picks up his racket.

180
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,889
We are doing an underhand
strike back and forth.

181
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,623
But like we did with the tennis ball,

182
00:10:19,623 --> 00:10:23,106
we can also catch it on our tennis racket

183
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:24,773
at any time we need to.

184
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:27,927
So, Zachary do you think
if I tossed this to you,

185
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,338
you could try catching it?

186
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:30,940
Alright, let's see.

187
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:34,726
Nice! He had to figure out how
to keep that balance on here.

188
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:36,624
He's gonna do the same thing back to me.

189
00:10:38,673 --> 00:10:41,733
This is just working on
looking for that ball,

190
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,196
getting our feet to it,

191
00:10:43,196 --> 00:10:44,793
and keeping a flat surface.

192
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:47,226
We can do the catching with the ball,

193
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,950
now we're ready for the tap offs.

194
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,668
Remember what we did with the balloon?

195
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:53,292
We're gonna try to keep the foam ball up.

196
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,940
This is what it looks like.

197
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,012
Tap, tap, good try.

198
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:00,859
It went away a little bit,
stop it, we come back.

199
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,826
I tick, step, tock. Good.

200
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:08,307
We're keeping a flat surface
coming back, slanted out.

201
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:13,295
The lower the racket, the
better control we will have.

202
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:17,539
I want the racket to stay
at a slant to partner.

203
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,043
Can you say that?

204
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,156
- [Students and Teacher] Slant to partner.

205
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,079
- [Teacher] So that's the foam ball challenge.

206
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,749
Some of you may just stay with the foam ball.

207
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,862
But, if you're like:

208
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:30,532
"I wanna challenge myself and my partner,"

209
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:35,083
I say "Zachary, we can now
use the tennis trainer".

210
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:39,627
And, it's going to bounce,strike,

211
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,504
bounce,strike.

212
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:44,731
The bouncing is gonna bounce
here, before I hit it,

213
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,728
then it will bounce in the middle,

214
00:11:46,728 --> 00:11:49,904
then my partner will strike.

215
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,318
Okay? Ready Zachary?

216
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:57,032
So, it's a bounce strike,
bounce strike. Excellent.

217
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:01,225
And I would come back and start
it over again if I need to.

218
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,712
Bounce strike, bounce strike,

219
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,910
bounce strike, bounce strike.

220
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:10,136
Catch when needed.

221
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:13,126
Were we controlled? Yeah!

222
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:15,424
When it got out of control, we caught it.

223
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:18,605
So from here on out, you now have

224
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:23,389
balloon to challenge yourself
and a partner with, bean bag,

225
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,246
What came next?

226
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:26,732
- [Students] Foam Ball

227
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,475
- [Teacher] And then?

228
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:28,543
- [Students] Tennis trainer.

229
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,308
- [Teacher] Excellent.

230
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:33,048
See how far you get with the
partner you're working with.

231
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:36,948
This uses communication and cooperation.

232
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:37,668
Say that.

233
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:40,594
- [Student] Communication
and cooperation.

234
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:41,569
- [Teacher] Excellent.

235
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:44,146
This is how it would look: Zachary,

236
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:46,468
what piece of equipment
would you like for us to use?

237
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:48,140
Or you think you're ready?

238
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,719
- [Zachary] The...

239
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:58,577
- [Teacher] The foam ball? Or the
balloon? What did you say?

240
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,514
- [Zachary] The end one.

241
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:04,467
- [Teacher] The end. He said he wanted
to use the tennis trainer.

242
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,672
"W" for Wilson, it's the brand.

243
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:08,646
I said, "Oh you know what Zachary,

244
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,480
"I don't feel like I'm ready for this one.

245
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,452
"Can we go back to a foam ball first?"

246
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:14,985
And he said "yes".

247
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,332
I'm all "phew, thank you".

248
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:20,023
We just had communication and cooperation.

249
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:23,483
I know that I can practice with
this one for a little longer

250
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,466
I'll probably be ready for the challenge.

251
00:13:25,921 --> 00:13:27,630
Alright, ready, go.

252
(Background Chatter)

253
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:15,631
- [Teacher] Are you able to keep your paddles low?

254
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,491
Keeping that balloon or
that piece of equipment

255
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,597
nice and controlled.

256
00:14:23,484 --> 00:14:26,312
Are you using an underhand strike?

257
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:33,836
(Background Chatter)

258
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:34,744
Alright, ready Zachary?

259
00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:39,360
Bounce strike, bounce strike--
let it bounce one time.

260
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,367
Bounce strike, bounce strike, good.

261
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,250
Bounce strike, bounce strike,

262
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,390
bounce strike, bounce strike.

263
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,712
Now I'm going to give you a challenge,

265
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:53,639
so I can go around the room
and see if anyone needs help.

266
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,986
You'll just work on tap ups,

267
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:57,702
you can use any equipment
that you need, okay?

268
00:14:57,702 --> 00:14:59,049
Tap ups, or tap downs.

269
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,292
If you and your partner
need a little help,

270
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,027
you can always raise your
hand, and I can come over.

271
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:09,599
Try to review those cues with you.

272
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,341
Underhand strike.

273
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:21,539
(Background Chatter)

274
00:15:21,539 --> 00:15:26,039
Okay bounce strike, bounce
strike, bounce strike.

275
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,172
Okay, say that, bounce strike.

276
00:15:31,751 --> 00:15:33,650
Okay, and if it's not working,

277
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,733
then you and your partner need to say...

278
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,404
"We need to go back to the--"

279
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:43,742
Be responsible, try it again though.

280
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,064
Bounce strike, bounce strike

281
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,504
Ooh this is where,

282
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:51,080
Aiyah, did she step
with her opposite foot?

283
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,146
Did you step when you strike?

284
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,275
No, so it's key to step when you strike.

285
00:15:57,275 --> 00:16:00,594
You gotta step. Try it again.

286
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,231
Keeping those paddles low.

287
00:16:10,991 --> 00:16:12,058
If you and your partner have to

288
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,403
move off of your self space a lot,

289
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,284
that's a reflection, you should say

290
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:20,812
"Ooh, we A, need help or B,
let's go to a different level."

291
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,855
Responsible word I hear.

292
00:16:22,855 --> 00:16:25,363
Which piece of equipment
are you going to have

293
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,965
the most success with?

294
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:31,427
And freeze.

295
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,977
(Rackets clatter to floor)

296
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,708
- [Teacher] Equipment should be 
back on our rackets.

297
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,798
Now, I see students at
all different levels.

298
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,795
So that shares with me that we have

299
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,047
some very responsible
learners in the class,

300
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:49,690
which is excellent.

301
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:52,110
But now, we're gonna see if
you can switch it up a bit,

302
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,643
and give yourself a challenge.

303
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:57,497
You should be able to work with anybody.

304
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:59,935
So what I'm gonna have
you do is, let's see here,

305
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,186
Ellie, Ellie is gonna step over here,

306
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:05,531
come jogging down, all the way down

307
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:09,613
to where Zachary is. Yay Ellie!

308
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:14,920
Ellie is gonna slide down one,

309
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,848
and that's gonna make everyone in this row

310
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:18,978
slide down to a new partner.

311
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:21,301
Where you going?

312
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,199
Very good, Zachary.

313
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,505
And then you go one
down, yep, there you go.

314
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,259
Now, wave to your new partner.

315
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:34,920
Excellent. Same thing here,
Harrison, come on down.

316
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,963
(Cheering)

317
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,306
-[Teacher] And slide on down.

318
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:43,320
Wave to your new partner.

319
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:47,296
Now you all of a sudden have
to have more communication,

320
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:50,681
because you don't know
where this partner is at.

321
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,210
Ready? Go.

322
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,295
Talk, which one are you gonna do?

323
