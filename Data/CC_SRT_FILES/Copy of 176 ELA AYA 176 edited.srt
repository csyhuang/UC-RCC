1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
(Students passing around yarn)

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,969
- [Female Student] Well I can start.

3
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:10,105
I just kind of wanted
to follow with Lina's

4
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,009
going back to the very
beginning of the book,

5
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,358
and sort of I guess a
response to Mariana's comment.

6
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:17,582
I think that a big focus of the book

7
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,532
is sort of that beginning
story with the starfish,

8
00:00:19,532 --> 00:00:21,436
like at the very very
beginning when she talks about

9
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,663
how one girl tosses back a
starfish and then she brings

10
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:26,266
all the other people
that toss back starfish,

11
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:30,352
so it's not about making this
huge change in one moment,

12
00:00:30,352 --> 00:00:31,861
cause that's never going to happen.

13
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,044
It's about that one step where you inspire

14
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:35,739
somebody else to take the next step.

15
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,736
And since we are young adults, you know

16
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:40,359
if we take that step now and we continue

17
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,355
taking those little steps
throughout our entire lives,

18
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:45,561
before you know it
things are gonna change.

19
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:48,138
So even though it seems discouraging

20
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:52,767
like "oh it's really hard and upsetting",

21
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:55,906
and speaking from personal
experience it can be upsetting,

22
00:00:55,906 --> 00:01:00,601
it's about continuing on and
taking those little steps.

23
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,086
- [Male Student] Yeah you know, at the same time I think

24
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:05,711
there's something hard about it,

25
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:08,358
but it's not something
that is beyond our control.

26
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:11,098
It's just--we don't want
to appear confrontational.

27
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:13,478
Because I thought we were
having this discussion on Friday,

28
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:16,729
I was listening in my
science and physiology class

29
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,026
to what people were
saying, and was listening

30
00:01:20,026 --> 00:01:21,930
if there were any instances,
although it doesn't count

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,668
as racism, you count it as
prejudice by definition,

32
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,077
I was listening for instances and actually

33
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:28,663
something does kind of fit.

34
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:29,950
Because there was this one girl who was

35
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,061
talking about how her stepfather was

36
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,569
or her mom's boyfriend was really mean

37
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:37,055
and was always cheating on her mom

38
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,448
and yelling at her, and he said

39
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,980
"Oh I wish you were white, he wouldn't

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,536
do that stuff if you were white."

41
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,417
This was a black girl.

42
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,530
There was this other,
in my physiology class--

43
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,108
- [Female Student] Isn't that not racism?

44
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,356
- [Teacher] Well, that's not--

45
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:51,795
- [Teacher] Do you think she was
serious or don't you?

46
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,397
- [Male Student] I don't know, but you
know even if it's joking,

47
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,683
it's still a pretty serious thing to say.

48
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:04,372
And besides, there was a Mexican boy

49
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:07,204
in my third block class who was

50
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,025
making fun of one of his friends,

51
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:13,930
some relative saying
get a bean or a shnean (sic).

52
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,668
But you know, even as jokes
these still have effects

53
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:20,454
and these are instances
where I could have said

54
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,544
"Well no, that's not an
appropriate thing to say.

55
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:25,028
"That could be offensive to people."

56
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,236
But you know I didn't, just because

57
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:27,652
I didn't want to be confrontational.

58
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:30,345
So obviously that's some fault of my own

59
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:33,637
for not getting involved there.

60
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:42,969
- [Male Student] Going off of what Tomas said

61
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:45,245
about the ethnic jokes or whatever,

62
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,915
I'm wondering if you're considered

63
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:52,915
actively racist if those
jokes don't bother you.

64
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:56,526
Like I hear that all the time in my

65
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:59,335
third block class, and
it doesn't bother me.

66
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:02,098
It's kind of funny sometimes.

67
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,649
Because a lot of the
time it's not interracial,

68
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,714
it's the same race.

69
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:12,425
You know what I'm trying to say?

70
00:03:14,387 --> 00:03:16,865
There's no Armenians, but

71
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,675
I can't roast another Armenian.

72
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:22,154
Should I throw this?

73
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:26,399
This is not gonna work.

74
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,883
- [Student] Laser it, bro.

75
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,043
- [Student] Maybe you
should just call on somebody

76
00:03:34,043 --> 00:03:35,942
and then throw it.

77
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:40,098
(Class laughing)

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,560
- [Male Student] I think while racist
jokes can show racism

79
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,411
they can also show an amount of...

80
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:52,642
show how comfortable we
all are with other races

81
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,962
and I make fun of my parents, I make fun

82
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:59,213
of my teachers because
I'm comfortable with them.

83
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:02,295
(Class laughing)

84
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,754
- [Teacher] Maybe we
should talk about that.

85
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:11,356
- [Male Student] And I mean, I can 
do it because we love each other

86
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:15,095
and (class laughs) it's okay, 
it's unconditional.

87
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:17,742
So even if they may get annoyed at me

88
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:21,335
we become stronger from
making fun of each other.

89
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:25,723
I'm scared.

90
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:33,345
- [Male Student] So going back to 
what Lina was saying

91
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,807
at the beginning and what Tomas was saying

92
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,919
a little later is with
the escalator thing,

93
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,608
I felt that was a good
metaphor for the system

94
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,688
but it also struck me as
a bit of a false dilemma.

95
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,479
She makes it out that
racism is the biggest

96
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,779
problem facing us today,
and not to say that

97
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:51,007
it's not a giant problem
but I feel like one can be

98
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,989
passively anti-racist
whilst working actively

99
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,891
towards anti-poverty,
anti-hunger, anti-war,

100
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:57,772
and making a difference in the world

101
00:04:57,772 --> 00:05:00,047
whether it's in the
field of racism or not.

102
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:02,758
And then going back to what
Tomas said about the...

103
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,727
and I lost my point, what was it?

104
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,883
It'll come back to me. Who wants to go?

105
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:16,065
- [Teacher] I think Tatum would agree with you

106
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,248
and she would even I think say that

107
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:21,777
while you're actively
combating say poverty,

108
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:25,538
you are having a positive impact for,

109
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:29,044
say poor African American families.

110
00:05:29,044 --> 00:05:31,951
And she points out the correlation,

111
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:37,481
statistically speaking
between ethnicity and class.

112
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:42,060
But one thing I want to say in relation

113
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,385
to some comments from over there is that

114
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:49,931
I think that one thing that it means to

115
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:52,160
become an adult, and I'm
thinking what Holly said,

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,897
is to suddenly be forced to think of

117
00:05:56,897 --> 00:06:00,020
global concerns and think beyond

118
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,786
our own individual needs and wants.

119
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:05,619
And I think it's really as simple as that

120
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:07,639
what Tatum is asking of people.

121
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,980
That she's asking them now you consider

122
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,413
your duties to the people around you.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,671
I want to hear from other people.

124
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,775
- [Student] I got my point
for Tomas, it's coming back.

125
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,563
It came back to me.

126
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,467
I had two points when I asked for the yarn

127
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,155
then I forgot one of them,
and I just remembered it.

128
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,689
- [Teacher] I want to encourage other
people to speak up too.

129
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,965
And we've got 10 minutes left.

130
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:35,280
There's a lot of voices that
haven't been heard yet today.

131
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,259
What I'm gonna do is something that

132
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,627
I'm gonna encourage
other people to do too.

133
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:42,367
I'm gonna toss it to somebody
who's not wanting to speak

134
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,409
and make them make their voice heard.

135
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,835
- [Student] I'll keep it short and then

136
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:46,810
I'll throw it to someone.

137
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,482
- [Teacher] Okay. Toss it to somebody who

138
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,177
doesn't have their hand raised though.

139
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,034
- [Student] So back to what Tomas said about

140
00:06:52,034 --> 00:06:54,913
the confrontational
thing, is it's really hard

141
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:58,874
to strike that medium between either

142
00:06:58,874 --> 00:07:01,799
being confrontational
or being patronizing.

143
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,835
And it's the fear of the
reaction of either one of those

144
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,786
that I think stops most
people from speaking up.

145
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:06,947
Like either confrontation
or you're appearing

146
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:08,363
patronizing and therefore destroying

147
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:10,615
racial relations even more.

148
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:13,471
So, Samuel?

149
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,648
- [Student] Yeah, sure.

150
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,634
Well I was gonna say out
of what Chris was saying

151
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:30,634
sometimes racial humor can actually--

152
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:36,025
I think while sometimes
it contributes to racism,

153
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:41,026
and I have a problem with telling too many

154
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:45,537
off-color jokes and gender-related jokes.

155
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,315
But I think sometimes that kind of humor

156
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:54,008
can start to eliminate prejudices

157
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:57,630
and bring that into

158
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,695
the broader dialogue and stuff.

159
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,972
So if you look at people like comedians

160
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,758
say like Dave Chappelle,

161
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,818
how many can say that he's

162
00:08:06,818 --> 00:08:09,604
a racist person because he makes

163
00:08:09,604 --> 00:08:14,016
lots of race-based jokes in his comedy?

164
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,874
On the contrary, I think he actually

165
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:20,466
helps bat those issues by
bringing that humor out.

166
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,941
- [Female Student] When Tatum mentions the fact that

167
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,681
she thinks there's no such thing as

168
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:39,134
being passively anti-racist,

169
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:43,342
I think what she means by that is like

170
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:46,383
it's sort of hard. I
actually got to mention

171
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:51,383
you know, our society we
have a lot of comic jokes

172
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,570
and all of these other things here present

173
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,570
in the system of housing and stuff is...

174
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,363
unweighted or whatever.

175
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,131
It's kinda difficult to...

176
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:10,834
how should I say it?

177
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,463
I don't know what I was trying to say.

178
00:09:13,463 --> 00:09:15,367
I can't put it out into words but

179
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,221
anyways, I kinda agree
and disagree with her.

180
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:24,221
It's like you can do
little things to change,

181
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,671
however what I was trying to say is that

182
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:32,874
it's a lot out there
and it may be difficult.

183
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:34,430
That was all I was trying to say.

184
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,885
I don't even know. Here you go.

185
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,170
- [Female Student] What I would say about

186
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,787
jokes and stuff at times it shows that

187
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:44,852
you know we're addressing
it sorta kinda in a way,

188
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,384
but at the same time it just shows

189
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:50,935
how much we see it played
out in our society.

190
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:52,305
And then for some people that say it

191
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,745
that aren't actually
trying to make a difference

192
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:56,740
it's like, I mean it's gonna
be hard to make a change

193
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,690
and be like "Hey, let me correct that."

194
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,035
Because to them it's just
like all fun and games.

195
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:06,845
But to us it's like, okay. Yeah. (laughs)

196
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:15,372
- [Male Student] It stopped.

197
00:10:17,653 --> 00:10:19,580
It died.

198
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,582
I agree completely with
what Laticia is saying.

199
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,780
Although for instance how Sam was saying

200
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,216
about Dave Chappelle,
although people make jokes

201
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,444
as they do address that in that manner,

202
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:40,718
it's not like people make
jokes so people understand

203
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:44,961
that "Oh, we need to
break these stereotypes."

204
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:51,395
I've come to realize that

205
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:54,640
every joke has a little
bit of truth in it.

206
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:59,855
Obviously yes, by making
these stereotypical jokes

207
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:03,399
yes we're addressing it, but my point

208
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,952
I guess is just it doesn't necessarily

209
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:11,952
prove that people are anti-racist.

210
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:19,142
- [Male Student] Alright, I just wanted to say

211
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:21,712
the question, the prompt is why is there

212
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:23,616
no such thing as being
passively anti-racist?

213
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,845
And it's because racism is so ingrained

214
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:28,074
in our system and our being.

215
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:30,396
From when we're born we're exposed

216
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,392
to racism consistently.

217
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,063
And because of that we can't
be passively anti-racist.

218
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:38,592
Our default setting for the
most part is being racist.

219
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,566
Not overly racist, but we are.

220
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,700
So it's not possibe just to
not be racist by being alive.

221
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,835
Once you come to being in
this world, you are racist.

222
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,414
You can't change that,
so that's why there's

223
00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:51,246
no such thing as being
passively anti-racist.

224
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:54,474
You have to work at being anti-racist.

225
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:56,558
It just doesn't happen.

226
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,930
- [Female Student] So I completely agree
with what Wyatt's saying.

227
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:04,930
The way I look at racism
is it's like a poison

228
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:07,964
and once you've been injected or

229
00:12:07,964 --> 00:12:10,786
you know, whatever to it,

230
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,946
it stays in your system forever.

231
00:12:12,946 --> 00:12:14,432
And there's always gonna
be a little part of it

232
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,498
no matter how much you try
to get it out of your system

233
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:18,774
there's always gonna be a
little bit of it in you.

234
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:21,699
So before you can fix the
people who have been exposed

235
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,600
you have to get to the source
of the poison and stop it.

236
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,362
Which would be parents or teachers.

237
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:30,755
I don't know.

238
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,241
- [Teacher] I'm a source of it?

239
00:12:32,241 --> 00:12:34,354
(Class laughing)

240
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,459
- [Female Student] You know like crazy teachers
who say the wrong thing

241
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,294
and then students go home and like,

242
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,780
"Oh yeah my teacher said this" and then

243
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,568
they go and tell their
other friends and stuff

244
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:45,286
and they kind of get passed around.

245
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,375
I don't know, it's not
you. I'm just saying.

246
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,535
(Class laughing)

247
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,851
- [Teacher] I don't believe you.

248
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,504
- [Male Student] Yeah, I agree with Wyatt and Brooks

249
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:57,267
because I think that

250
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:00,541
we were talking about how Disney movies

251
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:05,541
may have these subliminal
racist undertones

252
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,319
but at the same time,
there are racial undertones

253
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:12,547
to everything that anyone
says, basically, right?

254
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:16,933
There are always implicit messages which

255
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:20,602
aren't necessarily said overtly

256
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:25,564
which may come through to
the way people word things.

257
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,510
There are subtle subtle messages

258
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,576
and the attributes come
through peoples' speaking.

259
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,618
So everyone's totally surrounded by

260
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:35,731
all sorts of prejudices from
all sorts of different sources

261
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,121
from the time they can understand words.

262
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:41,512
So, yeah.

263
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:51,871
(class laughing)

264
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:56,006
If someone's gonna hit you in the face,

265
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:56,884
it might as well be this.

266
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:08,467
- [Male Student] I want to go back to
what Brooke just said about

267
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:12,321
parent kin thinking about racism.

268
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,155
I mean, how many times have you ever

269
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,918
hear your parents saying teach
you a lesson about racists?

270
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,797
They don't even try. (class laughing)

271
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:22,328
They might just give you some parental

272
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,070
info on your surrounding.

273
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,245
Or just say those joke
you were talking about.

274
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,330
- [Teacher] So you're
saying that you think

275
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,123
parents should have
conversations with kids?

276
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:38,397
- [Male Student] I'm saying that parents
should know how to

277
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:41,921
combat racism, and they don't even try.

278
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:50,007
- [Male Student] Going back to what Ryan 
said earlier,

279
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:52,561
I agree because if they keep using

280
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:56,996
racist jokes as jokes then
it will become overused

281
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,317
and kind of a cliché so people

282
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,768
won't want to use it anymore.
