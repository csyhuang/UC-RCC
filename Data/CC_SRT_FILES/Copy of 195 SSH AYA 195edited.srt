1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,375
- What were you saying, Joe?

2
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,743
- I said young people
definitely benefit our society

3
00:00:03,743 --> 00:00:05,181
overall more than old
people in the country.

4
00:00:05,181 --> 00:00:06,181
- Why?

5
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,876
- Just because they can--

6
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:08,526
- Progress.

7
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:09,641
- Contribute more. Yeah.

8
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:13,296
Like they can work and they
can help our industry grow

9
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:16,049
and provide opportunities for more people.

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,953
- Yeah, they're a lot more active

11
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:19,207
compared to old people more,

12
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:22,062
who just is gonna basically sit at home.

13
00:00:22,062 --> 00:00:25,041
- I mean if we look at like
the current political situation

14
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,504
in countries that are rebelling,

15
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:31,310
the rebellion is completely
composed of the youth.

16
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,309
- Yeah.

17
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,528
- If we look at the political
situation in America,

18
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:40,649
like Obama's election, was pretty much
the 18 to 21 year-old vote.

19
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,201
It's just like clearly,
they're like better

20
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,432
at affecting social change.

21
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:49,124
- In this time period
that we're discussing,

22
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:51,051
why would you want the youth to come?

23
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,419
- Well because this is like the start

24
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:55,207
of all social change in the union,

25
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:59,015
and I want young people to
bring a youthful energy,

26
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,546
and determination, and some sort of hope

27
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,752
about the country that they're moving to,

28
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:06,236
and that all, my union in here.
- [Matt] They're gonna progress,

29
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:08,326
they're gonna like technology,

30
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:10,601
and they're gonna invent stuff.

31
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,064
- So you're onboard with the--

32
00:01:12,064 --> 00:01:15,849
- I'm just saying we
still need more money.

33
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:19,076
They're going to be working
and they're going to be

34
00:01:19,076 --> 00:01:20,678
taking money out of our economy

35
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:22,373
because they're gonna want to pledge.

36
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,488
How much are they gonna spend?

37
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:26,855
Like we need old people to spend a lot,

38
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:29,269
like rich people to spend.
- [Girl in brown] But we need workers.

39
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:30,314
- Yeah, no, so it's like--

40
00:01:30,314 --> 00:01:31,196
- We need workers,

41
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:32,545
old people cannot work.
- [Matt] We need a combination.

42
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,127
If only get young people--

43
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,156
- If we look at this list of people

44
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:36,433
that we can bring into the country

45
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,082
that we were supposed to
look at to begin with,

46
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:41,055
the old people on this
list aren't that rich.

47
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:44,380
- Yeah, but there's
- [Girl in brown] The bottom line is

48
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,516
- Gonna be more than just
the old people there.

49
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:46,788
the old people other countries--

50
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:48,157
- But right now we're focusing on that.

51
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,342
- they're going to be
moving and they're rich,

52
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,363
who would move here?

53
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:53,150
Why would they move to
the "Land of Opportunity,"

54
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,936
if they don't need opportunities?

55
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:56,795
I didn't mean to say that!

56
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:57,979
(group laughs)

57
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:00,487
- That's honesty! Okay.

58
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,437
- Yeah but, I mean, I see that.

59
00:02:02,437 --> 00:02:03,436
- It seems like the majority,

60
00:02:03,436 --> 00:02:04,388
did the majority rule on that?

61
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,733
Because I guess, who was against having

62
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,869
younger people come in?

63
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:09,960
I know Matt was.

64
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,492
Was Matt the only one who
wanted older people to come in?

65
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:15,489
Ok, and you were--

66
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,055
- [Girl in brown] Also--

67
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:16,451
- [Matt] I'm a loner.

68
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,004
- You just went with the consensus?

69
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:18,579
- Yeah.

70
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,719
- Okay, good. - [Girl in brown]
Another point, another point!

71
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,946
Also, old people coming
from another country

72
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:26,081
just to spend the rest of their life,

73
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:28,031
aren't necessarily going to be

74
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,935
all that interested in America

75
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:30,632
- Okay.

76
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:31,189
- as a country.

77
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,071
- And wait, and also--

78
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,930
- They're not going to vote,

79
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,091
they're not going to, you know,

80
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,624
try to participate in the country itself

81
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:38,689
so they're just here to die in comfort?

82
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:39,664
(girl laughs)

83
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:40,593
- Okay, go ahead Darvel.

84
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,008
- On the way, it's already tough enough

85
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:46,583
to come across the sea to
get to the United States,

86
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,161
because so many people died
on the way getting there,

87
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,181
so they might die on
the way getting there.

88
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:54,153
- So don't even consider
them to begin with?

89
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:54,594
- Right.

90
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,523
- Or if they're sick,

91
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,543
they can't come into the country, anyway.

92
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,050
Like, we're not going to let people

93
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,467
who have cholera into our country,

94
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:04,704
because then it'll start
spreading here, so ...

95
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:06,138
- You said "colema" or "column?"

96
00:03:06,138 --> 00:03:06,672
- [Matt] Isn't that more in--

97
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,275
- Cholera.

98
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:07,949
- [Matt] That's like--

99
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:09,599
- Okay, I was like, what?

100
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,413
- What else did you
guys have on your cards?

101
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:14,695
What about religion? Does religion matter?

102
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,675
- [Matt] No.
- I don't think it did.

103
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:16,763
- No, no.

104
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,681
- That's one thing we, I
think we all could agree on.

105
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:18,970
- Yeah.

106
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,597
- Oh, everybody--

107
00:03:19,597 --> 00:03:21,034
- What about the nativists?

108
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,928
- What about the nativists?

109
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:28,895
Darvel, you were okay
with the religious freedom

110
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,311
happening in this group?

111
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:33,748
Well, I mean, it's kind of like

112
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,489
on the edge of the--

113
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,280
- He's conformed.

114
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,394
- But I (inaudible)
because most of the time,

115
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,763
it's Christianity in
the United States, so...

116
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,086
- Also, majority rule.

117
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:43,992
- Yeah, majority rules.

118
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:45,315
- USA! USA!

119
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:46,363
(teacher laughs)

120
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:48,593
- Okay, so who did you guys decide to,

121
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,311
wait, was that the end
of your criteria, or?

122
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:53,051
- No, we had-- - [Girl in brown]
There's still reasons for coming,

123
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:57,300
race, and knowledge of
English, previous jobs, and--

124
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,801
- Oh, what'd you guys say for English?

125
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,876
What'd you guys say?

126
00:04:00,876 --> 00:04:01,526
- They have to know English.

127
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:02,456
- Yeah, we said they had to know.

128
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:03,244
- Basic English, at least.

129
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,102
- At least a little bit.
They have to know some of it.

130
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:05,752
- Or--

131
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,075
- Enough to, you know,

132
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,070
find out where the bathroom is.

133
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,027
- Really?

134
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:12,581
- Or enough to like communicate--

135
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,556
- Or have the ability to learn it.

136
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:17,828
- With other people who may
not know English that well.

137
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:19,547
- And Boss, you were okay?

138
00:04:19,547 --> 00:04:21,242
- I mean I feel like I'm

139
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,844
one of the only ones
who disagreed with that,

140
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:25,816
because like being a boss,

141
00:04:25,816 --> 00:04:29,322
like I have connections like
in every part of my city,

142
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:31,388
and every community,

143
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:35,521
and communities are often
like separated by race, so--

144
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:36,334
- By race and?

145
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:37,472
- [Teacher] And language.
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,933
- So, maybe different communities

147
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,860
wouldn't have trouble communicating

148
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,439
if they only knew one language.

149
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:43,996
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:46,341
- But being a boss, with my connections,

151
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,454
I could definitely like,

152
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,775
I could make it so that
they could communicate,

153
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,375
and I can get them what
they need, help them out.

154
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,861
- Okay.

155
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,044
- I don't think now
English is a necessity.

156
00:04:58,044 --> 00:04:59,112
- Well you wouldn't--

157
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,596
- I think it's pretty,
I mean how are people

158
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:02,571
supposed to communicate?

159
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,334
And it's just going to make life miserable

160
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:07,331
for the people who are trying to make it.

161
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,721
Because I mean, overall the
majority speaks English.

162
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,785
- But we do have immigrants
in this country right now

163
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:17,106
that speak different
languages, so they could just--

164
00:05:17,106 --> 00:05:17,896
- They're getting by, though.

165
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,428
- Right, right.

166
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:20,264
- I don't know if (inaudible)

167
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:21,681
- You should know them,
working in factories,

168
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:23,724
you should know a lot of these people.

169
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,323
- Yeah, but-- - [Girl in brown]
You might even know someone--

170
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:27,340
- When I think of like
different languages,

171
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,453
I think of like the
Tower of Bavel, or Babel,

172
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:30,777
it's like in the Bible story,

173
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,493
where like everybody
spoke different languages,

174
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:35,026
and then the tower collapsed.

175
00:05:35,026 --> 00:05:36,697
So like, if everybody
speaks different languages,

176
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:38,555
we can't get work done productively,

177
00:05:38,555 --> 00:05:40,575
because we don't know
what each other want.

178
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:44,267
Like if we say, "Yo, go make this type,"

179
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:47,564
I don't know, just, "Do this job,"

180
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,143
and then they do something else,

181
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:51,581
you need communication.

182
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,881
- Darvel, what do you think about

183
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:53,903
the language piece?

184
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:57,339
- Well, I think that speaking
English is basically,

185
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,268
it's a necessity.

186
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:01,449
I mean, obviously, you would
want workers to come in,

187
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:03,701
because he just wants money.

188
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:07,114
He doesn't really think
communication is that important,

189
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:11,520
but as a nativist, I believe that it is.

190
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,958
- Why? What will happen

191
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,862
if we let a lot of people
come into the country

192
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:17,532
with different languages,
maybe be different races,

193
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:19,514
different ethnicities?

194
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:22,190
What will happen to the country
if we let those people in?

195
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,148
- I mean, that could create like conflict

196
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:30,253
between the work, because like Matt said,

197
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:31,545
they really wouldn't know what to do

198
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:32,940
while they're working.

199
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,718
Also, that could change

200
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:38,087
the patriotism of the country, as well.

201
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:41,886
- But will they know why they're working?

202
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:42,858
- Not really.

203
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,772
- So people who don't speak English

204
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,907
don't know why they're
doing a specific job?

205
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,347
- Well, probably, yeah.

206
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:50,297
I mean, they know that they're doing a job

207
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:51,110
to get money.

208
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,409
- Right, so does English really matter?

209
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,127
I'm just asking.

210
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,195
- I mean, they're not gonna really--

211
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:58,331
- X, you wouldn't care
if they spoke English,

212
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:59,515
because if they didn't speak English,

213
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:01,953
it might make it easier to exploit them.

214
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,085
- I somewhat care.

215
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:06,448
Because they have to
collaborate with the people

216
00:07:06,448 --> 00:07:09,330
they're working with to get the job done.

217
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,420
- The way I see it is,

218
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,044
they can come into the country with a,

219
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:15,249
you know, as long as
they have the mindset of,

220
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:17,687
"I should probably learn English

221
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,498
to succeed in this country,"

222
00:07:19,498 --> 00:07:21,031
then I think it's a good idea.

223
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,774
Because if you're going to
be immersed in a language,

224
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:26,259
you're going to be able
to learn it eventually,

225
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:30,229
so I mean as long as they
try to learn English,

226
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,131
or try to know basic English,

227
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,732
I think they should (inaudible)

228
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:37,682
- I mean, I think I agree to Darvel.

229
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:38,843
Like if I was a nativist,

230
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,329
I'm not saying I am,

231
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,699
but if I was a nativist, I wouldn't want

232
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,532
hoards of people who don't
speak English coming,

233
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,435
because I mean it's like,

234
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:50,501
America's pure, we've got
everybody speaks English,

235
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:51,662
like we don't want--

236
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:54,100
- But does everybody really
speak English right now?

237
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,656
- Not now, I'm saying--

238
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,778
- No, not right now in 2011,

239
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,193
but in our age that we're discussing--

240
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,287
- [Matt] If I was a nativist in my--
- Even then, right?

241
00:08:02,287 --> 00:08:06,653
- In my like Ideal world,
you would want everybody

242
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,324
to like speak English.

243
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:09,021
- Okay.

244
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,253
- The whole world should speak English!

245
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:14,663
- Oh, goodness! Yeah, that's
what a nativist would say.

246
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:17,055
- I went with the English speakers,

247
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:23,649
because like to properly
rebel and have a voice,

248
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,226
communication is vital,

249
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:28,989
and I think that people
who aren't speaking English

250
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:30,638
won't be interested in what I have to say,

251
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:33,656
can't even understand
what I'm saying, so--

252
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:35,467
- Okay, well you guys decide,

253
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:36,930
and talk about who

254
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,484
you guys are letting into the
country specifically, okay?

255
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:39,995
- Yeah.

256
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:41,110
- All right, thanks guys.

257
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,914
- Oh, we already did.

258
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,139
- [Boy in green] Education's
not really that important

259
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:47,629
to me, though.

260
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,764
- I think it's really important.

261
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,343
- Dude, it's saying that
a lot of these people

262
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:51,318
going into this country

263
00:08:51,318 --> 00:08:54,321
aren't educated to begin with.

264
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:58,503
- Well, education like-- - [Girl in
blue] You would want educated people.

265
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,987
- As a non-union worker, like
I don't care about education.

266
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:05,097
I just want to keep my job,
and I want like union workers

267
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:06,212
to get out of the country.

268
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,578
- And as a union worker, I
want educated immigrants,

269
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,947
because then they would
stand up for themselves,

270
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,874
and like change factory conditions.

271
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:18,564
- Me, being a tycoon, I just
want people to work for me.

272
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:21,142
I mean, they can come to this country,

273
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,953
they can live the American way,

274
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,183
I'll supply them with a job--

275
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,646
- What's the American way?

276
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:26,714
- American way is to--

277
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:28,734
- Well but you're not
giving them any money.

278
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,825
- Wait, wait, wait,
what's the American way?

279
00:09:29,825 --> 00:09:31,046
- [Boy in green] 2.5 kids--
- We are, actually.

280
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:33,090
- 2.5 kids, white picket fence.
- [Boy in green] Dog!

281
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,371
- Well that's the American,

282
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:36,204
is that the American way now or then?

283
00:09:36,204 --> 00:09:37,647
We're talking about then.
- [Girl in blue] Labrador!

284
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:39,543
- Basically, the American way is

285
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:40,867
- I want them to be doing better than

286
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,383
the country they were previously in.

287
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:44,533
- Okay.

288
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:44,813
- That's my concern.

289
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:47,612
- Well, but they came
here to like succeed,

290
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:49,330
and you're giving them
like two cents an hour.

291
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,002
- I mean, for me with education though,

292
00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:52,441
it's not that big of a deal,

293
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,949
because then again, if
they're coming to America,

294
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,876
they're going to have to
learn our customs and our way,

295
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,269
and with them being uneducated,

296
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:01,705
that's easier for us to
mold them into society,

297
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:05,537
and opposed to like we
can mold their thoughts

298
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:08,509
into like correct candidates to vote for,

299
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,530
and stuff like that!

300
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,979
- But this is supposed to
be like a free country,

301
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,095
and they came over here
because we like grant that,

302
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,907
and we're just like manipulating them.

303
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,044
- Yeah, but like basically,

304
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:18,321
the only people I want in the country

305
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,388
are like people that are
going to give me jobs.

306
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:21,642
Like people who are kind of like--

307
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:22,478
- Who are those people?

308
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:26,230
- Kind of like sketchy people,
kind of, because like--

309
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,892
- You want sketchy people
to come into your country?

310
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,896
- Well, sketchy people
are about to give me jobs,

311
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:33,057
because like sketchy
people are about to like--

312
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:33,963
- What do you mean by sketchy?

313
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:34,613
What does sketchy mean?

314
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:35,751
- When you're saying sketchy,
do you mean poor, or like--

315
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,607
- Nah, I mean like people
that are like rich and stuff,

316
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:40,789
and they'll like have a business
and whatever, but like--

317
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:41,950
- They're corrupt a little?

318
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,925
- Yeah, they're a little corrupt,

319
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,945
so they won't like hire union workers,

320
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,687
and they'll keep their people ununionized

321
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,427
so I can come in and take
the work, make that cash.

322
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:50,472
Know what I'm saying?

323
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,886
- Oh, okay. So you want it
that people will have money

324
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,349
when they come into the country,

325
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:57,298
but not be on the side of unions--

326
00:10:57,298 --> 00:10:57,878
- Exactly.

327
00:10:57,878 --> 00:10:58,784
- So that they will--

328
00:10:58,784 --> 00:10:59,644
- They'll give me jobs.

329
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,919
- They will, okay, they'll
hire non-union workers.

330
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,103
- They're not people that are going to be

331
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:03,939
entering the workforce,

332
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:04,798
they're people that are going to be like

333
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,816
already kind of upper,
you know what I mean?

334
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:08,629
- Okay, so you want people

335
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:09,883
with money coming into the country?

336
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:10,510
- Yeah, exactly.

337
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,296
- Okay. Did you guys decide
on a criteria already--

338
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:13,691
- Yup.

339
00:11:13,691 --> 00:11:14,573
- Or are you discussing a criteria?

340
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,177
- We have a criteria.

341
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,175
- This is our criteria, pretty much.

342
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:16,848
- Okay, what's your criteria?

343
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:19,913
- We said non-educated, which
some of us don't agree with.

344
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:20,796
- Who didn't agree with it?

345
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,282
- I don't agree with that.
- [Teacher] Why?

346
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,788
- Because--
- [Girl in blue] I did not agree with it.

347
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:25,750
- America is the land of education.

348
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,027
Everybody needs an education.

349
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:28,120
You can't come here--

350
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,885
- Well, but at this time,

351
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:31,741
remember education is
not like going to school.

352
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:34,759
It's more of knowing a skill or a trade.

353
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,433
- It's like street smarts, almost.

354
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:36,385
- Well, if they don't know anything,

355
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:36,879
then they can work.
- [Girl in blue] Yeah.

356
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,645
- Okay.

357
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,526
- And we decided on that--

358
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:40,617
- Do people really need
to know a lot, though,

359
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,801
to work in these factories?

360
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,636
- No, but like--
- [Boy in blue] No, my business is

361
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:44,722
to teach them how to use these machines.
- [Girl in blue] We don't want them

362
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,742
to be taken advantage of.

363
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:47,996
- I mean, but at the same time,

364
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:49,552
I don't really see the
importance of education

365
00:11:49,552 --> 00:11:50,713
if they don't come with like money

366
00:11:50,713 --> 00:11:52,115
or some type of,

367
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:54,501
like I don't know, some
type of prior knowledge

368
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:56,824
with like succeeding in America.

369
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,030
Because you may know,

370
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,795
you know how to read 100 books,

371
00:11:59,795 --> 00:12:01,165
but that doesn't help you like

372
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,674
start a business or something like that.

373
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:03,138
- Yeah.

374
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,368
- Yeah, but not like
that kind of education.

375
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:08,246
Like, education enough
where they know like

376
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:11,475
that two cents an hour is not okay.

377
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,738
Like so they can stand up for themselves,

378
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:14,760
and like be able to like

379
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,128
negotiate with you.

380
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:18,243
- Why is that not okay?

381
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,752
I mean, everyone has to get paid.

382
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,029
Everyone gets paid that same amount.

383
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:23,583
- Yeah, but they're living
in like cramped shacks

384
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,255
and like poor conditions.

385
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:26,045
- I mean, that's in your opinion.

386
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:26,880
A house is a house.

387
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,801
- Yeah, and then look at
where they're coming from.

388
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,547
They're coming from religious persecution,

389
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:34,054
they're coming from these
governments that are collapsing,

390
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,772
these war-stricken countries--

391
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:36,817
- Exactly, and the government--

392
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:38,419
- I think it's better
to work in a factory,

393
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,347
earn some wage--

394
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:42,947
- Yeah, but how much are you
earning compared to them?

395
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,224
- Eat or have necessities in life.

396
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:46,500
- I mean, but there's also
government support, too.

397
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,656
That's where I come in. I set
them up with a place to stay,

398
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:51,654
stuff like that, you know.

399
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:52,908
That's what government's here for

400
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:54,371
is support of people that come in here.

401
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,484
So it's best when they're not educated,

402
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,947
it's best when they don't have money,

403
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:00,245
because that makes it
easier for them to get help,

404
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,335
and that's what we're here
to do is to help people.

405
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,843
- But then they're relying on you

406
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,630
and they don't know what
to do with themselves,

407
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,443
like when you--

408
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:08,395
- They're relying on him,

409
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:10,299
but then he lets them rely on themselves,

410
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,669
so they come in, rely on him,

411
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,387
and then he kind of sends them, like--

412
00:13:13,387 --> 00:13:13,991
- How?

413
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:14,618
- Helps them out.

414
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:18,449
- How does he keep people
from relying on him?

415
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,494
- Because then, all right,

416
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,280
so I can help them decide
for who to vote for

417
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,925
in some type of election
that can help them

418
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:25,902
with their lives.

419
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:31,603
Like if there's a politician
voting for labor laws,

420
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,460
I can help them. If I'm
with that politician,

421
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,084
I can, "Yo, this is the
guy you want to vote for,"

422
00:13:36,084 --> 00:13:37,199
"This is the guy that will help you."

423
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:38,058
- That's like brainwashing, though,

424
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:40,705
they like have a right
to think for themselves.

425
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:41,982
- Honey, this is America.

426
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:42,632
- Exactly.

427
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:44,071
- Exactly! Exactly!

428
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:47,136
- So you're saying that
nobody should campaign, ever?

429
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,413
You're saying campaigning is brainwashing?

430
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,518
- No, you could campaign, but you don't--

431
00:13:49,518 --> 00:13:50,735
- Exactly, he's just campaigning!

432
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:51,832
- Can I just say something?

433
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,316
- No, but he's like getting
them all to agree with him.

434
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:54,895
- Okay, if you think about it this way,

435
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,218
you can really have people from

436
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,076
all spectrums of money-wise,

437
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,887
like from all kinds of
economic backgrounds.

438
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,184
You can have the more rich people come in,

439
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:05,715
sorry, the education backgrounds.

440
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:07,410
The more educated people
are going to come in.

441
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,640
No matter what, they're
going to help our country

442
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,078
more than hurt it.

443
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:12,959
Then for me, I can supply the people

444
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,023
who have gotten a lesser education,

445
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,114
and I can give them a job,

446
00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:19,600
I can start them off in life,

447
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,225
and maybe they can go to the library

448
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:23,775
and learn themselves.

449
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,402
- Why don't you better their
working conditions, then,

450
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:29,431
if you like are "helping" them?

451
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,590
- Because I mean, still,
this is much better.

452
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,935
- No, because they like
die in those factories.

453
00:14:33,935 --> 00:14:35,909
- It's better than being killed

454
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,209
by their previous governments.

455
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,657
- [Teacher] Wait, have we decided--
- No, it's not!

456
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:40,050
It's not the same thing.

457
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,068
- Have you guys already
decided on this piece already?

458
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,158
- Yeah, we have like our set laws,

459
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:46,807
we just have disagreements about that.

460
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:47,573
- You guys have disagreements?

461
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,732
So you guys were able
to a consensus on them?

462
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:50,963
- Yeah, well we kind of voted on it.

463
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:53,215
We decided that they
have to be non-educated,

464
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,142
come with some sort of money.

465
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,394
Their religion and race doesn't matter.

466
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:59,484
Come with a family--
