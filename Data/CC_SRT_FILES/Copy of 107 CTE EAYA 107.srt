1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,210
- Like the chocolate one with the
strawberries that we looked at, that is

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,640
going to serve approximately 24 people. So
if you multiple that by two that's

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,960
approximately $48 that you should charge
if you're going to charge for your cakes.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,930
Now it's going to depend on did you really
put that much time, energy and effort into

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,420
it and do you feel like you really need to
charge that? That's going to have a little

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,800
bit of basis to how much you are going to
charge, but that will kind of give you an

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,420
idea what to charge for your cakes. Think
about it too, serving sizes for cakes are

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,670
typically two inches square. They're
small, so when you are thinking, "But

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,370
that's a little cake" well, serving size
is tiny. It's not that you are going to

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,100
serve them a whole meal out of cake. It's
just for them to get a taste. Sculpted

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,800
cakes like the catfish cake that we looked
at, $100 plus. When I looked these up

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,690
specifically for something as big as that
catfish cake because it was a pretty good

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,740
size catfish cake. We tried to make it, as
realistic as possible and it was about

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,230
this tall. So probably somewhere at $150,
$200 level had we bought that at a bakery.

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,880
The wedding cake, like Jessie's wedding
cake that we've seen, somewhere in the

16
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,880
neighborhood of $600 because it was a
seven tiered masterpiece as well.

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,914
Who has a question? Come on somebody has
got a question.

18
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,049
- I wanna make a 3D cake.

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,240
- Okay, when do you wanna make one?

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,050
- I don't know.

21
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,830
- They're fun! So if you were going to
make a 3D cake, what would you make?

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,660
- Catfish!

23
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,790
- Okay! Britney's making a catfish! Okay,
Erica's making a dinosaur. Oh, my

24
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,860
favorite. Piggies, butterflies, what else?
What would you like to try?

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,230
Penguin, duck, basketball, panda bear
would be cute.

26
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,600
- A tire.

27
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,210
- Brandi, I wanna see your tire cake when
you get that done. A monkey would be fun.

28
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,400
[Background Chatter]

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,660
- That would be really cute.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,430
- So you guys are starting to think 3D. We
need to be thinking about your roses, too.

31
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,690
Because we gotta work on those roses and
get that technique down. Let's go over to

32
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,373
our table, and I'll show you about making
those roses.

33
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,580
Okay, so when we get our snow day tomorrow
I expect you to go home and practice,

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,730
practice, practice, practice, practice. If
it's snow we probably will get out. Watch

35
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,600
Facebook, Brandi. Or listen to the news.
That's how we'll find out.

36
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,620
I always post it to my Facebook whenever
they tell us. You guys already know about

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:02,860
fixing your pastry bags, and this one is
already fixed and it's all ready to go.

38
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,530
You know me, I like wrapping it up. One of
my just little tricks I like to use for

39
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,170
this, if it starts getting sticky on the
outside-- Which actually I know you have

40
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,110
struggled with this-- these are not my
friends. These are my friends. That's my

41
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,130
first tip. My second tip is if you're
going to use a plastic bag, take a paper

42
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,520
towel and just turn it into your handle.
And the other thing is, don't fill your

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,790
bag so full. It really only needs to be
filled to about halfway, maybe a little

44
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,970
bit more than halfway, okay? Then what
you'll do is you'll start rolling it down.

45
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,530
As you're rolling it down, typically what
I do first is I fold it in kind of at a

46
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,360
triangle. Then I start rolling it down.
The reason for that is so when I start

47
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,770
putting pressure on it's got both those
folds and then another fold to keep it

48
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,650
from escaping. Other people like to do the
toothpaste thing and twist. It's totally

49
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,110
up to you how you want to do that.

50
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,720
Either one is totally acceptable. Just
feel what works best for you, okay? Then I

51
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,570
make my little handle out of my paper
towel. Remember on the tips. You will

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,450
notice on the tips, especially the Wilton
tips, has a number. That number is

53
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,120
representative of how big the hole is. The
larger the number the larger the hole.

54
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,190
That works on the writing tips. Someone
tell me what number is on that one. Okay,

55
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,640
tell me what number is on that one, Erica.
It's on the outside. Okay, yours is a

56
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,560
number 12.
- Five.

57
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,720
- You've got a number five.

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,940
- It says a 230.
- Okay a 230.

59
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,510
- One.

60
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,530
- Okay, and why. A one what? A one M, that
means one monster. No, I don't know what

61
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,090
the M stands for. What is the difference
though between this tip and this tip?

62
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,470
They're pretty much the same thing.

63
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,990
[Background Chatter]

64
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,800
- What would you use this one for?
- For big cakes.

65
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,610
- Or for?

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,980
- Wait, don't! I got this!

67
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,140
- You've got it, okay come on, Ashley.
What would you use it for?

68
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:07,609
- [together] Borders? Borders!

69
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:11,460
- Yes, great answer! Absolutely. I'm
telling you by the time you have finished

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,210
your masterpiece and you're ready to do
the borders, get the big ones cause you're

71
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,800
ready to be done with it. If you pick one
of these little teeny tiny ones, by that

72
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,330
time you're sick of working with frosting
and you're ready to do something else. But

73
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,840
this one's just a number 16. See how tiny
that is? Okay, rose tips. The bigger the

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,880
number the bigger the holes. Also on your
rose tip, make sure that the large opening

75
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,360
end is going down. If this is awkward for
you, all you have to do to adjust your

76
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,950
tip, loosen it and then twist it around,
and then tighten your tip. You don't want

77
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,350
to tighten it so much that it's gonna take
a pair of pliers to get it loose, okay?

78
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,840
Let's see if I can get this back in
business. Okay, you've got your rose

79
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,530
nails.

80
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,380
You're just going to put a little squirt
of frosting, and it doesn't have to be

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,080
very big... and I'm making a big mess
now. Hold it down. Lay it straight down on

82
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:16,090
your waxed paper and now you've got your
basis for your rose. This is what we're

83
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,780
gonna build the roses on. We have to make
a pyramid of frosting to start out with.

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,150
Remember that on the Power Point? The
first one I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna

85
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,360
rotate this counter-clockwise and make my
little pyramid. See that little circle in

86
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:37,790
the middle? That's going to be the very
inside of the rosebud. Actually you could

87
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,760
pull these off after you let them set up.
Stick them on a plate or on a cookie

88
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,320
sheet, stick them in the freezer, and you
could have lots of little rosebuds to set

89
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,620
on your cake. Just add your little leaves
add your little vines and make you a

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,820
really pretty little rosebush out of that.
If you want it a little bit bigger, you

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,820
just squeeze and rotate all at the same
time. It's about pressure and release. So,

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,760
if you wanted a little rose you would pull
it off right about now. If you want a

93
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,780
little bit bigger, we're
gonna build it up. My frosting is getting

94
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:21,040
warm, but that's okay. There's a little
bit bigger one. It's starting to flop over

95
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:27,900
on me because it's getting really warm in
here. The more petals you add to the

96
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,200
outside, the bigger your rose is going to
be. Did you see that? It just about flew

97
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,612
onto the floor.

98
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,880
- Could you tell me what this would be
used for?

99
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,460
- Yes! That one is actually to decorate
cupcakes. So if we had a whole bunch of

100
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,510
cupcakes this is so you can do some really
delicate work inside the very delicate

101
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,240
areas. Like if you have them all lined up
and you're trying to do them really fast,

102
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,880
you can just do that. Usually what they
will do that for is you know the little

103
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,100
curly things that look like a little snake
on the top? Have you seen them? They just

104
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,980
go "shhhhh." That's what they use that
for.

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:08,320
It kind of is fun. One other way that you
can do your frosting pyramid is just go

106
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:15,920
straight down and squeeze and just bring
it straight up. So now we've got our cute

107
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,500
little middle of our cute little rose
going. Yeah, it sticks straight up and

108
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,600
we're just gonna wrap our little petals
around it. There we go. See how cute that

109
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,660
is? It looks just like one that you just
picked right off my little rosebush. Some

110
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,370
of my white roses at home look like that.
That one is cute that one's a good one.

111
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:43,360
Let's see if I can finish this off. We'll
do this one tiny. The smaller you want to

112
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,740
make them, you just add a smidge of
pressure instead of a lot of pressure. If

113
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,320
you add a lot of pressure you're gonna
make a big rose. It is, it's getting

114
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,630
really warm. Who has a question about
making these cute little roses? Okay, and

115
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,550
I know you guys are masters at using your
little star tips for shell borders. All

116
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,820
right, so lets see what you can do. I
think you got your tables set. Who would

117
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,180
like to use this tip. Simone? Do you need
a rose tip? Okay. I'll come around and

118
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,860
check on you and see how you're doing. I
want to see your masterpieces. I wanna see

119
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,540
a couple of good roses from each of you.
Kimberly, do you all need a rose tip over

120
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,910
here? Do you need that? Okay. Sorry, let
me get out of your way.

121
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,850
- Do we just do one or two?

122
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,700
- I want you to practice your borders and
I want you to practice your rose tips. So

123
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
if you have a rose tip at your table
you'll probably have to share. I'll come

124
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,700
around and check on you and see how it's
going and if you have any problems or

125
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,470
questions let me know.

126
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,968
- I have a question.

127
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:57,500
[Background Chatter]

128
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,990
- That is a good question.

129
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:08,950
It should be but it's not. Don't use this
one. This works best if you take your bag

130
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,050
and just snip it and just drop it straight
back in the bag. Because this coupler is

131
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,290
not designed to fit on this particular
one.

132
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:25,930
I'll get you a different one you can try.
Brandi, have you used the super star one

133
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,690
that makes-- have you used the leaf tip
yet?

134
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,760
- No.

135
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,910
- Let's try leaves. The big giant one?
This will not fit on here with your

136
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,150
coupler. You'll have to use a different
frosting bag. Most everything else that's

137
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,570
out you can use. This one-- actually you
might have fun with this one. This one

138
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,870
makes swirlies. Cool, it just makes lines
you just zigzag it.

139
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,820
[Background Chatter]

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,110
- All the star tips are right here.

141
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,920
- Err, not the star but the rose.

142
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,290
- No, I think all of them are out. You
guys will have to wait and trade out with

143
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,330
each other. Yep, they're all out.

144
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,570
- I just suck at this.

145
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:22,890
- No you don't! Let me see. Start with
this, Christina. Hold your handle. Handles

146
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,460
are our friends.

147
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,950
- Ooh, it looks like a square rose!

148
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:33,190
- It does look like a square rose, that's
cool. Okay, Britney make sure the big end

149
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:42,130
goes to the bottom. The small end goes to
the top. Remember your angles, too. 45 and

150
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,900
90. Sierra that looks good. Let me hand
these to Brandi and I'll be right back.

151
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,230
Brandi? Here.

152
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,911
- How do I make this one work?

153
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:57,130
- Oh, this one is kind of fun. This one
quite literally is something you'd finish

154
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,330
off, like if you're making grass you just
kind of swirl it around.

155
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,650
You can do it like this. Yeah, there are
two lines. Like if you wanted to do ziggy

156
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:16,440
zags. You can do circles. You know like
that. It's all about your pressure. Oh!

157
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:24,222
What happened? What happened?

158
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:25,569
- They're laughing at my rose.

159
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:31,720
- What's wrong with it? That's a good
start. Keep building on it. Now remember

160
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,690
Leticia, this big part right here on this
side-- that goes down. There you go. If

161
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:45,020
it's not in the right location You may
want to unscrew this and realign this. Try

162
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,940
that, see if that works better for ya.
Then remember you're twisting all at the

163
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,150
same time. You're making like upside down
U's, remember? Oh, you did miss that part

164
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,230
of the lesson, too, didn't you. All right,
let me show you and then I'll let you do

165
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,490
one, okay? What you're gonna do, this big
one always goes down. You're making like

166
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:13,030
an upside down U. Just like that. You're
gonna U and turn it all at the same time

167
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,140
so that it's a slow turn and this motion
all at the same time, okay? Then when

168
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:27,610
you're done you just set that aside and do
another one. Show me what you're doing.

169
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,510
There you go. Hold it just like that.
That's good.

170
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,860
Hey, you're getting there. You're making a
pyramid of frosting and you can do it one

171
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,430
of two ways. You can either do it this way
or straight up and down. Just make a big

172
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,930
glob of frosting, and turn this all at the
same time. There you go, just like that.

173
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,990
Pull your frosting off, there you go. Okay
now that's a good start, and now you're

174
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,820
gonna start making your upside down U's.
Usually you have three on your bottom

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,180
layer. There you go.

176
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,680
You're turning it all at the same time.
It's all about the hand motion there you

177
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,460
go, just like that. Just make little tiny
ones all around. There ya go that looks

178
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:17,020
good. There ya go. See, you can do this,
Leticia. There, oh look how beautiful that

179
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,560
is! It is! Oh my gosh. That's a perfect
rosebud.

180
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,480
- Thank you.

181
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,390
- That's it. That's all you have to do.
The bigger you wanna make your rose, the

182
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,720
more levels you put around the outside
edge, okay? If that's all you want then

183
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,390
pull it off, set it aside, and do some
more. That's it.

184
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,510
All right, you've got the techniques and
you know what to do. I'll come back and

185
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,120
check on you. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh come
on show me. Show me, show me.

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,320
- At least it's better than theirs.

187
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,880
- Hey, you're getting there. I think
you're doing the same thing that Leticia

188
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,230
was doing. See this big piece. You've got
it back. It needs to go down. If this is

189
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,580
awkward for you and you need to twist this
part of it. Just unscrew and re-navigate.

190
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,750
Britney, that looks good.
- Wait, it is on bottom now.

191
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,970
- It is now because I just turned it. When
you were doing it it wasn't. See how these

192
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:20,630
are heavy on top? That's the reason. It'll
be okay. Do you need some more?

193
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,020
- Is there anymore cut-out things?

194
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,040
- No, but there's stuff to do it. All
right, I'll come back and check on you.

195
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,520
Sierra, I'm gonna leave you in charge over
here. If they need some help, let me know

196
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,630
okay?
- Okay.

197
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:46,720
- Good job. Where are you over here? Yes!
Yes, yes, yes! Star borders deluxe. Okay,

198
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:52,000
so how are you doing? You're doing really
good on those leaf tips. Have you tried

199
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,010
any standing up? So you know how to do
that? Literally you start here and you

200
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,720
pull straight up on it at a 90 degree
angle.

201
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,450
- What?
- Just like that.

202
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:09,970
- Like that, sometimes they roll over. The
stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they

203
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,420
are. See how you can get them to stand up?
Just like that, or if you want them to lay

204
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,840
on the side.
- If you go slow they stay up faster.

205
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,670
- Yeah, and it has to do with the
consistency of your frosting, too.

206
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,320
Remember what you put in it to make it a
little bit thicker?

207
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,100
- Powdered sugar?
- Or you can do what?

208
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,300
[Background Chatter]

209
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:36,330
- There you go. Sarah! Sarah, I have never
seen-- Don't look. A big no-no. Oh man

210
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:43,020
that's good frosting. Okay, all right yell
at me. I stuck my thumb in it. I had to

211
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,230
lick it off.

212
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:54,580
- It's really good by the way. It is.
Don't do as I do, do as I say. That's kind

213
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,880
of like momma's say. Ya know, I'm your
school momma.

214
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,520
- It's not monkey see, monkey do. It's
monkey do what monkey say.

215
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:10,010
- I'm telling ya, today it's Ms. Morris is
doing something silly. All right, so Sarah

216
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,660
show me another one. Show me some shell
borders, cause I know you've practiced

217
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:28,710
those. She will, she'll be-- I'll be back.
That's cute. That's very stylish. Now, the

218
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,710
tip that Ashley has the one that looks
like the little grass that's got the two

219
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,890
holes at the same time. If you're gonna do
something real fancy if you'll do this one

220
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,390
white and then put a colored one in there
and do it back and forth it will kinda

221
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:50,420
look like this. Holly, try it again. Try
again.

222
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:57,386
- Where's the leaf?

223
00:17:57,386 --> 00:17:59,910
- Leddy's got one of them.

224
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:10,130
- Do you guys have one? Okay show her what
to do. It's pressure and release. Pressure

225
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:17,340
and release. That one actually turned out
really good. That one is a very good leaf.

226
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,670
When you're working on your leaves for
your cake this is what you want it to look

227
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,170
like. If they start breaking off like
this, you'll probably want to scrape them

228
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,720
off. It's just a matter of the pressure
and release thing. But those are looking

229
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:39,150
really, really good. I know I'm gonna
sneeze, too. Okay, maybe I'm not. Bless

230
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,199
you. Hey Mariah. Show me what you can do.

00:18:46,600 --> 00:19:00,320
- Oh, come on. Those are good ones. Those
are cute. That's a cute border. Samantha,

233
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,589
you're doing a really good job on that,
too.

[Background Chatter]

235
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,750
Kailyn, that is awesome. So, have you
practiced at home yet?

236
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,820
- No.

237
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,120
- Why not? I figured you would be-- I
figured you would be practicing every

238
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,060
chance you got.
- No, I don't have time.

239
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,460
- What do you mean you don't have time.
Yeah, Drew told me you're working on your

240
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,640
scrapbook. Good job, Brandi. All right,
show me something that you can do. I wanna

241
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,610
see somebody make a rose. I showed you how
now I wanna see them. Yes, I wanna see you

242
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:48,510
make a rose. Make another one. Oh, Let
me-- You can use my frosting. I'll bring

243
00:19:48,690 --> 00:20:00,700
you some.
Look, you did it! So what is the rule...
