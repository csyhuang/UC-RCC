1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,257
- Our goal is to find the
answers to your questions

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,329
so we can fill this column, what I learned,

3
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:10,746
in the KWL chart.

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,145
Okay?

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:16,327
So that's our goal.

6
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:19,980
Our goal is to find the
answers to draw a conclusion

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,397
to our month long experiment.

8
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:28,182
Before we do that, why don't
we take another measurement.

9
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:32,290
I would like you to measure
your plant, if you have any.

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,214
And I would like you to
count the number of leaves

11
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:38,307
on your plant, on one of them.

12
00:00:38,307 --> 00:00:39,855
Go ahead.

13
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:42,105
Scientists take your ruler.

14
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:45,930
Take your ruler

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,930
and measure.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,243
I like the way some of you
are holding your rulers.

17
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:56,927
It's great that you put
the lower number down

18
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:57,898
when you measure.

19
00:00:57,898 --> 00:00:59,403
Great!

20
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:02,653
If it helps you can pick up your plant.

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,633
Okay. After you have your measurement

22
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:11,736
and the number of leaves, make
sure you count the numbers,

23
00:01:11,736 --> 00:01:15,403
the leaves too, you may
put your plant down.

24
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,821
After you put your plant
down I know you are ready

25
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,530
to continue.

26
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,763
Could you touch your head
with your empty hands?

27
00:01:27,763 --> 00:01:28,930
Good job, John.

28
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,110
Touch your head with your empty hands.

29
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,753
Wonderful, I see that
you're ready, right Katie?

30
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:36,398
Put your hands down.

31
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:39,379
I also took pictures of your experiment.

32
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,129
Your pictures will serve as data.

33
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,834
That means the information you collected.

34
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,334
This group picture

35
00:01:49,973 --> 00:01:54,356
were from the people who
conducted the experiment

36
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,523
to see if seeds would grow

37
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,419
with soil,

38
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,585
water,

39
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:02,506
and sunlight.

40
00:02:02,506 --> 00:02:03,558
- [Class] Sunlight.

41
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:07,267
- We have air all around
us so we all have air.

42
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,206
I would like you to use
good listening ears.

43
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,823
Day one.

44
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:14,734
Day 11. That's what it looked like.

45
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,567
Day 18,

46
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,453
day 24,

47
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,289
and day 32.

48
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:23,862
We even have a ruler here, a primary ruler

49
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:26,800
that's easy for kindergartners to use.

50
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,598
Now looking at the data and your pictures.

51
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:32,932
What do you think the conclusion is

52
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:35,421
if you did this experiment?

53
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,474
If you planted the seeds,

54
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:42,284
you planted your seeds with
soil, water and sunlight

55
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:45,308
could you please raise your hand?

56
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:49,012
Good, we have some eager participants.

57
00:02:49,012 --> 00:02:50,862
Could you please come up here

58
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,485
with your experiment and a ruler

59
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:54,902
and explain to us?

60
00:02:57,422 --> 00:03:00,672
- My experiment was if plants will grow

61
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:04,096
with sun, soil, and water

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,310
and I put them near the windowsill.

63
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:15,226
- Why did you put your
cup near the windowsill?

64
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,590
- To get some sunlight.

65
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,978
- So your seeds received sunlight.

66
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,525
Did you water your seeds?

67
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,297
- Yes I did.

68
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:26,927
- Okay. And you did put soil?

69
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,344
- Yes, in the cup.

70
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:34,099
- Okay. What do you
think your conclusion is?

71
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,981
- If plants will grow in
sun, soil and water.

72
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:40,148
- And what is your answer?

73
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,076
- Um.

74
00:03:43,114 --> 00:03:44,450
- Did your seeds grow?

75
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,518
- Yes.

76
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,093
- Did you take a measurement?

77
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:47,926
- Yeah.

78
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,509
- May we see how tall they are?

79
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:54,561
How tall are they?

80
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:55,394
- One inch.

81
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,497
- Did you see how Kieran
measured his plants?

82
00:03:59,497 --> 00:04:04,019
He has the end with the lower
number touching the base

83
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:04,944
of the plant.

84
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,646
That's good scientist!

85
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,598
Now how many leaves do
you have on some of them?

86
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,735
- Four leaves.

87
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:15,988
- And how many did you have last week?

88
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:16,898
- Two.

89
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:20,836
- Two. So what do you think is happening?

90
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,026
- They're growing.

91
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:24,498
- They're growing because
you have more?

92
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,331
- Leaves.

93
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,081
- Wonderful! Great job scientist!

94
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:33,287
And now let's look at the next
experiment boys and girls.

95
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:34,120
This one

96
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:38,179
is planting seeds without water.

97
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:44,769
Did seeds or plants grow without water?

98
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:47,413
I would like you to look at the data.

99
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,509
This is your data just in
case you don't remember.

100
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,984
Sometimes we don't remember what we did,

101
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,375
but pictures help us.

102
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,964
Day one,

103
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:56,797
day 11,

104
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,258
day 18,

105
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,100
day 24,

106
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,943
day 32.

107
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:04,756
Hmmm.

108
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:08,621
I wonder what the conclusion is?

109
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,604
Oh, John you want to come up and share?

110
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:11,437
Great!

111
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,994
Take your experiment and your ruler.

112
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:17,452
And I really love the way Thalia listened.

113
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:21,619
- My experiment was if plants
will grow without water.

114
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:25,476
And I put sun, soil.

115
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:29,239
I gave it sun, and I put soil

116
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,826
and I never gave it water.

117
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:36,874
- How did you give it sunlight?

118
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:38,632
- I put it by the windowsill.

119
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,444
- Okay, so what is your conclusion?

120
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:44,918
- My conclusion is plants
will grow without water.

121
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:47,085
- Will grow or won't grow?

122
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,390
- Won't grow.

123
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,878
- Very good! Thank you.

124
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:55,228
- Thank you very much young scientist.

125
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:56,061
Great job!

126
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,133
And let's look at the next experiment.

127
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,466
Did seeds grow without soil?

128
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:06,632
Here's day one.

129
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,149
Again, scientists look at the smart board.

130
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,429
Day 11,

131
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:11,863
day 18,

132
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:13,102
24,

133
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:13,935
and day 32.

134
00:06:15,183 --> 00:06:17,419
Now, who did this experiment?

135
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,556
We would like you,

136
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:20,681
come on up Rachel.

137
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,681
Bring up your experiment and tell us

138
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:25,687
all about it.

139
00:06:30,637 --> 00:06:34,804
- I did an experiment if
seeds will grow without soil.

140
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,486
And I put seeds,

141
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:43,183
water in it,

142
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,558
and I put it by the window.

143
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,615
And I gave it sun.

144
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:57,460
And they didn't grow.

145
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,979
- What did you not use?

146
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:00,962
- Soil.

147
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,058
- You did not use soil.

148
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:04,141
And where are your seeds?

149
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,262
- By the window.

150
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:08,641
- They're in your cup right now.

151
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,645
- In my cup.

152
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:10,728
- Uh huh.

153
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:14,058
- Would you mind showing the
class what you have there?

154
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,647
Tilt it down.

155
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:17,292
Boys and girls take a peek.

156
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,542
This is what Rachel's seeds...

157
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,957
- I can't see.

158
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:27,826
- Okay. So now, what is
your conclusion, Rachel?

159
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:31,299
- Seeds won't grow without soil.

160
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,132
- Very good.

161
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,368
Thank you scientist.

162
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:36,109
We have nothing to
measure in Rachel's cup.

163
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,487
And the last one.

164
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,384
Oh, boys and girls this is
a very interesting one.

165
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:44,055
I really would like you to look up here.

166
00:07:44,055 --> 00:07:46,615
Look at the data first.

167
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:50,115
Did seeds or plants grow without sunlight?

168
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,699
A lot of your cups were by the window

169
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,245
so that they received sunlight.

170
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,299
But look at this one.

171
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:00,762
Day one.

172
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:01,972
Do you have anything?

173
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,335
- [Voiceover] No.

174
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,168
- No.

175
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:05,404
Day 11.

176
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:06,237
- [Voiceover] No.

177
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:09,101
- Day 18, look at the number.

178
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,815
Look at the numbers on the ruler.

179
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:15,514
Day 24, I want you to look at your data.

180
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:16,431
And day 32.

181
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:23,179
Well, that's some interesting experiment.

182
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:24,698
I know some of you did this one.

183
00:08:24,698 --> 00:08:26,357
Quite a number of children.

184
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:28,044
If you did that experiment

185
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:31,266
and you would like to come up and talk

186
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:32,766
nicely and loudly.

187
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:37,495
Juliana would you please
come up with your plant

188
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:40,884
and your ruler if you would like?

189
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,362
Come on up.

190
00:08:42,362 --> 00:08:43,936
Okay, John you're going to show Juliana

191
00:08:43,936 --> 00:08:46,853
what a good listener you are, okay?

192
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:48,955
Go ahead buddy.

193
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,441
- I planted seeds without sun.

194
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:58,589
And I put them in the closet.

195
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:03,361
- Did you cover your seeds with soil?

196
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:05,664
- Yes.

197
00:09:05,664 --> 00:09:07,831
- So your seeds have soil.

198
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,120
- Soil.

199
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,470
- You watered them?

200
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,989
- Watered them.

201
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,904
- Every week you watered them? And?

202
00:09:15,904 --> 00:09:16,904
- And no sun.

203
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:21,935
- And you did not give them any sunlight

204
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:24,044
because you put them in--

205
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:24,877
- The closet.

206
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:27,405
- In the closet and the closet has no?

207
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:28,238
- Sun.

208
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,377
- Has no sunlight.

209
00:09:29,377 --> 00:09:30,570
It has no windows.

210
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,681
Right, John?

211
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,848
Now Juliana, tell the class
if you ever had any sprouts.

212
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:40,701
- I did have sprouts.

213
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,817
- And what do you think happened?

214
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,463
- They died.

215
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:49,063
- How tall were your sprouts at one point.

216
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:50,132
- One inch.

217
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:54,069
- One inch and why do you think they died?

218
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:56,236
- Because they had no sun.

219
00:09:57,248 --> 00:10:01,415
- And do you think the sun is
important for plants to grow?

220
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,378
So what is your conclusion?

221
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:07,295
- No, seeds won't grow without sun.

222
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:09,765
- Very good.

223
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,410
Good job scientist.

224
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,592
You may go back.

225
00:10:12,592 --> 00:10:14,175
Now boys and girls,

226
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:17,223
I'm going to ask you to

227
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,932
think about your experiment.

228
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:23,849
Think about what your question was.

229
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,822
What you wanted to find out.

230
00:10:27,822 --> 00:10:31,945
And the steps you took
to do your experiment.

231
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:35,374
And you are going to turn to your partner

232
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,041
and ask your partner

233
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,407
what they wanted to find out.

234
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,909
You may say, "What was your question?"

235
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,904
Or, "What do you want to find out?"

236
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,423
And here's a big question mark.

237
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:53,431
And after your partner
answers then you may ask,

238
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,699
"What did you do?"

239
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,835
"What steps did you take?"

240
00:10:56,835 --> 00:11:00,364
And at the end we will like
you to ask your partner,

241
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:02,031
"What is your answer?"

242
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:06,018
How did you know that's the answer?

243
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,536
They have to tell you their evidence,

244
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:11,882
what they used to tell you the answer.

245
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:14,430
Okay, now turn to your partner

246
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,246
and talk to each other.

247
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:18,633
Remember how we work as partners.

248
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,095
[Class] What did you find out?

249
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,894
[Class] What was your question?
- My question was...

250
00:11:22,894 --> 00:12:07,061
(students talking over each other)

251
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:15,325
- [Teacher] Take turns.

252
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:19,492
(students talking over each other)

253
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,284
Gabby, take turns

254
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:56,783
(students talking over each other)

255
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,166
Boys and girls, let's take 30 more seconds.

256
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:06,160
If you need to use your
plants as your evidence

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,763
feel free.

258
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:21,930
(students talking over each other)

259
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,469
Okay, boys and girls turn around.

260
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,324
Please put your hands on your lap

261
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:30,824
so I can see your empty hands.

262
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:33,699
Alright.

263
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:37,588
Let's look at the answers again.

264
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,714
Our whole experiment,

265
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:43,640
and let's look at the questions.

266
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,490
Will seeds grow without water?

267
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,839
What do you think?

268
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,420
- [Class] No.

269
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,572
- If you don't think seeds
will grow without water

270
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:51,905
shake your head.

271
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:53,599
Great.

272
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:59,840
Cameron will seeds grow without water?

273
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,021
- No.

274
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:02,006
- No, good.

275
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,673
Okay, next question.

276
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:07,519
Will seeds grow without sunlight?

277
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,882
- [Class] No.

278
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,484
- Let me see you touch your
ears if you don't think

279
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,151
seeds will grow without sunlight.

280
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,311
Okay, let's see.

281
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:20,442
Will they Cameron?

282
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,766
- No.

283
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,633
- Touch your ears so I
know you understand.

284
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:25,941
Next one,

285
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,358
will seeds grow without soil?

286
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,163
Yes or no?

287
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:32,537
[Class] Yes. No.

288
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,195
- Will seeds grow without soil?

289
00:14:35,195 --> 00:14:36,728
- [Class] NO!

290
00:14:36,728 --> 00:14:38,696
- No. Touch the ground,

291
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:39,920
touch the rug.

292
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,920
Okay, great.

293
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:44,691
The last question, Katie, is

294
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:48,108
will seeds grow with water, sun and soil?

295
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,072
- [Class] Yes.

296
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,235
- Good. Then make some rain drops.

297
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:59,152
Make the sun and form a
cup to hold your soil.
