1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,517
- [Boy in white] More important, 'cause 
their friend Maser-- [sic] something

2
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:06,517
died the day before, and they
stayed in the village for

3
00:00:06,517 --> 00:00:09,967
that long. They didn't have
to stay, but they decided

4
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:13,018
to stay. They didn't have to
do that, but they just chose

5
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:15,697
to do that because they
felt it was more important.

6
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:18,048
- [Teacher] Well, and it may have been
a choice for safety also,

7
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:20,780
if they stay with him. If
they run to another village,

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,757
they may be, you know, picked off.

9
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,537
- [Girl in striped shirt] Trying to stick 
to the customs that they are so used to,

10
00:00:25,537 --> 00:00:29,017
like back in normal life, and
stuff like that. So, trying

11
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:31,950
to get back in that. But,
the fact that they did wait

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,277
kept them from their real life,

13
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:35,318
like their parents, and stuff.

14
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:36,928
- [Teacher] But saved their lives.

15
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:38,547
- [Girl in striped shirt] Yeah.

16
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:44,717
Okay. Emily and Simon. Simon?

17
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:45,517
- [Teacher] Emily.

18
00:00:45,517 --> 00:00:47,047
- [Girl in striped shirt] Emily and Spencer, I mean.

19
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,778
- [Boy in yellow] Simon? (laughs)

20
00:00:47,778 --> 00:00:50,508
- [Girl in striped shirt] That's her last name.

21
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,547
- [Boy in white] Do you believe the boys
were right for getting mad

22
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:57,997
at whatever his name is after
they got to the village,

23
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:00,497
and blaming him for missing?

24
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:02,708
- [Girl in blue] I think anyone would get mad.

25
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,015
They need to get it out on someone.

26
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:05,998
- [Boy in yellow] What do you mean by
being right to get mad?

27
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:07,678
- [Boy in white] Do they have, like...

28
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:08,658
- [Boy in yellow] A valid purpose?

29
00:01:08,658 --> 00:01:09,644
- [Boy in white] A valid reason for getting mad.

30
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:11,738
- [Boy in yellow] I mean, yeah.

31
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,577
- [Girl in blue] They were probably just
mad out of frustration.

32
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,518
- [Boy in yellow] If you would have went in
with them before, like earlier,

33
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:18,468
before the rebels attacked,
they wouldn't have been able

34
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:21,777
to see their families. So,
that's what their drive has been

35
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,067
for the past couple
months, or however long

36
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:26,472
they've been running. It's to
get back to their families.

37
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:28,208
Even if they would have
died, I mean. That's what he

38
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:32,958
was saying, is that he was
mad at him, at Dishmrael [sic]

39
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:37,958
for holding him back, because
he could have seen his family,

40
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:39,648
- [Boy in white] He would have died.

41
00:01:39,648 --> 00:01:41,747
- [Boy in yellow] But then, later on 
when his mind cooled down, he was like,

42
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,159
yeah well, he saved my life,

43
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,347
'cause I would have been killed.

44
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:45,947
- [Boy in white] It was probably 
like an in-the-moment thing.

45
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:48,317
- [Girl in blue] I think in that 
kind of situation, you always look

46
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,318
for someone to blame.

47
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,017
- [Girl in striped shirt] 'Cause there is 
no way he could have known soldiers

48
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:56,397
were gonna attack them, so we
should hurry, and go see them.

49
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:58,847
He thought they had time
to go and see their family.

50
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:01,297
Like, let's stop and
rest, and stuff like that.

51
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:03,818
There's no way he could have
known that was gonna happen,

52
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:07,607
so they can't really
blame him, but they need

53
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:08,507
to blame someone.

54
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,958
- [Girl in blue] Yeah.

55
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,037
- [Girl in striped shirt] I'd want 
to punch someone too.

56
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:14,197
- [Girl in blue] I'd be so mad if 
that happened to me. I understand

57
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:18,118
why they would blame him,
but looking back on it...

58
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:21,078
- [Teacher] And how does his age impact that, also?

59
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:22,038
- [Girl in blue] Well he's not...

60
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:24,027
- [Boy in white] He' not really 
old enough to really think about it.

61
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,557
- [Girl in blue] All he's thinking about is his family.

62
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:28,997
- [Girl in dark hoodie] With maturity, 
you think before you act,

63
00:02:28,997 --> 00:02:31,677
but as a little kid, you just act,

64
00:02:31,677 --> 00:02:34,497
and don't know the consequences.

65
00:02:34,497 --> 00:02:37,112
- [Teacher] Well, and he has no life
experience to prepare him

66
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:40,947
for this at all. There's another aspect.

67
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:43,157
- [Girl in striped shirt] And he used to 
follow Junior, and everything he did,

68
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:46,008
but now that Junior's gone,
he doesn't even have that.

69
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:51,008
- [Teacher] Right. Exactly. Okay, keep going.

70
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:55,477
- [Boy in yellow] War is hell.

71
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:57,847
- [Boy in black] Oh yeah, you can... 
Sorry about that.

72
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:01,517
- [Teacher] It's okay.

73
00:03:01,517 --> 00:03:03,313
- [Boy in black] So, want to go, Kaylee?

74
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,369
- [Kaylee] Okay.

75
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:05,448
- [Boy in gray] Ask the question.

76
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,707
- [Kaylee] The question: Girda is
a young woman at the time

77
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:10,907
of the book, and so was
Valentino and Wutuzuwut [sic].

78
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,477
How do they change through
the course of the book,

79
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,717
due to the tragic events in their lives.

80
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:20,717
- [Boy in black] I think they're 
forced to grow up real fast,

81
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:25,318
because of all the pressures.
At the time, I mean,

82
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,837
Valentino doesn't know
his age, but let's say,

83
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:30,998
like 15 and 20; and when,
I haven't read the end

84
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:33,517
of this book, but she
comes home to America,

85
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:36,357
and so does Valentino,
and they just come over;

86
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,958
and even though they're like
19, they're forced to be

87
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:43,257
like a 40-year-old. So,
it's kinda weird coming back

88
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,237
to America, and trying to
enjoy all the child pleasures.

89
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:48,757
- [Boy in gray] Yeah, the whole event 
just kinda makes them, you know,

90
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:52,078
kinda step it up a bit. If
something like this happens

91
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,537
to you, you don't easily
forget it. It becomes more

92
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,117
of a part of you.

93
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:59,627
It kinda takes out who
you really are inside.

94
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:00,797
- [Kaylee] Yeah, it shapes you.

95
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:01,697
- [Boy in gray] Yeah.

96
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,767
- [Teacher] Well, and how did the
stages in their life coincide.

97
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,197
That's a good question, Kaylee.

98
00:04:06,197 --> 00:04:09,759
- [Kaylee] Well, first of all, genocide,
I thought, was basically,

99
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,478
kind of done the same, so it
was usually like they lost

100
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:16,995
their families, they're
forced to go out on their own,

101
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,500
they're forced to make a
life for themselves. And both

102
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,500
of them kind of think, or know,
that their parents are dead.

103
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,907
And so, they kind of use their
families in a way to keep

104
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:31,717
them going, and just like
other people in their lives

105
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:35,162
that have motivated them,
'cause I think Ile [sic], or,

106
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:37,397
I don't know how to say her
name. She kind of motivated

107
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:41,318
Girda to kind of stay in the
camp with her, and have maybe

108
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:45,547
a friend there, where with
Abek's [sic] family, she wouldn't

109
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:48,467
really have a friend, she'd
just have, like she'd owe it

110
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,395
to their family to do things for them.

111
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:55,395
And then with Achek [sic], he
had William K. to help him--

112
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:57,997
- [Boy in gray] Just had a friend to make it through.

113
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:58,997
- [Kaylee] Yeah.

114
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,327
- [Teacher] So they both had a 
strong friend. What kind of life

115
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:04,671
did they both live before disaster struck?

116
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,808
- [Boy in gray] They both had the 
perfect, ideal family life, you know.

117
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,437
They were happy. They were all
together. It was, you know,

118
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:12,728
like what would happen in a
Disney movie, pretty much.

119
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:16,507
Everything's kinda perfect.
And then, something happens

120
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:19,168
in the first. Both, in the
person that happens to meet,

121
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,117
their family ties are cut.
And their survival depends

122
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,708
on whether they can kinda
ban together with the people

123
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:29,917
around them, and kinda
grow, and become stronger.

124
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:31,637
- [Kaylee] Yeah. I think...

125
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:32,597
- [Boy in black] Yeah.

126
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,118
- [Kaylee] No, you go.

127
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:37,997
- [Boy in black] Okay. They were just, 
I mean, they were forced to grow up.

128
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:41,878
And they just lived, like Ryan
said, like the ideal life,

129
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,757
with their family, or whatever.
But once their parents left,

130
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,757
they had to find a friend,
or someone to group with,

131
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:49,477
in order to--

132
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,637
- [Teacher] Well, what were they 
replacing? What were they replacing,

133
00:05:51,637 --> 00:05:54,438
with William K and Ile [sic]?

134
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,038
- [Kaylee] Yeah. They established a family

135
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,307
without being blood related.

136
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,007
- [Boy in black] They just had 
to make it through by that.

137
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,661
It's 'cause if you don't have
motivation, then you're not

138
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:06,242
going to get through
things, so even though

139
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,998
they didn't know that
their... I mean, they assumed

140
00:06:08,998 --> 00:06:11,757
their parents were dead, but
they didn't know for sure.

141
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:14,507
'Cause on page 80 of this, I
mean, she said that she never

142
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:19,487
saw her father again. But,
just to know that their parents

143
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,438
are alive, and they just
want to regroup with them

144
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:26,107
at the end keeps them motivated and alive.

145
00:06:26,107 --> 00:06:27,957
- [Teacher] Not knowing. They 
both have that in common.

146
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:28,497
- [Boy in black] Right.

147
00:06:28,497 --> 00:06:30,309
- [Teacher] Assuming that they're dead, 
but not really knowing for sure.

148
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,017
- [Boy in black] Just to keep them 
motivated to survive,

149
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,448
so it's a good tactic.

150
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:35,157
- [Teacher] So what is a really 
simple message that we can take

151
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:40,157
from that, from both of their stories?

152
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:43,017
What do you need in your life?

153
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:43,877
- [Boy in black] Motivation.

154
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:47,317
- [Kaylee] You need family. You need
some kind of family unit to...

155
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,278
- [Boy in black] Survive. Or friends.

156
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,597
- [Boy in gray] Everyone needs like
someone to kinda like go to,

157
00:06:51,597 --> 00:06:54,136
and they can depend on, no
matter what the situation is.

158
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:56,038
- [Boy in black] Right, and if you're 
going to friends a lot of time,

159
00:06:56,038 --> 00:06:59,004
at least in like a high
school, or whatever;

160
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:01,798
you go to friends with questions,
instead of your family,

161
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:05,317
or whatever, sometimes you'll
get the wrong side of view

162
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:08,717
on things, and it will
change your life drastically.

163
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:10,437
'Cause your friends determine
how your high school

164
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,457
is gonna be, determines how
the rest of your life...

165
00:07:12,457 --> 00:07:13,988
- [Boy in gray] But also, you 
got a different perspective,

166
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:16,317
'cause your family doesn't
necessarily know what's going on

167
00:07:16,317 --> 00:07:17,957
in your own high school.

168
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:20,878
- [Boy in black] Yeah, so it's 
good to get both, but family

169
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:23,157
is more important 'cause you
can count on them more usually.

170
00:07:23,157 --> 00:07:26,468
- [Kaylee] And they're older and
wiser. You need that

171
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:29,838
kind of like wise person, 'cause
my mom knows more than I do

172
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:32,037
or my friends.

173
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:32,627
- [Boy in black] Yeah.

174
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,277
- [Teacher] But you need those 
relationships as connections, right?

175
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,037
- [Boy in black] Right, to keep motivated.

176
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,537
- [Teacher] Both of those stories show that really,

177
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:39,977
literally life and death
situations; those connections

178
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,117
with other humans. It is a
human basic need that we have

179
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:46,557
to make those connections.
Or you cannot survive.

180
00:07:46,557 --> 00:07:48,729
I think both of those
stories... That's a really

181
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,417
good question, in looking
at the stages. It also shows

182
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:56,417
globally... Globally, what
can we say about families?

183
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,197
At the beginning of the
story... you were talking about,

184
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:01,238
it's like a Disney movie, right?

185
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:02,238
- [Boy in gray] Yeah.

186
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,557
- [Teacher] So what can we say about families

187
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:04,719
literally around the world?

188
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,878
- [Kaylee] They're all usually
together. Nobody ever leaves

189
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,718
their children when their
toddlers to go find where,

190
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:13,098
like how they're supposed
to live, and like,

191
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:15,957
what's good and bad. You
usually nurture your kids 'til

192
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:20,237
they're about nineteen, and
then they go off to college.

193
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:23,777
I think that's just how it
is everywhere. It may not be

194
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:26,917
that way in some places, but
you usually have schooling,

195
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,317
and then you go off, and then
you figure out for yourself,

196
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:30,637
once you've got a base.

197
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,677
- [Boy in black] Yeah, they're 
usually pretty perfect or ideal,

198
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:36,917
until like a third party, like
Nazis or the Arabians come in

199
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:41,678
and just wipe that out, and
changes a lot drastically

200
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:44,327
to where they have to depend
on themselves, and I guess

201
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:46,717
their friends, since
they didn't have family.

202
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:49,279
- [Teacher] And that family unit
seems to lend to safety,

203
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,448
even if you're living in 
Sudan or if you're living

204
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,837
in Poland. The children
both at the beginning

205
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,628
feel very safe in their lives, right?

206
00:08:58,628 --> 00:08:59,387
- [Boy in black] Right.

207
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:02,737
- [Kaylee] And if nobody knows you,
what makes you... if you die

208
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,877
who would care? That's what I
would think. Like, if nobody

209
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,957
cared about me, or nobody knew who I was.

210
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:08,757
- [Boy in black] That's, what, 
a lot of suicidal thoughts...

211
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,810
- [Kaylee] Yeah.

212
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,458
- [Boys](laughter)

213
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,157
- [Kaylee] I was just thinking. 
I don't think that, but I'm

214
00:09:12,157 --> 00:09:16,248
just saying, if I had nobody
to be like I care about you.

215
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:19,117
You need to stay alive,
or like your parents.

216
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,638
There wouldn't be a reason to live.

217
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,330
- [boy in black] Yeah, but like 
in those stories, like they find

218
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,237
symbolic fixtures, or whatever.
I think in both, yeah,

219
00:09:28,237 --> 00:09:33,117
the moon. They look at the moon
and they see, they just see

220
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,148
the moon, and it's like their
kinda friend. But they also

221
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,439
hope that the moon will find
their parents somewhere,

222
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,407
or wherever they are,
'cause they don't know.

223
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,098
- [Boy in gray] Yeah, their parents 
are looking at the same thing

224
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,156
that they're seeing, kinda.

225
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,197
- [Boy in black] Yeah, so it's 
kinda like, right there,

226
00:09:43,197 --> 00:09:44,317
keeping them together.

227
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,708
- [Teacher] And what's funny, 
is that's a main... the moon

228
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,818
is a main symbol in a long way gone.

229
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:49,447
- [Boy in black] Yeah.

230
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:51,138
- [Teacher] And he refers to that also.

231
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:55,027
- [Kaylee] I think 'cause the moon can
be seen anywhere on earth.

232
00:09:55,027 --> 00:10:00,027
It's a connection, I
think, somewhere. Yeah.

233
00:10:00,637 --> 00:10:02,077
- [Boy in black] Yeah, totally.

234
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:06,397
- [Boy in gray] It's kinda like the 
bright light in darkness. You know,

235
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,237
the night, it's a pictch
black, but the moon's shining.

236
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:10,978
You know, kinda there no matter what.

237
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:15,978
Good. Okay, keep going.

238
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:19,027
- [Boy in hoodie] And the German's 
are just coming in,

239
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,967
and everything's getting really bad.

240
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,509
And like going back to their
past, and showing it as such

241
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,318
a nice place. What she does,
is she ends up showing how much

242
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:32,318
darker it is by comparison.

243
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:37,218
- [Teacher] Okay, what was the question?

244
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:41,077
- [Boy in black] How does the author 
implement setting to contrast,

245
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:43,791
good and evil? How is it affected?

246
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,317
- [Teacher] Okay.

247
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:48,397
- [Boy in black] ...purpose. And we just
finished talking about how

248
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:52,158
it shows the atrocities to be even darker,

249
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:55,317
because it's happening in this nice place.

250
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:59,117
- [Girl in yellow] But she's forced 
to saying the dark side of things,

251
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,917
'cause she's forced into her
basement, where it's all dark,

252
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:04,757
and you know, there's mildew
on the wall, and it's flooded,

253
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:07,537
and it's just really gross
down there. And that's what's

254
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:11,528
happening outside of the
happy little hometown that she

255
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:16,528
grew up in. And then, her
childhood is marked with flowers

256
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:21,637
and the sunny days. You know,
running with her friends,

257
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:25,477
and chasing butterflies, and
eating sweets. And it's just

258
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,557
really happy, and bright,
and cheery. And so,

259
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:32,417
there's a major contrast.

260
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:36,237
- [Teacher] And, as you go into the 
book, does that darkness continue?

261
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,477
Or is it broken by light?
How does she portray darkness

262
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:43,499
and light even when she goes to the camps?

263
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:44,837
- [Boy in hoodie] There's...

264
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,468
- [Boy in black] Go ahead, but I have an answer.

265
00:11:46,468 --> 00:11:48,877
- [Teacher] OK. (laughs)

266
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:52,788
- [Boy in hoodie] At least up to the point
where we've read, she's kind of

267
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,837
reached a climax of how bad
things are when her parents

268
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:59,007
were taken away from her and
everything. Arthur's letters

269
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,357
stopped coming. And that's
kind of the climax from how far

270
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:06,957
we've gotten, where the
darkness is. So now it's about

271
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:10,167
finding the good things
that are in that darkness.

272
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,919
- [Girl in glasses] Right. I think she has
little flashes of good things,

273
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,919
and the smallest of things to
us brings such hope to her,

274
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:22,758
of a bright future. But it
is surrounded by darkness.

275
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:24,848
- [Teacher] And in the camp, did
she talk about physically

276
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:27,217
light and dark also?

277
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:29,697
- [Boy in black] Like the dramas, 
and she wrote plays;

278
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:30,977
And they had fun there.

279
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:35,977
- [Girl in glasses] The single light
shining in the dark room .

280
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:41,767
- [Teacher] Do you have anything to add, Abbey?

281
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:46,037
Can you think of times
when she talked about light?

282
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:51,037
Physically, light in the
camps? I was trying to think.

283
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:54,887
And how does she portray it?
'Cause that is an interesting

284
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:59,887
motif in the book, the light and dark.

285
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:02,847
And it will continue to play a part.

286
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,768
Which camp is she in at the middle part?

287
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:14,768
- [Boy in black] She's in the, I can't
pronounce it. It's the first one,

288
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:20,917
where she's, they're
sewing, they're weaving.

289
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,157
- [Teacher] So they're at the looms, right?

290
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:27,477
- [Girl in yelow] Yeah, they're at the looms.

291
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,148
- [Boy in hoodie] Did she pass 
through Auschwitz?

292
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:43,339
Or was that the one, she was in jail?

293
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,339
I think she passed
through Volkenheim [sic]?

294
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:56,478
- [Teacher] Yeah. Does she ever get
outside? That would be a key,

295
00:13:56,478 --> 00:14:00,387
at Volkenheim [sic].

296
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:01,357
- [Boy in black] Outside of the camp itself?

297
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:03,598
- [Teacher] Just outside, in the outside.

298
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:06,767
- [Girl in yellow] Well, here's a 
reference to outside. She talks about how

299
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:10,008
the night was starry and
beautiful. "From Heirgonk [sic] I

300
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:12,428
could see the hill through a
window. Slowly, the full moon

301
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:17,428
rose..." So that is like a light
in the darkness, literally.

302
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:24,427
Because the stars... the
moon and the stars are

303
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:27,967
the brightest things at night
in the sky, and just, her

304
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,798
finding that comfort in that,
also shows really extreme

305
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:34,357
light and dark.

306
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:37,437
- [Teacher] But her comfort comes
at night, in the darkness.

307
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:39,638
And she has one source of
light. So keep looking for those

308
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,918
motifs of light and dark 'cause
they play a part throughout.

309
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:45,217
Have any of you gotten
past the halfway point?

310
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,517
- [Girl in glasses] Yeah.

311
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:49,037
- [Girl in yellow] Yeah, we've gotten 
a little bit past.

312
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,798
- [Teacher] In the march, you know
that becomes very important.

313
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:55,717
Alright, good. Good job.

314
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:58,278
Alright, you guys! Bell's gonna ring.

315
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:03,278
Keep your questions for tomorrow
