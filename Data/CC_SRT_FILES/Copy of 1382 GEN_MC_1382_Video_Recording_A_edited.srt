1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:00,883
(children chatter)

2
00:00:00,883 --> 00:00:01,716
- About 33.

3
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:04,073
- 33, so 150 plus 33?

4
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,210
- 180.

5
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,043
- What'd you get?

6
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:06,882
- 180.

7
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:07,950
- 180, so is that...

8
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,117
Did we double?

9
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:11,560
- Went a little higher.

10
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,582
- Went a little higher.

11
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:14,289
So you guys made a good
prediction, didn't you?

12
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:17,172
All right, keep doing
your trials, nice work.

13
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:18,131
Heads up, Madison.

14
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:19,214
Heads up. Ah!

15
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,031
- Can you stop it?

16
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,196
- No, you're good.

17
00:00:22,196 --> 00:00:24,448
All right, so what have
you guys found out so far?

18
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:28,320
- We've been increasing,
but then we just...

19
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,624
It increased a little,
but I think we're gonna

20
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:31,731
increase a little more.

21
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,479
- Okay, so you're measuring...

22
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,237
You've all, you've raised your ramp to 10?

23
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:36,070
- Yes.

24
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,903
- All right.

25
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:39,820
(children chatter)

26
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
- All right.

27
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:47,312
Now, what was your prediction?

28
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:49,935
It would go farther based on height?

29
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:51,693
- Because, like, from all the other

30
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:53,248
experiments that we've done...

31
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,081
- Uh-huh.

32
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:55,802
- It's gone farther, so...

33
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:59,469
And it has more force
if the ramp is higher.

34
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:01,690
- Okay.

35
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,337
Man, that ambulance, that thing moves.

36
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:07,770
All right, what did you guys get, Mary Robin,

37
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,270
when you measured?

38
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,015
- We got 179.

39
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:14,871
- 179, okay.

40
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:18,028
- What was weird is that...

41
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,374
Like, what's weird is
that on the first trial,

42
00:01:21,374 --> 00:01:23,580
we got 130, and then we went to,

43
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,018
like, the, like 50s and things.

44
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:26,851
- Okay.

45
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,083
- And then we went back
to like the 80s and 90s.

46
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,592
- Yeah.

47
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,916
All right, so now we need to go ahead

48
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,890
and do what?

49
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,073
You've done your three
trials, what's the next?

50
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,165
- Average.
- Average.

51
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,860
- All right, let's see.

52
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,943
We got 182, 172, and 179.

53
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:45,839
(children chatter)

54
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,214
- 533.

55
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:51,374
- 533, and then
what are you going to do?

56
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,045
- Divide it by three.

57
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,182
- Okay, divide by three.

58
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,265
- 177.666667.

59
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,101
- So we can round that up to?

60
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:02,945
- To 178.

61
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:05,407
- 178.
Is that pretty close?

62
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,055
So you got...

63
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:10,352
Your trials are pretty
close together. 182--

64
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,140
- 172 and 179.

65
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,438
- So you predicted that it would increase

66
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:16,738
by raising the ramp.

67
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:17,992
Was that true?

68
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:18,825
- Yes.

69
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:19,658
- So your prediction came true.

70
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,312
Let's turn over the back side,

71
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,819
and let's finish the
rest of that lab part.

72
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,049
- So were there any trials

73
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,549
that your team did not record?

74
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,250
We only did it...

75
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,572
We didn't do that one
because it flipped off.

76
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,894
- It, like, hit this chip card

77
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:37,473
and it just, like, went whoo!

78
00:02:37,473 --> 00:02:38,495
- It went like...

79
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:39,888
- All right, that's a
good one not to include.

80
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,094
Let's write that down.

81
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,485
We didn't include one
because it hit a chip hard.

82
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:45,318
- Yeah.

83
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:46,808
- Yeah, that's good.

84
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:47,783
- It just
like flew off to the side

85
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,339
and it went all the way, like...

86
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,360
- Did it really?

87
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,614
- Yeah, it just...

88
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:52,497
- That's crazy.

89
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:53,332
- It was funny because...

90
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,586
It was also funny because
it was going straight,

91
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:55,655
but then it just...

92
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:56,488
- That's weird.

93
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,321
- Turned.

94
00:02:57,321 --> 00:02:58,277
- That's weird that it hit that...

95
00:02:58,277 --> 00:03:01,413
That that caused it to,
you know, make such a turn.

96
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,920
- But then, like,
(mumbles).

97
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,263
The whole time it's been
going to the, the right side.

98
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:09,180
- Oh, okay.

99
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:11,699
So it's been curving?

100
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,580
- Yeah, it kind of like tilted, and...

101
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,765
- That's a good idea.

102
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:16,692
Yeah, that's a real good idea.

103
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:18,920
- Okay, so, question two.

104
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,428
What was the average
distance the Jeep rolled

105
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:24,095
with the five-centimeter height?

106
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:27,176
So the five-centimeter height.

107
00:03:27,176 --> 00:03:29,104
- On the back side of that.

108
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:32,308
- We got an average of 30, 93.

109
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:35,975
- 93, all right, so
write that one down, 93.

110
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,110
Did that surprise you, it would go 93?

111
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

112
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,361
- Is that farther,
that's what you thought?

113
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,661
- I never thought

114
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:47,099
we'd actually get to the end of it.

115
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,074
- Yeah, that's a--

116
00:03:48,074 --> 00:03:49,189
- But then we actually did

117
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:50,698
with those little toy cars.

118
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:51,531
- Yeah.

119
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,364
- And this is actually

120
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:54,460
an older-looking toy car.

121
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,293
- Yeah.

122
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,248
- Because
whenever I roll one wheel,

123
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:57,966
the other wheel rolls just a little.

124
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,406
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

125
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,472
So you thought maybe the wheels would have

126
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:02,516
something to do with it?

127
00:04:02,516 --> 00:04:03,561
- Yeah.
- Okay.

128
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:04,491
- But I never thought

129
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,689
it would actually go that far.

130
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,522
- Okay.

131
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:09,823
So you're now on number three, right?

132
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:12,657
- What was the average
distance the Jeep rolled

133
00:04:12,657 --> 00:04:16,620
(mumbles) 10-centimeter height?

134
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,027
That was 178.

135
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:18,860
- Okay.

136
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:21,531
So, 178.

137
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,089
It looks like the next question is,

138
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:27,521
did the Jeep roll shorter
or longer distance?

139
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,354
- Longer.

140
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,187
- Longer.

141
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:32,104
Can we figure out how much farther?

142
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,189
- Yes.

143
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:35,912
- What would we have to do?

144
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:38,072
- The 10-centimeter average

145
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:40,997
minus the 5-centimeter average,

146
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:44,271
and then your answer would be how...

147
00:04:44,271 --> 00:04:46,245
Like, the distance between.

148
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,499
- Well, why don't you do that?

149
00:04:47,499 --> 00:04:48,698
Why don't you pull that up?

150
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:49,531
The 178...

151
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:55,934
(boy mumbles)

152
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,309
You know, it's always better

153
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,211
when you can incorporate
those into your answers.

154
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,066
You know, it increased by one...

155
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:07,133
Or it was 85 higher.

156
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:09,479
It's always better when you
can show your answer with data.

157
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,151
When you can increase that

158
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,682
it makes your answer
seem more valid, right?

159
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:15,028
All right, so maybe can include that,

160
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,320
and then move on to
that number five there.

161
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,179
Okay? All right.

162
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:21,290
You guys are doing a great job.

163
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,777
Hey, have you guys gone through

164
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,469
everything you needed
to do on the front side?

165
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:28,117
Did you read all these first?

166
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:32,518
You gotta read this whole
section of your lab first, okay?

167
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:35,954
Yeah, so I would read this part first

168
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,603
and then move on, okay?

169
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,436
All right.

170
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:40,784
(children chatter)

171
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:42,827
All right, how you guys doing?

172
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:43,660
- Good.

173
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,357
- All right,
so you guys have done

174
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,888
your first trial on this one.

175
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,908
Now, did you do this one here?

176
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:52,765
- I don't...

177
00:05:52,765 --> 00:05:54,902
- Let's look at our directions.

178
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:58,173
It says change the ramp back
to five centimeters high.

179
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,055
Did you do that?

180
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:00,193
- No, sir.

181
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,242
- Okay, let's do that.

182
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,075
All right.

183
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,228
- Sandpaper?

184
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,458
- And then I think it...

185
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,549
Doesn't it say...

186
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:07,665
- It says tile floor.

187
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:08,570
- It says tile floor,

188
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,102
so we're going to measure on the tile.

189
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:10,935
(girl mumbles)

190
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,518
- I get to race it.

191
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,907
- All right, are we ready?

192
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:18,369
Now I'm going to move over here.

193
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,598
Now, what vehicle we got here?

194
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,456
- You should move over there because

195
00:06:22,456 --> 00:06:23,315
it always goes over here.

196
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,592
- Oh, it always moves over here?

197
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,799
- Yeah.

198
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,309
- It has a curve?

199
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:28,142
- Yeah.

200
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:29,468
- How about if I move back over here?

201
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:30,513
Will that work?

202
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:31,790
All right, you ready?

203
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,623
- Right here?

204
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,902
- Yeah, that's good.

205
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:35,970
Oh, you're right.

206
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,553
Good thing I moved.

207
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:41,804
- I'll hold it down. Hold that down.

208
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:43,754
- Now, in your first experiment, Annie,

209
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:45,218
while they're doing this,

210
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:46,379
what did it?

211
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,469
When you increased the height of the ramp,

212
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:49,302
did it increase?

213
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:50,512
- Yeah, it went faster.

214
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:51,557
- It went what?

215
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:53,734
- It went faster because
it had more force.

216
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,499
- Okay, so it had more force.

217
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,751
(children chatter)

218
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,700
So why do you guys think
by increasing the height

219
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,926
of the ramp on the first
lab, it had more force?

220
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:04,759
All right.

221
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,751
- It's more steeper.

222
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,584
- Okay.

223
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:08,119
- And the more steeper it is, the more,

224
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,929
less friction it would
cause, so it could go faster.

225
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:11,974
- Okay.

226
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,226
What was the force that was
bringing it down the ramp?

227
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,059
- Gravity.

228
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,892
- Gravity.

229
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:19,636
So you can you conclude
from your model experiment

230
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:22,864
that when you increase
the steepness of the ramp,

231
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,836
the pull of gravity is greater?

232
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:28,320
- Yeah, because it's going more (mumbles).

233
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,667
- Okay, all right.

234
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:33,104
- It's going down, going faster.

235
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:33,937
- Okay.

236
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:38,341
- And then when it gets,
if it gets down safely,

237
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:41,085
it'll just go farther
because it has more speed.

238
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,177
- Okay. Great.

239
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,895
All right, so we're on
trial two, aren't we?

240
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:44,728
- Yes.

241
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:45,562
- Let's do it.

242
00:07:45,562 --> 00:07:46,395
- Go!

243
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,856
- You do have that, it
does have that curved roll.

244
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,435
- Oh, it landed on the--

245
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:53,827
- On the back of it.

246
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:56,056
- There's like a cargo of
some sort in the back of it.

247
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,636
- Is it, is there a--

248
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,843
- There's cargo in the...

249
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,051
- 113.

250
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,444
- Wait, wait, hold on.

251
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:02,582
Let's double check.

252
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:06,582
What I would do, maybe,
is bring your Jeep over.

253
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,543
- Yeah, but then it's--

254
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:09,448
- 106.

255
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,399
- No, but then it's...

256
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,232
- Oh, you're on the...

257
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,065
Are you going to the front?

258
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:12,898
- Yeah.

259
00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:14,323
- Okay, 113, yeah, you're right.

260
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,136
- No, but then you're going at an angle.

261
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,413
- And you don't let it go.

262
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,478
- Yeah, I mean, either way, I
think you're going to get a...

263
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:21,311
As long as you--

264
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,078
- That's the way we're doing it from here.

265
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:24,495
- Well, you know, as long as you do

266
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,886
the same thing every time,

267
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:28,187
then you should be consistent, right?

268
00:08:28,187 --> 00:08:29,020
- Yeah.

269
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,853
- All right, one more roll, right?

270
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:30,686
- One more.

271
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:32,599
- And then we have it, yeah.

272
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:33,876
- One more roll, Jordan.

273
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:34,990
Here we go.

274
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,965
- Then we have to add them all up.

275
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:36,798
- Dun, dun, dun,

276
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:37,868
dun, dun, dun,

277
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:39,535
dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!

278
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,518
Dun, dun,

279
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:42,401
dun, dun, dun.

280
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,234
- The only thing is that...

281
00:08:43,234 --> 00:08:44,816
Is that farther?

282
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,649
Don't you think it's farther?

283
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:46,720
Are we ready?

284
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,366
- Maybe it's because of me.

285
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:51,448
- Do you think you have
anything to do with it?

286
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,281
- Yeah.

287
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,448
- You do, huh?

288
00:08:54,396 --> 00:08:55,229
- Go!

289
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:57,668
- Fire!

290
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:01,688
(children chatter)

291
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,452
- 117.

292
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:04,285
- How far?

293
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:05,147
- 117.

294
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,425
- 117, all right.

295
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,609
- 117.

296
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:08,445
- So now, wait.

297
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,526
Now Thiago, the math whiz,
has to do his math.

298
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,430
- All right, so how do you
find the average again?

299
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,213
- We do...

300
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:15,046
We do...

301
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,699
We add them all up, and then we divide it

302
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,216
by the number of times you rolled it.

303
00:09:20,216 --> 00:09:21,448
- Okay, let's do it.

304
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:22,281
- So we
rolled it three times.

305
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,094
- You ready?
Let's find our average.

306
00:09:24,094 --> 00:09:25,511
- Pencil, please!

307
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,738
- Oh, you guys aren't
even using a calculator.

308
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:31,315
- No, we haven't been.

309
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,245
- We only use it for the division.

310
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,336
- Oh, you only use it for the division.

311
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:34,474
Hey, I like that.

312
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,704
- Sometimes, sometimes.

313
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,354
Sometimes we still need it.

314
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:39,095
- What do you guys got?
- 10.

315
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,419
- That's zero.

316
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:41,626
- 10.

317
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:44,249
- To zero, add up the...

318
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,457
- Four, and three.

319
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:47,407
- So 340.

320
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:49,325
- So you're going to take 340,

321
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,255
and then you're going to divide it.

322
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,973
- Divided by three.

323
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:53,645
- And Thiago can usually do that.

324
00:09:53,645 --> 00:09:55,478
- You get 113.3333333.

325
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,092
- All right, well, check
it out on a calculator,

326
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:04,925
just to make sure.

327
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:05,996
- Okay.

328
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:07,457
- How can you do that in your
head without a calculator?

329
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:09,153
- I don't know.

330
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:10,314
- Yeah, but how do you do that?

331
00:10:10,314 --> 00:10:12,335
What did you say the number was, Thiago?

332
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:13,918
- It was 113.33333.

333
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,651
- All right, here we go.

334
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,959
- It's 113, come on, Thiago.

335
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,919
(children chatter)

336
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,252
- 113.333333333.

337
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,730
He got it.

338
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,263
All right, nice job, man.

339
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:29,888
All right, so 113.

340
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:31,373
Is that pretty consistent, though?

341
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:32,206
- Yeah.

342
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:33,277
- Yeah, because we had a 113.

343
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:34,110
- Yeah, you did.

344
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,460
And that was your middle score, wasn't it?

345
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,622
- Yeah.

346
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,339
- And really, if you take the thing--

347
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,222
- And then we gotta do this one.

348
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,545
- No, never mind.

349
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:43,236
I think if you take four
here and you put it here...

350
00:10:43,236 --> 00:10:44,654
- Yeah, if you take
three here, put it here,

351
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,883
then you have one more here.

352
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:47,716
- Yep. All right.

353
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:48,973
So now what we're going to do,

354
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:51,806
it says to add sandpaper
to the bottom of the ramp.

355
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:52,803
- Which we did.

356
00:10:52,803 --> 00:10:55,667
- And predict whether it's going to go.

357
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,812
We'll have to redo those, won't we?

358
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:58,645
- Yeah.

359
00:10:58,645 --> 00:10:59,554
- So let's erase those,

360
00:10:59,554 --> 00:11:02,171
because you had the ramp at how high?

361
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,004
- 10 centimeters.

362
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:04,305
- 10, and we needed to...

363
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,350
We need to have an equal trial.

364
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,068
We need to have it at
the same distance, right?

365
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:08,415
- Yeah.

366
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,693
- So the question is...

367
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:10,854
Sit up for me, Jordan.

368
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:12,455
I know we got a lot of space here.

369
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:13,733
What are we going to...

370
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,566
Do you think it's gonna go shorter

371
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,170
or a farther distance?

372
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,027
- It's gonna go shorter.

373
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:19,860
- Why?

374
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,035
- Because there's more friction.

375
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:23,636
Sandpaper's rough, so it
creates more friction.

376
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:24,469
- Okay.

377
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:25,958
- Slow down the thing.

378
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,282
- Okay, what do you think?

379
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:28,303
- When it slows it down,

380
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:30,927
it may slow it down and then it says,

381
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:33,689
the car starts to turn, just because...

382
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:36,241
Just because it's our car, goes out to the side,

383
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:37,888
so it goes more to the side.

384
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:38,721
- All right.

385
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:39,554
- Than it usually does.

386
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:40,387
- What do you guys think?

387
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,220
Farther or shorter?

388
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,303
- I think it'll go shorter because...

389
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:46,954
The gravity may be pulling it down,

390
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,852
but the sandpaper is really
rough like Thiago said,

391
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:53,544
and it would, like, stop it
to make it not move anymore.

392
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,564
It would, like barely get off the paper.

393
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:56,887
- Okay, can you guys, like...

394
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,304
Say you're riding your bike.

395
00:11:58,304 --> 00:12:00,928
And you ride your bike on smooth pavement,

396
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,948
and then you ride it on a rough surface.

397
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:06,531
Is it easier to ride on
the smooth or the rough?

398
00:12:06,531 --> 00:12:07,364
- Smooth.

399
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:08,469
- The smooth, right?

400
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:11,117
So can we use that to help
us make our prediction?

401
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:13,484
- It actually could be
faster on the bumps more,

402
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,925
because if you hit a bump...

403
00:12:14,925 --> 00:12:18,013
If you're going fast enough
and you hit a big enough bump,

404
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,569
you could actually go in the air.

405
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:21,008
- Okay, maybe.

406
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,702
All right, let's go and
test this thing out,

407
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:24,212
and see if you guys are right.

408
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,792
Annie, while we're setting up this lab,

409
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,555
can you go ahead and
write your prediction?

410
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:32,270
And it looks like you need to
grab your sandpaper there.

411
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,290
Now, I can't sit here, can I?

412
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,451
This is the bad seat.

413
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:36,728
I gotta move.

414
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:38,168
- Well, I say you sit--

415
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,001
- It doesn't go very far

416
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,327
anymore on the sandpaper.

417
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,488
- All right, well, let's set it up there.

418
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:42,742
That one there, right?

419
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:43,764
And that one there?

420
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,762
- Four centimeters more.

421
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:46,202
- All right, let's look.

422
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,202
We went 113.

423
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:52,007
With the sandpaper, how far
do you think it's gonna go?

424
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,562
Let's make a prediction.

425
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:56,209
- I think
it'll go maybe half that,

426
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,626
or even less than half that.

427
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,901
- Okay, so what would half of 113 be?

428
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:01,179
What's that close to?

429
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:02,012
- I don't know.

430
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:04,512
I think that would be maybe...

431
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,285
500 and...

432
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,284
- 500?

433
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:09,117
- 500 and...

434
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:10,188
- No, you want half of it.

435
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,813
- Oh, five, okay.

436
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:12,858
Half of it.

437
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:13,691
- 50.

438
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:14,693
- I think, there you go, 50, yeah.

439
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:15,526
- 50.

440
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:16,359
- All right.

441
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,192
- 52...

442
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,250
- 51 point (mumbles).

443
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,528
- 50 point, like...

444
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:23,754
50.5 or something.

445
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:24,587
- Okay.

446
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,933
All right, are we ready
for the first roll?

447
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:28,766
Let's do it.

448
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,557
Let's get our first trial.

449
00:13:30,557 --> 00:13:32,557
Here we go. We're ready.

450
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:36,152
- Wait, who hasn't rolled?

451
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:37,824
- Has Emma not rolled?

452
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:38,799
Okay, all right, good.

453
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,703
I like the way your group's
working together there.

454
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:41,536
- All right.

455
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:42,909
- Here we go.

456
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:43,742
Oh.

457
00:13:43,742 --> 00:13:44,883
Should we use that trial,

458
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:45,997
or should we try a different one?

459
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:46,830
- Try again.

460
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,663
- Let's try one more.

461
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,496
Maybe we can get that--

462
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,665
- Well, scoot it right over here.

463
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:53,590
- And we could even scoot
the sandpaper, like, there.

464
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,423
- Yeah.

465
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,307
- All right, you ready?

466
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:57,863
All right, there it is.

467
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,326
- It didn't even
move off the sandpaper.

468
00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,208
- Let's give it...

469
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,041
- Can someone hold that down?

470
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,946
Can someone hold that down, please?

471
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,433
- Here we go.

472
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,315
This is our test.

473
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:08,010
Is the prediction right?

474
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,148
- The sandpaper's hard.

475
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,634
- It is, it's rough, isn't it?

476
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:11,467
- Yeah.

477
00:14:14,558 --> 00:14:15,395
- 49.

478
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:16,926
- Now, aren't you on the front?

479
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:19,039
- Yeah, which would be a 49.

480
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,015
- Yeah, but you mean...

481
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,058
Or maybe you're (mumbles) about 50?

482
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:23,196
- Yeah, about 50.

483
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,032
- You guys were pretty close

484
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:25,029
in your prediction, weren't you?

485
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,261
Half.

486
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,165
- It was like 50.

487
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,999
- Yeah, Jordan said 50 1/2.

488
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,159
- All right, you guys got
two more trials, right?

489
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,923
- I said 51 1/2.

490
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,200
You said 51 1/2.

491
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,733
- All right, ready?

492
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:37,566
- Yeah.

493
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:40,074
Oh, man.

494
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:41,702
- Really?

495
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:42,910
- Let's like keep it down.

496
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,581
- Or maybe we'll hold
it down next time, yeah.

497
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,998
- Yeah, I think that's the problem.

498
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,581
It's scooting back.

499
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,265
- That was 50...

500
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,240
- 47.

501
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,471
- Yeah, 47.

502
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:56,304
- Okay.

503
00:14:56,304 --> 00:14:57,212
- Almost in half.

504
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:58,931
- All right, I'll hold it on this side.

505
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,080
Are we ready?

506
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,913
Here we go.
