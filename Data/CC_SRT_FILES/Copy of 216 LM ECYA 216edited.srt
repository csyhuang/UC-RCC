00:00:01,557 --> 00:00:04,118
- Hi, welcome to the library 
media center.

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:08,558
At the entrance, we post school community
events and have some newspapers

3
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,118
so that our readers can keep up with the

4
00:00:10,118 --> 00:00:12,518
current news and community happenings.

5
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:15,391
At our situation desk we
have a suggestion box,

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,997
our series list, and magazines 
and books to

7
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,438
entice students as they check out.

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,357
In our commercial seating
area we have state book award

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,637
nominees and winners, as well 
as numerous magazines for

10
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:29,238
you in the library for your checkout.

11
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,750
For the teachers, I have a
professional library with over

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,198
3,000 books, DVDs, manipulatives
and kits,

13
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,397
developed to support the curriculum.

14
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:40,318
Fiction is concentrated on
the right side of the library.

15
00:00:40,318 --> 00:00:42,439
The paperbacks, a student favorite,

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:45,557
arranged by genre just
like in retail stores.

17
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:48,357
All of the series books are
clearly labelled so students can

18
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,917
quickly find the next book in a series.

19
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,117
I give special consideration
to my reluctant reader's needs

20
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:56,509
if students interests
were looking for fiction,

21
00:00:56,509 --> 00:00:58,837
or making sure we have quality literature

22
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:00,477
for all reading levels.

23
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,238
We have 13 desktop computers,
and a mobile laptop lab

24
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:06,437
with which students access the internet,

25
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:10,197
numerous databases, Impact,
and a variety of software.

26
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:13,201
On the school library website,
they find reviews, 

27
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:15,797
blogs, links to resarch sites, 
as well as

28
00:01:15,797 --> 00:01:18,368
book suggestions, trainers, and podcasts,

29
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:20,997
many of which are created by the students.

30
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,277
On the left-hand side of the library,

31
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:26,395
the reference and the
non-fiction sections are located.

32
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:28,598
Our many biographies are housed on the

33
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:31,438
non-fiction side of the center counter.

34
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:34,511
I have many displays throughout the 
library and around the school,

35
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,078
but two of the most effective
ways I encourage student

36
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:40,757
interaction with literature
is by display of their works

37
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:44,198
such as book reviews, or
projects, and by intermingling

38
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:46,398
related materials to encourage further

39
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,479
exploration of the topics.

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,518
I keep the collection
current and relevant through

41
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:54,079
annual reading and by following 
my collection development plan

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,317
so I can offer my patrons 
a fantastic collection with enthusiastic

43
00:01:58,317 --> 00:02:01,108
and professional service.

44
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:03,357
- (inaudible)?

45
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:14,830
- (inaudible).

46
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:45,877
(background chatter)

47
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:48,918
- But we don't, we don't find
our food and just like...

48
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,998
(background chatter)

49
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:55,411
- The three little pig wolf thing?

50
00:02:55,411 --> 00:03:24,557
(inaudible).

51
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:28,637
- (inaudible).

52
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:31,558
- She counted all the way up.

53
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:35,677
And she wants to know
the lines or something.

54
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:38,397
- We're going to, now that you guys have

55
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:40,511
most of your categories filled in,

56
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,558
I would like for you to
flip over the lab sheet

57
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:44,797
that's in front of you.

58
00:03:44,797 --> 00:03:48,279
There are two reviews for this book.

59
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:52,998
Compare what you have on
your graphic organizer

60
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:55,678
to what you find in the review.

61
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:59,597
If you had mentioned that
Bridge was a protagonist,

62
00:03:59,597 --> 00:04:01,798
or basically mention Bridge and give some

63
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:04,757
description of Bridge, then
that would be something

64
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:07,078
that is in common with one of the reviews.

65
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,718
If you find something in common,

66
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:11,519
circle it on your graphic organizer.

67
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,278
I would like for you to
circle everything on your

68
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:17,117
graphic organizer that you
also see in the reviews.

69
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:23,957
And again, you can work with
your partner on this one.

70
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:36,797
(background chatter)

71
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:48,397
- (inaudible).

72
00:05:48,397 --> 00:06:12,917
- (inaudible).

73
00:06:12,917 --> 00:07:11,478
(background chatter)

74
00:07:11,478 --> 00:08:01,118
- (inaudible).

75
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:03,197
- (inaudible) it talks
about what they deserve

76
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:10,638
and (inaudible).

77
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:35,150
(background chatter)

78
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:45,237
- 30 more seconds.

79
00:08:45,237 --> 00:09:15,318
That's okay, (inaudible).

80
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:17,797
Did you find that there were
several things in common

81
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:21,879
between the elements you looked 
for and found in the story?

82
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,030
and what you find in the review?

83
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,278
- [Students] Yes.

84
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:27,391
-  The review has some additional
items in it, doesn't it?

85
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:30,957
There are a lot of people 
with the same basic items.

86
00:09:30,957 --> 00:09:36,838
Anyway, I wanted to do a
quick Venn-diagram up here,

87
00:09:36,838 --> 00:09:39,677
and compare and contrast.

88
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:42,477
I want for each group, this group,

89
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:46,437
I want each of the two of you to find one

90
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:50,637
thing that you found that
wasn't in the review.

91
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:53,398
Or, one thing that was
in the review that was

92
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:55,998
not on your paper.

93
00:09:55,998 --> 00:10:03,397
Okay, (inaudible).

94
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,157
Okay, you guys, I want you to find,

95
00:10:06,157 --> 00:10:08,917
one for each of those groups, I want
you to find one thing that

96
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:13,118
was in common (inaudible).

97
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:15,737
So this is compare, this is contrast.

98
00:10:15,737 --> 00:10:17,912
Contrast, compare.

99
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:19,318
Find one thing that was in common,

100
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:25,397
and one thing that's different.

101
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:29,719
Oh, okay, here's a sticky in the
middle of the table,

102
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:34,437
I want you to write it on the sticky.

103
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:35,997
You guys (inaudible) hard.

104
00:10:35,997 --> 00:11:30,597
(background chatter)

105
00:11:30,597 --> 00:12:18,877
(inaudible)

106
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:30,797
Awesome, step up here and tell 
us what it is and where does it go(inaudible).
?
107
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:40,677
- (inaudible).

108
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,757
Awesome, perfect.

109
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:55,957
So all you guys came up with a (inaudible).

110
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:56,877
(inaudible)

111
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:06,517
- We did like don't count your chickens 
before they hatch (inaudible) and it
was in our graphic organizer (inaudible).

112
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:10,558
- Oh, okay, (inaudible).

113
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:17,157
- (inaudible).

114
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:23,718
- (inaudible).

115
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,478
- Perfect, and that was (inaudible).

116
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:26,758
- (inaudible).,

117
00:13:26,758 --> 00:13:28,670
- Good, perfect.

118
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,790
Okay, so everybody here found
something that they had that

119
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,325
wasn't in the review, it was
in their graphic organizer.

120
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:36,798
(inaudible).

121
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,737
You guys, come on up.

122
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,867
This table, everyone at this
table is looking for something

123
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,197
that was found in both
their graphic organizer

124
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,397
and in the review.

125
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:54,157
- We found (inaudible).

126
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:56,878
- Super, (inaudible).

127
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,128
- (inaudible).

128
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,877
- Super, so that goes in the middle
because it's in common with both of them.

129
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:07,117
This group?

130
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:15,717
- (inaudible).

131
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:18,277
- Perfect, they found both
in the review and in their

132
00:14:18,277 --> 00:14:22,159
organizer that (inaudible).

133
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,077
- (inaudible).

134
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:27,157
- So that was a?

135
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,077
What category (inaudible)?

136
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,597
- (inaudible).

137
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:32,757
- Oh, was that in common?

138
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:35,757
Did you find it in the
review also or was it...?

139
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:37,157
- (inaudible).

140
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:38,477
- Just you guys found it?

141
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,517
So where would it go?

142
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,928
Excellent, excellent.

143
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:44,877
That would go in the graphic
organizer because it was

144
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:46,397
something that wasn't in the review,

145
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,757
so it would go over here, perfect.

146
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:55,812
Okay, next?

147
00:14:55,812 --> 00:15:05,317
- We found that the (inaudible).

148
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:08,519
- Okay, so you found something
that was only in the review

149
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,317
that the, how the pigs
disguised themselves.

150
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:13,342
Where do we put that on that?

151
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:18,518
Excellent, something that
was only found in the review.

152
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:26,357
Save the best for last.

153
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,438
What'd you guys find?

154
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,917
- We found that the graphic
organizer and the review,

155
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:32,837
they both talked about
(inaudible) that related to

156
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:36,157
(inaudible) like the (inaudible).

157
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:39,917
- The allusions in there,
Wizard of Oz, Three Little Pigs,

158
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,677
Excellent, that was (inaudible).

159
00:15:41,677 --> 00:15:46,438
So we see an awful lot
is in common with these.

160
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:48,078
Sometimes, you guys find
something that aren't in

161
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,397
the reviews, the reviews sometimes had 
something you didn't find.

162
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:52,837
They are a little bit different.

163
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:56,717
Not necessarily in your review cover every

164
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:58,718
literary element there is.

165
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:01,637
You won't necessarily tell them
the five different types of

166
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:05,917
literary devices that are used
there, and that's okay.

167
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:08,911
What you want to do with your review is

168
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:11,197
tell some about the book, and give a

169
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,766
substantiated opinion of the book.

170
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,598
Why do (inaudible)?

171
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:18,037
What are the good features of this book?

172
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:21,158
What are the weaknesses
in the book that you read?

173
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:24,870
Now there are other things
that you may need in there,

174
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,397
and I'll show where you can get
some additional information.

175
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:33,117
Let's bring this on down here.

176
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,038
In the online catalog.

177
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:38,110
Both of those computers
are logged in over there.

178
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,157
(inaudible).

179
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,312
Okay, look up.

180
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:45,637
So far (inaudible).

181
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,197
So if you want to make a note of

182
00:16:49,197 --> 00:16:51,438
how many pages as a reminder to yourself,

183
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,759
"Oh yeah, that was a really long book", 
or "Oh, that was a quick read."

184
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,182
That would be something to
kind of jog your memory there.

185
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:00,843
Things like, "Oh yeah,
this was about Korea."
