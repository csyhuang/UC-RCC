1
00:00:00,156 --> 00:00:01,886
- That's a start, ok, Devon and Sasha?

2
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:06,138
3 1/3, what are the classifications?

3
00:00:06,138 --> 00:00:07,718
- [Voiceover] Natural.

4
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:09,121
- No, not natural.

5
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:10,224
- [Voiceover] Rational.

6
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:11,187
- Yes, rational.

7
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:11,826
- [Voiceover] Real.

8
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:12,844
- Yes.

9
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:15,190
- Ok, it's rational, and it's real.

10
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,860
Now Brian, you had first said natural.

11
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,459
- Yeah, I kinda,

12
00:00:19,459 --> 00:00:22,095
because a fraction isn't natural.

13
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:24,486
- Ok, right, a fraction is not natural.

14
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:27,714
Who else can tell us something
about natural numbers then?

15
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:30,187
What do we know about our natural numbers?

16
00:00:30,187 --> 00:00:31,361
- They're the counting numbers.

17
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:31,918
- Yeah.

18
00:00:31,918 --> 00:00:32,928
- Ok, counting numbers,

19
00:00:32,928 --> 00:00:34,484
what do we mean by that,
the counting numbers?

20
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:36,060
- [Voiceover] Numbers that you count with?

21
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,284
- Like one, two, three.

22
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:40,746
- Ok, our natural numbers
are our counting numbers.

23
00:00:40,746 --> 00:00:45,285
So 3 1/3, again, was just a--

24
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:45,994
- Rational.

25
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:47,120
- Rational and a--

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,049
- [Voiceover] Real.

27
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,176
- Ok, very good, somebody else.

28
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,386
Ok go ahead, Natalie?

29
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,479
- Square root of 19.

30
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,892
What are the classifications?

31
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:56,845
- [Voiceover] Rational.

32
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:57,852
- [Teacher] Hold on one second, thank you.

33
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,628
Can you show us your number?

34
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:03,201
So the square root of 19.

35
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,991
Ok.

36
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:06,221
- [Voiceover] Irrational?

37
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,695
- It's irrational, I decided.

38
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:08,755
- [Voiceover] It's irrational.

39
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:11,459
'Cause it's the square root
of a nonperfect number.

40
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,795
- Nonperfect square.

41
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:13,661
- [Voiceover] Nonperfect square.

42
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:16,284
- Ok, so Sasha and Christina both agree

43
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,177
that it's irrational, and Christina,

44
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,117
what else did you say?

45
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:20,287
I'm not sure if they heard.

46
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:21,085
- It's a nonperfect square.

47
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:22,590
- Ok, it's not a perfect square.

48
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,154
- [Voiceover] And it's also real.

49
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,720
- Ok, it is irrational, and,

50
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,053
we wanna remember that,

51
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,589
an irrational number
is also a real number,

52
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,143
even though it doesn't end or repeat.

53
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:37,827
How did you know, without
using your calculator,

54
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,750
that the square root of 19
was an irrational number?

55
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,283
- It doesn't make a perfect square.

56
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:44,805
- Ok, and how do you know it
doesn't make a perfect square?

57
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,259
- Because, I have no idea.

58
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,254
- If you multiply two
numbers, you don't get it.

59
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:53,286
- Ok, very good, that's exactly right.

60
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:55,619
- You actually can multiply
two numbers to get 19--

61
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:56,838
- It's just a decimal or--

62
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:59,268
- Yeah, it's an irrational decimal.

63
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,454
- It's an irrational decimal, ok.

64
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:04,254
So you can multiply,

65
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,868
and we looked at an example,

66
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:08,659
of that, we did a little activity

67
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,170
with the square root of 19.

68
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,721
Is it gonna be two whole numbers

69
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:14,585
that you could multiply, to get 19?

70
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:15,315
Mm-mmm.

71
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,553
And that's what makes it irrational.

72
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:20,327
Compared with, if you did
like the square root of 16,

73
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,095
what two numbers can you multiply to get--

74
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:23,021
- [Voiceover] Four and four.

75
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:25,084
- Four and four, ok, good.

76
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:26,770
Ok, how 'bout another number?

77
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:29,754
Go ahead.

78
00:02:29,754 --> 00:02:31,001
- The classifications of 1/3.

79
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,187
- Rational and real.

80
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,893
- Ok, rational, real.

81
00:02:36,893 --> 00:02:40,166
Anyone wanna throw in
anything else about 1/3?

82
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:42,726
Mm-hmm?

83
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:45,082
- The greater the decimal, it's repeating.

84
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,753
- [Teacher] Right, it's
a repeating decimal.

85
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,343
- It doesn't end, but it does repeat.

86
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,049
- [Teacher] Ok, so if it were--

87
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,721
- If it was, you could
get a rational number.

88
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,449
- Right, and that makes it a
rational number, very good.

89
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,086
Ok, we looked at several numbers.

90
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:58,045
How about someone ask a question?

91
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,350
Someone wanna throw in a question?

92
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,424
Ok, go ahead Scotty.

93
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:02,577
- What integers are also whole numbers?

94
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,956
- Ok, what integers, and let's make sure

95
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:08,615
everybody's having the
opportunity to answer questions.

96
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:09,753
Repeat that again.

97
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:11,820
- What integers are also whole numbers?

98
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,841
- Ok, so what integers
are also whole numbers?

99
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,636
- [Voiceover] Two can be
a whole and an integer.

100
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,791
- Ok, what did you say first?

101
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,662
- Two.

102
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,784
- [Teacher] Ok, two is an example,

103
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:25,990
it can be an integer and a whole number.

104
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,894
- [Voiceover] Positive numbers?

105
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:29,214
Positive numbers?

106
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:30,988
- Ok, our positive numbers.

107
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:32,927
- [Voiceover] Negative
numbers could be, too.

108
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,748
- [Teachers] Can negative
numbers be whole numbers though?

109
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,525
- [Class] No.

110
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:38,326
- [Teacher] No?

111
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:39,719
- It can, zero.

112
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,705
- Ok, zero.

113
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,450
- Positive numbers.

114
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,028
- Ok, who remembers, what
example did I give you,

115
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,685
when we're thinking about whole numbers?

116
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,718
- [Voiceover] Pets!

117
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,256
- What can help you think
about whole numbers?

118
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:51,023
- Pets?

119
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,126
- Ok, Sasha says pets.

120
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:54,572
Who can elaborate on what that means?

121
00:03:54,572 --> 00:03:55,289
- The number of pets you have--

122
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,120
- Count the number of pets you have.

123
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,361
- And then we asked for
a number or something.

124
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:03,693
They wouldn't say, like I have
3/4 of a dog or something.

125
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,457
- Ok, so if you'd ask somebody
how many pets they have,

126
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:08,453
their answers are always gonna be what?

127
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:09,255
- [Class] A whole number.

128
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:10,323
- A whole number, which,

129
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:12,157
and what are our whole numbers?

130
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,026
- Zero, one.

131
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,489
- Zero to infinity.

132
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,252
- Zero through all the way.

133
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:17,144
- Ok, mm-hmm.

134
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:19,024
Zero and all.

135
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:19,651
Alright, good.

136
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,946
Good question, Scotty.

137
00:04:20,946 --> 00:04:22,385
Let's have another question.

138
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:23,256
Go ahead Luke.

139
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:26,077
- Is a negative number
rational or irrational?

140
00:04:26,077 --> 00:04:28,457
- Ok, turn that around so we can see.

141
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:31,348
So is a negative number,
can it be classified

142
00:04:31,348 --> 00:04:33,426
as rational, or irrational?

143
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:35,254
- [Voiceover] It would
be a rational number?

144
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:35,791
- No.

145
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,448
- [Teacher] A negative
number is a rational number?

146
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,061
- It would be both.

147
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:38,758
- Yeah!

148
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:39,826
- It would be both.

149
00:04:39,826 --> 00:04:41,660
- If you have the square
root of a negative number.

150
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,587
- [Voiceover] It's an integer.

151
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:44,889
- Take the square root
of a negative number.

152
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,993
- An integer is always rational, so--

153
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:48,248
- An integer is rational.

154
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:49,743
- And a negative number is a,

155
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:52,581
is rational.

156
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:54,891
- But his question, let's see that again.

157
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,747
Is a negative number,
so it could be rational.

158
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,487
Can we have a negative
number that's irrational?

159
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,322
Can somebody give me an example of that?

160
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,518
- Negative pi.

161
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:06,120
- [Teacher] Ok, negative pi, mm-hmm.

162
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,115
- The negative square root of two?

163
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:11,361
- Ok, the negative
square root of a number.

164
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,881
Would the negative have
to be on the outside,

165
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,285
or the inside of the pi?

166
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,411
- [Class] Outside.

167
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,178
- The pi?

168
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,492
- I mean, outside the square root sign.

169
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:21,424
So Luke, can you conclude us,

170
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,394
what was your answer to that question?

171
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:24,555
- Sometimes both.

172
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:26,425
- [Teacher] Ok, it can be both.

173
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:27,730
Mm-hmm, good.

174
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,111
Alright, good question too.

175
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,528
What about another number?

176
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:31,258
What's another number?

177
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:32,107
Madison, go ahead.

178
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,453
- The square root of 144.

179
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:37,473
- [Teacher] Ok, the square root of 144,

180
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:39,992
who can give us the
different classifications?

181
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:40,651
- Real.

182
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:42,456
- Ok, Damian says real.

183
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,420
- Natural.

184
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,116
- [Teacher] Natural.

185
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:45,044
- [Voiceover] Whole.

186
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:45,759
- Whole.

187
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,662
- Integer.

188
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:47,442
- Yeah.

189
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,726
- Integer.

190
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:49,672
Any others?

191
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:50,453
- Rational.

192
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:51,727
- Ok, it's rational.

193
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:53,822
Do you agree, Madison?

194
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:54,353
- [Madison] Yes.

195
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,186
- Ok, very good.

196
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:57,426
So we looked at when that's,

197
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:59,789
if we look at our graphic organizer,

198
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,612
when it starts here with natural,

199
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,886
we read this going out, that it has

200
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:05,023
all those different classifications.

201
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:05,754
Good.

202
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:07,054
Ok, how about another number?

203
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:08,088
Go ahead, Amy.

204
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:11,327
- What is the difference
between these two numbers?

205
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,824
The negative square root of nine,

206
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:15,019
and the square root of negative nine.

207
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,528
- [Teacher] Ok, I like that question.

208
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,920
So what's the difference
between those two?

209
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,218
So on the first example,
we see the negative

210
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:23,657
on the outside of the square root sign,

211
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:26,524
and then we see it on the inside.

212
00:06:26,524 --> 00:06:28,555
- [Voiceover] One's real and one's not.

213
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,505
- [Teacher] Ok, Damian says one's real,

214
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,910
and one's not.

215
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,941
- When it's in the inside, it's not real.

216
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:35,559
Because you can't take the square root

217
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:36,859
of a negative number.

218
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,519
- Exactly, we cannot take the square root

219
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,483
of a negative number.

220
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,535
So when we see it on the inside,

221
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,323
there's not a solution to it.

222
00:06:43,323 --> 00:06:44,890
What about when it's on the outside?

223
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,027
- You can take the square root of it

224
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,652
and just add the negative sign.

225
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,115
- Ok, so what would that answer be,

226
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:51,473
negative square root of nine?

227
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:52,485
- Negative three.

228
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,353
- Right, negative three.

229
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,918
Let's talk a little bit
more in depth about,

230
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,577
when that negative is
inside the square root,

231
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:00,586
why do we not have a solution to that?

232
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,954
So it was a square root of negative nine.

233
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:05,998
- Because you can't multiply
two numbers to get a negative.

234
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:08,427
- Right, exactly.

235
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,783
So if we had like the square root of nine,

236
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,792
what two numbers can we
multiply to give us--

237
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,288
- Three.

238
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,358
- Oh, nine, three and three.

239
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,226
- Three and three, and
remember how we talked about,

240
00:07:17,226 --> 00:07:20,653
what is the inverse of taking
the square root of a number?

241
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:21,352
- Squaring it?

242
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:22,350
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,220
So there's not two numbers we can multiply

244
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,785
to give us that negative nine, good.

245
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,678
Alright, let's have another number.

246
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:30,006
Go ahead Brock.

247
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:30,703
- Ok.

248
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,261
3.14, pi.

249
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:38,945
- [Teacher] I'm glad you
showed that number, 3.14.

250
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:40,606
- [Voiceover] That is not pi.

251
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,510
It's rational and real.

252
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,759
- [Voiceover] It's irrational.

253
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,786
- [Voiceover] No, it's rational.

254
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:48,552
- It's not rational, because
it never ends or repeats.

255
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,489
- [Voiceover] It is rational.

256
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:51,950
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but 3.14 ends.

257
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,655
- [Voiceover] Yes, it ends.

258
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,892
- [Voiceover] It's 3.14, not pi.

259
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,053
- [Voiceover] That's not pi.

260
00:07:57,253 --> 00:08:01,461
(class chatter)

261
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,549
- Pi doesn't end.

262
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,721
- [Voiceover] That one ends, pi doesn't end.

263
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:08,053
- Ok, so are we all in
agreement that the number pi,

264
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:10,782
is an irrational number
that doesn't end or repeat?

265
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,120
- [Class] Yes.

266
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,925
- But what is Brock's number?

267
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,051
- [Class] 3.14.

268
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:19,347
- 3.14, so that number, 3.14--

269
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:20,020
- [Voiceover] Ends.

270
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,251
- It ends.

271
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,777
So, what are the
classifications for that number?

272
00:08:23,777 --> 00:08:25,028
- [Class] Rational and real.

273
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,328
- It's rational and real.

274
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,892
Now when we're working problems,

275
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:31,026
like area, or circumference of a circle,

276
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:33,325
why do we use 3.14?

277
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:34,192
- Because it's easier.

278
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:35,125
- [Voiceover] Because it's easier.

279
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,890
- Right, could we use
a whole number for pi,

280
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,958
to do a calculation?

281
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:38,817
- [Class] No.

282
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,211
- No way it's gonna end.

283
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:41,592
- Right, it would never end.

284
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:42,939
So when we're doing our calculations,

285
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,982
we use that 3.14.

286
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,351
But, Brock I'm glad you had that number,

287
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:49,255
so, you know, there's that difference.

288
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,952
Pi doesn't end, but just 3.14 does end.

289
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:53,707
Mm-hmm?

290
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:56,804
- Square root of negative 41.

291
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,173
- Ok, can you show everyone your number?

292
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,553
So the square root of negative 41.

293
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:02,691
- [Class] Not real.

294
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:04,061
- Ok, not a real number.

295
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,524
- But if it was real, then,

296
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:07,207
and they were on the outside,

297
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,425
then it'd be irrational, wouldn't it?

298
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,317
- Ok, and why would that be irrational,

299
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,360
the square root of 41?

300
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,123
(class mumbling)

301
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:19,479
Mm-hmm, no two numbers that can multiply.

302
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,592
Not the same two whole numbers.

303
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:24,239
Let me ask you a question
about the square root of 41.

304
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,946
What if your neighbor came and said,

305
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:28,418
I'd like for you to help me,

306
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,195
make a fenced-in area for my dog,

307
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,890
and I want it to be a square,

308
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,922
and I want the area to be 41.

309
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:35,791
How would you maybe
respond to your neighbor?

310
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,803
- Make it 49.

311
00:09:37,803 --> 00:09:38,446
- Ok.

312
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,090
- 'Cause it wouldn't be a square.

313
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,225
- [Voiceover] It wouldn't
be a perfect square.

314
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,455
- If it was 41?

315
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,557
Ok, so you, what did you say Damian?

316
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,723
- To make it, like 41, so
you could have a seven by,

317
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,627
or 49, so you could have seven by seven.

318
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,478
- Ok, good.

319
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:53,384
- [Voiceover] Or make it a six by six, 36.

320
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,139
- Ok.

321
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,660
- I would tell him to make it way bigger,

322
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,494
because a dog needs a lot of space.

323
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:00,848
- No that wouldn't actually
be a very big area, would it?

324
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:01,753
- [Voiceover] No that would be small.

325
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:02,661
- Unless maybe it was a small dog.

326
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:03,451
- Yes.

327
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,633
- A really small dog,
like a teacup chihuahua.

328
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,517
- Ok, how about another question?

329
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:08,759
- Oh!

330
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,222
- Ok.

331
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:13,536
- Are repeating decimals ever fractions?

332
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:14,103
- [Voiceover] No.

333
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,728
- Yes, 1/3.

334
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,451
- So you could have a repeating decimal

335
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,519
as a fraction?

336
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,051
- Yeah, 1/3.

337
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:20,640
- Ok.

338
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,159
- 2/6.

339
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,528
- It's a bunch of threes.

340
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:24,387
- Yes.

341
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:27,144
- Ok, 1/3, definitely, that
was the number Damian had,

342
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:28,293
a bunch of threes.

343
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:31,405
And you said, now two, what about 2/6?

344
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:32,717
- It's repeating also.

345
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:34,981
- Ok, 'cause that will
reduce back to what?

346
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:35,759
- 1/3.

347
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,825
- 1/3, ok.

348
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,637
Alright, how about another number?

349
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:41,468
Ethan?

350
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,289
- Square root of two.

351
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,891
- Alright, I don't know
if you can see that,

352
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:47,388
but the square root of two.

353
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:49,350
What if you try to take
the square root of two?

354
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,989
- [Voiceover] It's irrational.

355
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:50,790
- Irrational.

356
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,820
- Ok, it's an irrational
number, but it's also a...

357
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,854
- [Class] Real.

358
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,386
- Real number, good, alright.

359
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:58,139
Another number that we can look at?

360
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:59,683
Maybe someone who's not answered.

361
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:00,624
Down here?

362
00:11:00,624 --> 00:11:01,619
Nicole?

363
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,821
- Five divided by zero.

364
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,389
- Oh, that's a good
one, we've not had that.

365
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,525
How about five divided by zero.

366
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:07,326
- [Voiceover] It's not real.

367
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,092
- [Voiceover] That's not real.

368
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,741
- Ok, not a real number again.

369
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:11,522
Can we go a little bit further?

370
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:13,217
Why is that not a real number?

371
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:15,922
- Because there's no longer
a number you can multiply by,

372
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:16,839
it's zero.

373
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:18,488
- [Voiceover] Anything divided
by zero is not a real number.

374
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:19,624
- Ok, I had several of you talking,

375
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,215
and I do want to hear everyone.

376
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,154
What did you say Natalie?

377
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,083
- It's undefined.

378
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,812
- [Teacher] Ok, we do
say that's undefined.

379
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,692
Michael, could you add to that?

380
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:30,921
- You can't divide anything by zero.

381
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,918
- Ok, you can't divide anything by zero.

382
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,179
And if you look on the overhead,

383
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,417
if I were to write that
out, and put five inside

384
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,320
as our dividend, and zero as our divisor,

385
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,456
is there a number I can multiply by zero

386
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:44,292
to get five?

387
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,417
- No, 'cause anything times zero is zero.

388
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,361
- So that makes it undefined.

389
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:49,556
Ok, very good.

390
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,411
Ok, another number.

391
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,187
- Ooh! Ooh!

392
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,184
(speaker mumbles)

393
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:56,751
- Ok, Cliff go ahead, and then Brock,

394
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:59,352
you had your hand raised,
I'll come back to you.

395
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,245
- The square root of 53.

396
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,951
- Ok, hold that up so everyone can see.

397
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,844
Ok, we have the square root of 53.

398
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:07,653
Classifications for square root of 53.

399
00:12:07,653 --> 00:12:08,547
- [Class] Irrational.

400
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:09,906
- Irrational and...

401
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:10,753
- [Class] Real.

402
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:11,993
- And real, very good.

403
00:12:11,993 --> 00:12:13,688
Ok Brock, how about your number?

404
00:12:13,688 --> 00:12:16,422
- Ok, the square root of a prime number

405
00:12:16,422 --> 00:12:17,884
is always what?

406
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,858
- [Teacher] Ok, Brock's
given us a question.

407
00:12:19,858 --> 00:12:21,391
Can you repeat that again?

408
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:24,421
- The square root of a
prime number is always what?

409
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:25,849
- [Teacher] Oh, that's
a very good question.

410
00:12:25,849 --> 00:12:27,393
- [Class] Irrational.

411
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,856
- Ok, so if it's a prime number,

412
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:30,179
and you're trying to take the square root,

413
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:31,619
it's always irrational.

414
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:35,039
Ethan, you said irrational,
can you expand on that?

415
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:39,919
- I said the square root of a prime number

416
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,185
will always be irrational

417
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:44,637
because you cannot make a
square out of a prime number,

418
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:49,353
you have to have two, for
it to be a perfect square.

419
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,373
You have to have two
numbers, prime numbers,

420
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:53,753
and you have one, and the number itself.

421
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,052
- [Teacher] Ok, only
those two factors, right.

422
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,619
Ok, very good.

423
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,721
Ok, maybe another question.

424
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:00,831
Mm-hmm.

425
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:04,056
- Is a repeating decimal
rational or irrational?

426
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:06,820
- So if it's a repeating decimal.

427
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,422
- [Class] Rational.

428
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:09,594
- Rational?

429
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:11,057
- Yes.

430
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,693
- Ok, very good, how
about another question,

431
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,514
that we could discuss?

432
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:15,362
Madison?

433
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:16,256
- True or false:

434
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,878
a terminating decimal
means the decimal repeats.

435
00:13:19,878 --> 00:13:20,992
- [Voiceover] It's false.

436
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:23,059
- Ok, it's false.

437
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,943
What does that mean,
Mariah, if it's terminating?

438
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:27,572
- It...

439
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:29,618
- So if it terminates, it--

440
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:30,327
- It ends.

441
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,894
- It ends, right, exactly.

442
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,821
Ok, how about another number?

443
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,958
Anyone, an example, we've not had many

444
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,245
with integers.

445
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:39,754
I see you.

446
00:13:39,754 --> 00:13:42,577
How about one with a negative number?

447
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,206
Anybody have one with a negative number?

448
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:47,022
Brian, you do?

449
00:13:47,022 --> 00:13:47,684
Ok.

450
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:51,025
- I have the square root of negative 225.

451
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,395
- [Class] Not real.

452
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:53,451
- Ok, not real, again,

453
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,146
why is that not a real number?

454
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:55,956
- Because it's negative.

455
00:13:55,956 --> 00:13:58,394
- [Voiceover] The decimal's inside.

456
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,739
- Ok, well not the decimal
is inside but the--

457
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,258
- [Voiceover] Negative.

458
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,408
- The negative's inside.

459
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,657
I wanna throw a number out.

460
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:08,384
How about negative 4/5?

461
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:10,938
For the number negative 4/5.

462
00:14:11,858 --> 00:14:13,238
- [Voiceover] Rational?

463
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,360
- [Voiceover] Yeah, rational.

464
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,693
- Ok, it's a rational number and it is a--

465
00:14:16,693 --> 00:14:17,715
- [Class] Real number.

466
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:19,782
- Is it a negative number?

467
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:20,490
- Yes.

468
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,256
- No!

469
00:14:21,256 --> 00:14:22,057
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

470
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:22,951
- [Voiceover] No?

471
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:23,717
- Hmmm.

472
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:25,587
So negative 4/5.

473
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:27,758
Wouldn't that be considered an integer?

474
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:28,756
- [Class] No.

475
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:31,461
- Because it's not a whole
or a natural number.

476
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:32,355
- Ok, very good.

477
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:34,851
What do we know, we haven't
talked too much about integers.

478
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:36,285
What do we know about our integers?

479
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,055
How do we classify an integer?

480
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,180
- That it's whole numbers
and their opposites?

481
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,049
- Ok, whole numbers and their opposites.

482
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,860
And we used our number line in class.

483
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,217
Do we have any fractions or decimals

484
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,785
on our number line?

485
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:48,620
- [Class] No.

486
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,651
- So what numbers are
not considered integers?

487
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:52,452
- [Class] Decimals.

488
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:53,590
- Decimals and...

489
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,751
- [Class] Fractions.

490
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:57,084
- Ok, so if they have that
negative sign in front of them,

491
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,323
then what do we call em?

492
00:14:58,323 --> 00:14:59,909
If they're not integers.
