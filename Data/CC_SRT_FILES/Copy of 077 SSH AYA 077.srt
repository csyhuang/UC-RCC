1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,250
- [Instructor] And then with Carl's
example was down to MSB, marginal social

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,720
benefit. So how can we put that into
words? Marginal social benefit. Andrew?

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,350
- [Andrew] Isn't it something that can't
really be measured?

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,280
- Okay. Yes, and it's harder to measure,
but how would you explain it? What is it?

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,320
Think about what we did in the example and
say like, everybody is benefiting from

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,520
washing cars. Right?

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:31,090
- [Student] So, what is... It is a social
benefit and it's what he gets from the

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,180
society.
- It's what society gets from you.

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,030
- Yeah, you're on the track, but it's what
we get from his interaction. Right? Okay.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,860
So, it's the benefit to society for
whatever market that is. Okay? So, social

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:54,520
benefit, this is going to be the
additional benefit, okay? The additional

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:02,480
benefit that society... those that are not
involved in the transaction, but from

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:14,116
society get from one more unit. Okay? Now,
I'm going to put next to this slash costs.

14
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:18,580
Oh, just kidding. That's... that's the
other document. So, down here is just

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:26,430
something is a negative thing. So what
this leads to... Do you think these two

16
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,300
definitions lead to positive externality
or negative externality?
- [Students together] Positive

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,890
Positive, they're things that market itself does  
not take care of. Okay? Market, obviously, in this

18
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,910
example, does not take Carl and offer YTB
for all of our benefits, considering it

19
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,647
doesn't pay him at all. Right? There are
things in society that, when you look at

20
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,730
the actual amount someone is paid, they're
maybe not paid to the extent of the

21
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,830
benefit they get. Okay? So, right now if
you flip over to the back, we'll come back

22
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,120
to definitions later, flip over to the
back. Oh, I'm sorry, on the other sheet,

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,850
because I didn't put it on the back, on
the other sheet you have two columns. I

24
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,990
want you first, by yourselves, without
talking to someone else, think of, try to

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,570
think of at least two examples where there
are things in society where there are

26
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,880
markets for these and it makes everyone
better off because they're there, and we

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,230
all benefit from them. Okay? Go ahead,
write them down. Think about it. You

28
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,780
really think, you're going to have to
defend it. So, think about, on your own,

29
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,980
what markets are out there, things that
happen, that benefit everybody, not just

30
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,920
the people participating in the market.
So, benefits more people than are just

31
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,950
paying for the service, not just the
buyers or the sellers of that service, but

32
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,980
outside of it, people are benefiting from
it. Write and think and then we'll talk

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,970
about them. Write and think, write and
think.

34
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,360
- [Student] Wait, do we need negative
ones, too?

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,360
- Just positive right now, we're going to
go back to the negative ones. So, just

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,910
think of the positive ones right now.
Okay, benefit people, again, let's cover

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,150
the definition again. Benefit people
outside of the buyers and sellers in that

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:06,040
transaction. Okay? So, we're not talking
about just the buyer of someone who goes

39
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,950
to a store and buys something and the
benefit they get from it, that's marginal

40
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,723
benefit, but that person buying this gives
other people benefit outside of that

41
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,027
person.

42
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:23,960
- [Student] But, like if they built a
hospital in the neighborhood, and it has a

43
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,635
reputation of being not like, they don't
have a lot of equipment, it's not very

44
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:31,620
good. Then, could you like, the property
values of the of the town go down.

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,300
- So, you could talk about... Okay. So,
you're on absolutely the right track, so

46
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,540
then that would be a negative.

47
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,730
- [Student] Like, so what could always be
a positive benefit?

48
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,870
- Okay. Well, let's talk about some of the
negatives. Some of you wrote some stuff

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,160
down. I saw Matt right away think of
something, what'd you write down?

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,700
- [Matt] I said flu shots.
- Okay. Why?

51
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,180
- Because the more healthy people there
are around the less you'll... I don't

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,210
know. The less sick people there are, the
more healthy people there are.

53
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,030
- Overall, right? Because, if one
of you... Think about this. If one of

54
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,120
us... If half of the class gets flu shots
and the other half doesn't that mentality

55
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,440
shows us that now that other half is more
likely to get the flu, right? So, that is

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,370
an absolutely... Flu shots. What could you
make that into a broader explanation.

57
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,540
- [Students together] Vaccinations.

58
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,993
- Vaccinations. Okay? Vaccinations. So, go
ahead and write those two down because

59
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:19,470
those two are textbook examples.
- [Student] Is medicine good?

60
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,480
- Medicine... It depends if it's
contagious, but go ahead and be more

61
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,190
specific, so you want to put flu vaccine
or any kind of vaccine. It's a perfect

62
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,480
example because that is a big issue right
now. A lot of parents are talking about

63
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,320
not vaccinating their children because
they're worried about issues of autism

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,780
that have been indirectly, slightly
connected to it, but, for the most part,

65
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,660
that has not been proven yet, so now we're
seeing other ramifications of that

66
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,910
decision. Over here, go ahead

67
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,240
- Pro sports.
- Pro sports, tell me why.

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
- People who play get paid for doing it
and the fans enjoy watching them.

69
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,390
- Okay, good. So, pro sports, and we're
not even talking about people that

70
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,650
necessarily pay for the ticket to go. You
might just get to watch on TV. A lot of

71
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,060
times on the main stations, you don't even
have to pay cable lines. So, you would go

72
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,020
ahead and benefit from those.

73
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,370
- [Student] If you pay, aren't you
technically then part of that?

74
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,070
- If you paid for it then you're part of
that market.

75
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,680
- [Student] So, like vaccinations. You pay
for vaccine.

76
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,610
- Okay. But that person that pays for the
vaccination doesn't get it, but all of us

77
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,590
benefit because that one student got the
vaccine. Okay? So, that's the key. It

78
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,560
benefits people outside of the one paying
for it. So, that's why it's social. Okay?

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,100
Sam?
- [Sam] YouTube.

80
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,350
- Okay. Tell me why.

81
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,420
- Because people can freely put up any
type of videos they want. That uses

82
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,900
creativity and people that want to hear
music from anywhere can do it wherever

83
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,605
they want.

84
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,708
- Absolutely. So, YouTube is a great
modern example, because we all benefit

85
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,220
from that kind of laughter, that
enjoyment. It doesn't cost us anything.

86
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,660
People do it for their own interest and we
all benefit. Cody.

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,090
- [Cody] Education.
- Education. Tell me why.

88
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,830
- Students learn and they get to do well
in the world and then the world gets some

89
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,110
technology.

90
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,120
- Okay. Good. Like, you brought up tax
payers. So, your parents pay for your

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,110
education in school. Right? But, by the
fact that you're becoming educated, even

92
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,550
if they pay for your college tuition. Now,
you don't give back just to your parents

93
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,720
with that education, you give back to
society overall. Right? To everyone,

94
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,790
hopefully, in the world, one way or
another, you end up giving back to

95
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:21,340
society. For more people than are paying
for your education. Okay. Yeah?

96
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,420
- [Student] Clean energy, like electric
cars or something, because even if you

97
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,830
yourself don't drive one, that makes like,
it improves.

98
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,310
- Okay. Anything green. Absolutely.
Anything green like that. You can put

99
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,838
green technologies benefit the world,
which kind of brings us to one that we're

100
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:39,270
going to talk about with a negative. Okay.
Yeah.

101
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,510
- [Student] I just had a question. Could
you put stock, like since if someone buys

102
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,100
a stock it raises the price for everyone
else?

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,730
- Yeah, I've never heard that example, but
you could argue that. It's still

104
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:55,290
benefiting a select group, though. I guess
in some stocks though, that's millions and

105
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,900
millions of people, so, I mean, you might
be able to argue.

106
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,422
- [Student] I didn't know, because they're
still involved in the transaction.

107
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:03,350
- They're only involved if it's their
initial one. So, that's why I think it's

108
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,050
worth some argument there. You might be
able to prove that. I think some of the

109
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,900
other ones across the board are a little
bit more general but that's definitely

110
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,430
something to think about. Andrew?

111
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,960
- [Andrew] Well see, I agree with him,
because when the stock prices go up people

112
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,070
see that as "Oh, the public is spending
more," so that would bring the economy

113
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,980
up, which would bring--

114
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,590
- That's a really good point because
that's an indicator of the health of the

115
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,640
economy.
- Right.

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,660
- So, by the stock market being high, it
makes everyone employ people. Yeah, that's

117
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,590
a good extra point to add in. Yeah.

118
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:35,350
- [Student] What about something like... sorry
[Background Chatter]

119
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,250
- [Instructor] You were thinking of the same
thing at the same time? Alright, go ahead.

120
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,506
- [Student] So, like, taxpayers, and the
government pays them and even if you don't

121
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:44,950
pay taxes you still benefit from it.

122
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:48,060
- You could actually put public works down
in your column, because now that we've

123
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,410
kind of opened that can, we can think
about parks, right? And I get the example

124
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,510
all the time. There's a really nice park I
live right by Glenn Ellen, and I am not

125
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,900
technically in Glenn Ellen but right by
there, then I go down there, I run by the

126
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,110
park, I take advantage of that public
area, and I add to my benefit. So, just by

127
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,890
having that park, it kind of benefits more
people than just the people that pay for

128
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,140
it. So, any public works. Police, you
could talk about firemen, they benefit

129
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,920
many more people than the people that pay
for them.

130
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,870
- [Student] The people that clear the snow
off the roads. Delightful.

131
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:32,020
- [Instructor] Can I get some negative
externalities then? Flip it back over.

132
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,560
Let's go right on. Flip it to the other
sheet and let's go to the other thing here

133
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,910
and then we'll start graphing it. Marginal
costs. Let's put that in our own words

134
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:45,910
here. What is the marginal cost of these?
Everyone think about it for a second.

135
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,570
Think about it, write down your own
definition. This is something you should

136
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,510
know like the back of your hand at this
point. In your own words, write down the

137
00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:02,000
definition of marginal costs.  Write it down, 
you already did? ...Marginal cost...

138
00:09:02,000 --> 0:09:03,500
You got it Andrew?

139
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
What is marginal cost?

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,390
What is marginal cost?

141
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,450
- [Student] The extra cost of hiring one
additional worker.

142
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,050
- Okay. One more whatever it is. It
doesn't have to be a worker. We're all

143
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,530
thinking about workers because we just got
out of inputs, we just got out of inputs

144
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,620
and factor markets and resource markets,
but, remember those units one, two and

145
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:43,058
three, they had marginal cost, too. If you
picture a monopoly graph, what does

146
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:46,307
marginal cost look like on a monopoly
graph?

147
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:47,720
- [Student] Upward sloping.

148
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,210
- Upward sloping, right? So, we can think
of the system in every unit. So, what does

149
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,400
it need? One, the additional cost of what?

150
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,010
- [Students together] One more unit.

151
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,020
- One more unit. Let's just keep it like
that, because input is just factors. One

152
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,500
more unit, because in a monopoly, it's
marginal cost of making one more unit. In

153
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,170
a labor market, it's the additional cost
of one more worker. Keep in mind again,

154
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,590
these are both people that are
participating in that market. So, I'm

155
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,860
going to put... This is the same thing,
except for it's the cost. So, you wrote it

156
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,900
ready in your own words but make sure
you've got that basic idea. Additional

157
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,020
cost of one more unit. So, now we're
applying it to this new idea. What's the

158
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:30,961
marginal social cost of something? The
marginal social cost. Andrew?

159
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,993
- [Andrew] How much society loses for one
more unit.

160
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:40,470
- Okay. How much society loses for one
more unit or how much it takes away, or

161
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,870
cost us when we make one more unit. So,
we're going to think, and I'm going to add

162
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:52,940
thoughts here. It's for all of society.
So, flip it over, what are some examples,

163
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,249
or go to the other sheet. What are some
examples of negative externalities now

164
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:59,990
that we've got this down in your mind.
What are some negatives? Zach.

165
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,618
- [Zach] Breathing in pollution.

166
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:07,790
- Pollution. That again, he is on it, this
is the textbook definition. Pollution is

167
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:14,710
the most common example. So, what has
government implemented to try to curtail

168
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,900
pollution? What kind of things have they
done?

169
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,800
- [Student] Smoking ban laws.

170
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,950
- Okay, good, smoking bans. So, you could
say pollution, you could also say

171
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,230
cigarette smoke is a negative externality.
So, government stepped in, which is the

172
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,780
type of pollution. The government stepped
in and said "No, you cannot smoke in

173
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,170
places of employment, you cannot smoke in
any public area in Illinois, " it's

174
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,000
obviously done by state, but the state has
stepped in to curtail this type of

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,380
externality. Betty?

176
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,620
- [Betty] Don't they have pollution rights
that they can buy in the market?

177
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,060
- Okay. Very good. Who do they buy them
from?

178
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,290
- The government.

179
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,900
- Good. So, federal government actually
sells pollution rights. So, that's another

180
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,720
way that they deal with it. What agency
was created to deal with pollution?

181
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,200
- [Student] The EPA.

182
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,080
- EPA. So, the EPA is out there trying to
make sure that only so much pollution

183
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,813
happens. Yeah.

184
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:05,660
- [Student] This is kind of more local,
but like banks in Elmhurst, like they make

185
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:16,158
a lot of banks, a ton of banks, but every
single time they make a new one it seems

186
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:19,830
like less use of all the banks like
there's no point to them and it's like a

187
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,620
lot of--

188
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,990
- So, you're saying that's a negative
externality because there's too much?

189
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:30,340
- [Student] Not just that there's just
like... Say you replace a store that maybe

190
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,082
some people use and make a bank and then
there's less to do in Elmhurst.

191
00:12:35,082 --> 00:12:39,230
- Okay. Try to think of the best way... I
mean, I see what you're saying because

192
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,940
that transaction takes away from your
enjoyment of living in a town.

193
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,230
- [Student] You could put something else
there like a new house or a restaurant or

194
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,793
something, just don't put a bank.
[Background Chatter]

195
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:56,170
- Okay. So, how would the government fix
that?

196
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:04,102
- [Student] ...They could be like "We're not
going to let you buy it." The bank buy

197
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:05,940
that lot, they could have said no.

198
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,080
- So, they might limit, they might say how
many of these business could be. That's a

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,130
new one. I've never heard of that, but
obviously there's something there to that

200
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,000
because you're saying it's taking away
from the enjoyment of people in the

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,923
community. It is maybe adding to the
wealth of the community with the

202
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:26,816
employment and the income that's being
raised, but overall... True, no. I think

203
00:13:26,816 --> 00:13:29,343
you've got something there but it's a
different lens. Andrew?

204
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:33,184
- I think that a better example for that
would be parking lots because then it's

205
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:37,471
just there and not doing anything, whereas
for a bank it increases the competition

206
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:43,327
and it increases the rate of...
[Background Chatter].

207
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:53,090
- [Student] The parking garage closer to
the Y encourages people to go down to the

208
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:58,623
retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of
does encourage people to...

209
00:13:58,623 --> 00:13:59,775
[Background Chatter]

210
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,030
- All right. I like what you guys are
going with this, either one of you could

211
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,400
make an argument with it. That kind of
brings up another point, though. This is

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,140
somewhat of, Alex, are you with me? This
is somewhat of a, this is somewhat of an

213
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,030
opinion, right? Because, now you're saying
that there's certain things, that there's

214
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,950
definite, and those are going to be our
perfect examples like pollution. No one in

215
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,880
their right mind can argue that pollution
gives a benefit to society. They can argue

216
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,770
that what they produce that produces
pollution is helping industrialize, I

217
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:35,640
mean, talk to China. One example. Their
massive pollution, few regulations at all

218
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:42,210
because they're trying to compete with
other countries and step up, but they're

219
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,710
not, they definitely would say it's worth
it. But pollution itself, no one can say

220
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,780
that it's good. Andrew mentioned something
about the beauty of something. What are

221
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,000
some things that people buy or do--
