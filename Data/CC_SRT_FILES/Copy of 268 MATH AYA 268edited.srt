[Background Chatter]

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,657
- [Student] We started
testing out our theory

3
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:06,829
that it's an exponential.

4
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:08,950
- 'Cause we found out that the ratios...

5
00:00:11,973 --> 00:00:13,352
- [Teacher] Does that verify

6
00:00:13,352 --> 00:00:14,692
that it's an exponential equation?

7
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,684
- We thought it did but it doesn't.

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,774
- [Teacher] So why aren't you sure?

9
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:22,776
- I don't know.

10
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,309
- [Teacher] So the more disks I add,

11
00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:27,249
I'm eventually gonna have a cap

12
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:28,072
on the minimum number

13
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,472
of moves that I can make.

14
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,625
- Isn't that a logistic function?

15
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:34,936
- [Teacher] So logistic function

16
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,386
would say that you're gonna have a cap

17
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:38,017
on the minimum number of moves you make.

18
00:00:38,017 --> 00:00:39,597
And it would say at some point

19
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:40,927
you're gonna slow down

20
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:42,330
the number of moves you're adding on.

21
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,410
Does that make sense based

22
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,460
on what you've done so far?

23
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:46,172
- No, not at all.

24
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,292
- [Teacher] What do you think
is gonna happen instead?

25
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,728
- That it would increase.

26
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:52,378
- [Teacher] And what would that be?

27
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:54,278
- That's the exponential.

28
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:59,218
- But the numbers are
all really long decimals.

29
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:03,583
- [Teacher] So, I heard
someone in here earlier

30
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,833
say you were gonna scatter plot this.

31
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:07,453
So have you looked at your scatter plot?

32
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,054
- [Student] Yes

33
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:09,915
- [Teacher] Okay.

34
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,756
What might be other ways

35
00:01:14,756 --> 00:01:17,016
to change an exponential function?

36
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,220
- [Student] I can get it out of my backpack.

37
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:41,135
- [Teacher] Based on what you had before

38
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,735
what was your gut instinct

39
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,965
with your ratio?

40
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:46,531
Before you did any of the arithmetic,

41
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,311
what did you think your ratio might be?

42
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,092
- Small?

43
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:52,488
I don't know.

44
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,798
I didn't really think it
was two automatically.

45
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,748
- [Teacher] But two's in your head.

46
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:57,918
Why is two in your head?

47
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,598
- [Student] Because doubling?

48
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:07,223
- Because there's doubling.

49
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:08,901
- [Teacher] Here's what I'm gonna suggest

50
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:09,660
to you guys.

51
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,581
You've got your scatter plot

52
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:13,801
on Marissa's calculator, right?

53
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:15,771
You're thinking that two

54
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:17,101
might have been the ratio.

55
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,681
Why don't you graph

56
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,191
two y equals two to the X

57
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,592
and compare it to what's happening

58
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:22,522
on your scatter plot

59
00:02:22,522 --> 00:02:23,832
and see if there's a different way

60
00:02:23,832 --> 00:02:24,902
that you might be able

61
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,302
to change the extremum.

62
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:42,121
- [Student] It's increasing
by a factor of 2.

63
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,037
She's trying it in an actual game.

64
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,286
- [Teacher] Normally I'd want you guys

65
00:02:58,286 --> 00:02:59,552
to struggle with it right now

66
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:00,992
but it sounds ...

67
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,237
We're at 20 so what's your goal?

68
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:10,132
- 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

69
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,093
- Good job, Caitlyn.

70
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,470
- [Teacher] Good job.

71
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,507
Now I'm convinced that that works.

72
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:20,254
You're seeing that the difference

73
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:21,798
is doubling each time, correct?

74
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:24,387
What kind of function is that suggesting?

75
00:04:24,387 --> 00:04:25,277
- Exponential.

76
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,588
- [Teacher] And what do you suspect

77
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,928
is probably your factor?

78
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:35,088
- [Student] Two?

79
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,655
- [Teacher] Two?

80
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,335
So that's what I want you to look at.

81
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:42,799
How could you verify

82
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,199
that it's an exponential function

83
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,229
using any of the tools you have here?

84
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,179
Once you've found out this was

85
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:49,359
an exponential function

86
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,479
what did you do to figure out

87
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,309
what the function actually is? 
There is a little bit of a trick to this one.

88
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:57,163
It has to do with some of the other

89
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,133
types of changes we do to functions.

90
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:01,546
Okay?

91
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:03,320
Figure out that.

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,296
When you get stuck again, let me know

93
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,105
and I'll be back.

94
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:13,642
- [Student] So you think that's two

95
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:14,822
to the power of X minus one?

96
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,927
- [Student] Why did you get minus one?

97
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,257
- Because with one it worked fine

98
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,327
but with two,

99
00:05:25,457 --> 00:05:27,827
when you try to put in

100
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,158
X as the exponent,

101
00:05:32,428 --> 00:05:34,658
two to the X so two times two is four.

102
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:41,785
So far X minus 1 is the exponent.

103
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:44,394
- [Teacher] What I'm hearing is

104
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:47,705
that you're convinced
that the factor is two.

105
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,694
And you're trying to
do some transformations

106
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,291
on this to make your y values fit

107
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,441
with what you got here, is that correct?

108
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,671
Talk me through again

109
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,611
why you guys think

110
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,670
that the exponent is x minus one

111
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,910
and then why you're adding

112
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,220
the one at the end?

113
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:07,058
(students laugh)

114
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:11,177
- Because there has to
be at least one move.

115
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:12,933
- [Student] We added the one at the end

116
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:16,023
because we were looking at
just the y values first.

117
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,181
- Oh wait, that doesn't work though.

118
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:25,942
If you have one,

119
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:30,015
so two to the zero is 1.

120
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:31,658
And one plus one is two

121
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,668
but that's ...

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,339
- Tell me more about this idea

123
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:37,679
of the plus one at the end.

124
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,819
You said that had something to do

125
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,629
with why you had to have a plus one.

126
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,193
- Is it a piece of the function?

127
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:47,888
That would be really mean.

128
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,315
- We were like well it has to double

129
00:06:58,315 --> 00:07:00,151
and then we have to add one on the end.

130
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,887
- [Teacher] I think you
guys are in a great place.

131
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,810
I think you've got a good idea here

132
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,411
which is to take y equals two to the x

133
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:06,790
and find the transformation

134
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,780
that gives you this table.

135
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,890
So try more with the transformation.

136
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,510
I also like this idea you guys have

137
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,400
about how you have to have at least one move,

138
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,470
but I would think a little bit more about

139
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:20,454
how to pattern your moves,

140
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,404
that's just that you
need at least one move.

141
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:30,169
Alright, I'm going to
leave you guys to think.

142
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,299
I'll come back.

143
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:34,485
- [Student] So we found the equation

144
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:37,155
but now we're stuck at number four.

145
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:38,985
- [Teacher] Okay, so talk to me

146
00:07:38,985 --> 00:07:39,825
about the equation

147
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,255
and tell me how you found it.

148
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,967
- [Student] The difference between...

149
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,219
- [Student] I was kinda thinking of

150
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,461
how this was relating to the difference,

151
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,761
so how it would relate to the y values.

152
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,841
- We saw the two to the x,

153
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:09,929
we figured "oh well, two to the four

154
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:13,441
to the 16. Well how do
we get to 15, minus one?"

155
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:17,844
- [Teacher] This is going back

156
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,717
to the algebra from last year.

157
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:21,267
So you saw that you had two to the x.

158
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:23,538
You noticed here that we have just

159
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:27,728
two to the x and then you go
back one using algebra.

160
00:08:27,932 --> 00:08:29,262
You also talked about how

161
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,900
when you graphed two to the x

162
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,540
it matched up with your scatter plot.

163
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,340
Did it lie directly on your scatter plot?

164
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,490
- No.

165
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,950
- [Teacher] So what do
you mean by it matched up?

166
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,630
- It was close.

167
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:39,825
- It was the same curve.

168
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,431
- [Teacher] So how did you know

169
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:42,921
that created a transformation?

170
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:47,203
- [Student] Because whether it depends

171
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:51,513
on the number or which value it is.
It changed the steepness of it.

172
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,721
So we just knew it transformed it somehow.

173
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:01,031
Like we had to have it.

174
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,078
It wasn't the parent function.

175
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:04,358
- [Teacher] So what made you guys think

176
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,079
about doing a minus 1

177
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,859
after two to the x instead

178
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:09,789
of saying four times two to the x

179
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:10,859
or three to the x?

180
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:11,779
How did you know that?

181
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:13,939
Because if you'd done
four times two to the x,

182
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:14,935
you would have stretched it.

183
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:15,954
- [Student] Because it would have moved

184
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:16,673
to the left too...

185
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:17,583
on the graph.

186
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:19,684
- [Teacher] And what did that end up doing

187
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,994
to your y-intercept?

188
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,205
Okay, so that would be
my next question for you.

189
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:29,655
I agree with you guys

190
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,445
that definitely there's a transformation.

191
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,365
I agree with your algebra

192
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:33,585
and your understanding of tables,

193
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,995
you've done a nice job with that.

194
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:38,435
So how does a transformation,

195
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:39,865
what you've done is you've taken

196
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,516
two to the x, what does the minus one do?

197
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,046
Does that move this to the left?

198
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:45,156
Move it up or down?

199
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,829
- [Student] Well if you graph it...

200
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,204
- It moves it up.

201
00:10:13,394 --> 00:10:14,144
- [Teacher] Okay.

202
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,651
So Jamie is saying that she thinks

203
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,671
that changing the a value

204
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,131
changed the slope of the function.

205
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,071
And you're saying

206
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,801
that you don't think the slope changes.

207
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,772
Okay, so you change the y-intercept.

208
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:35,562
And do you have a change
in the y-intercept?

209
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:40,362
- It's still zero comma zero.

210
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:53,998
- [Teacher] So you just
had two to the x.

211
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,618
Find out just two to the x.

212
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,338
What's the y-intercept of the graph?

213
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:11,749
What happened to your function

214
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,069
and how did the function get transformed

215
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:14,399
to achieve that?

216
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,519
- The y-intercept moved down.

217
00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:17,799
- [Teacher] And does that match

218
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,969
what we've been talking about?

219
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,800
You take the function and subtract the value

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,030
and move down one?

221
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,840
Alright you guys said you were stuck

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,890
on number four?

223
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,311
- Yeah.

224
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:28,811
- [Teacher] Okay. Why are you stuck?

225
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:29,973
- So we figured out that you put

226
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:31,563
64 for x.

227
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:37,024
But the minus one doesn't do anything.

228
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,211
- [Teacher] Yeah, the numbers are so big

229
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:41,211
that it doesn't matter.

230
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:43,455
It actually does
change the actual number

231
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:45,105
a little teeny, tiny bit.

232
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,425
But our calculator can't see that number.
It looks like the same number on your calculator.

233
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:55,061
- [Student] So we have a number of moves.

234
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:01,116
- [Teacher] If each move is a second,

235
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:02,508
then how long is it gonna take

236
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:03,916
for the world to end?

237
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:05,243
Alright, now you guys are also

238
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,453
at the challenge question down here.

239
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,943
Which is, based on the patterns

240
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:10,863
you were seeing

241
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,323
and how the pieces were moved.

242
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:13,893
Why is your function which is correct

243
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,699
match the way the patterns that were made?

244
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,469
Okay? And I'll be back in a little bit.

245
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:18,440
I'm going to give you guys

246
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,850
about seven more minutes.

247
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,946
You should answer question four

248
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:31,197
before you try that.

249
00:12:31,197 --> 00:12:32,928
(students laugh)

250
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:36,707
- [Student] So I got it kind of close.

251
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:39,417
Looking at just...

252
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:43,046
I did what you do to find a normal

253
00:12:43,046 --> 00:12:44,876
exponential equation.

254
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:49,106
I plugged in y-two over y-one

255
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,426
and then to the square root of four.

256
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,206
- [Teacher] And are you
getting consistent ratios

257
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:57,257
between those y values of yours?

258
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:57,957
- No.

259
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,069
- [Teacher] You guys are correct

260
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:00,353
that this is exponential.

261
00:13:00,353 --> 00:13:02,273
But if we're not getting
a consistent ratio

262
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:03,973
between y values then that suggests

263
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:05,253
that your original thought,

264
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,753
which was to start with two to the x

265
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,344
and do a transformation,
is on the right track.

266
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:10,914
So I really think you need to go back

267
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,054
to y equals two to the x

268
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,874
and find the transformation

269
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:16,525
that gets you to these y values.

270
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,799
- Okay.

271
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,969
- [Teacher] I'm gonna make a suggestion

272
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,579
to you again stealing from another group.

273
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,382
Try finding the differences

274
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:26,683
between all these y values

275
00:13:26,683 --> 00:13:27,983
and see if you can see a pattern

276
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:29,104
between the differences

277
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:30,994
and the actual y values you have.

278
00:13:32,614 --> 00:13:33,804
Alright, what have you guys got?

279
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:37,824
- [Student] Our answer was 30.

280
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:40,304
- Talk me through how
you got that function

281
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:42,585
and how you know it works.

282
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:45,085
- I realized that...

283
00:13:47,978 --> 00:13:49,258
the table matches the graph

284
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:53,269
of two to the x but minus one.

285
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:56,213
- [Teacher] So you just
have that in your head.

286
00:13:56,213 --> 00:13:57,313
Did you graph it

287
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:59,743
or did you just know
those numbers in you head?

288
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,017
- We didn't graph it.

289
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:06,868
We used the tables to confirm

290
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,258
that it was y equals
two to the x minus one.

291
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,459
Went to the table and
it was the same numbers.

292
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,993
- And I noticed here you've got

293
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,883
2 to the 64th minus one.

294
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:23,463
What's that for?

295
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,663
- That's from another number.

296
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,381
It's like a really high number.

297
00:14:31,431 --> 00:14:34,181
One point eight times
10 to the negative 19th.

298
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:38,519
- Two to the 19th.

299
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,950
- [Teacher] While you guys figure out

300
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,410
how long it's gonna take
for the world to end

301
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,710
with that really huge number,

302
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,990
I'd also like you to think

303
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,490
about the answer to the challenge.

304
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,070
You guys spent a lot of time looking

305
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,540
at the patterns and how
these pieces are moved.

306
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,070
So I'd like you to think about

307
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,130
why your function has two to the x.

308
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,052
Why are you doubling those?
