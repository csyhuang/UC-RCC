1
00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:01,140
- [Male student] So our question was:

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,952
What are the reasons
why Holden has a sudden

3
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:05,192
acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up.

4
00:00:05,192 --> 00:00:07,851
And I got this question because,

5
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:11,055
I feel like the carousel
represents growing up

6
00:00:11,055 --> 00:00:13,353
because (drowned out by
other voices) you have

7
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,917
to let people grab towards
something they want

8
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:18,837
or else if you're not letting
them experience the world

9
00:00:18,837 --> 00:00:22,478
to its full extent then
you're just sheltering them

10
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:26,878
and they're just going
to live a sheltered life.

11
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:30,720
So they can't really do all the things

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:41,330
that they have the
possibility of experiencing.

13
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,367
- Yeah, I agree with him,
with Damon because I think

14
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:48,212
the carousel symbolizes
the ride through life.

15
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:50,685
Because it never really
stops, just continuously

16
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,333
goes around and around.

17
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:56,177
And the goal is to grab the golden hoop.

18
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:59,357
And I think that symbolizes,
I don't know, happiness

19
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:01,679
because everybody tries
for it and they keep trying

20
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,092
even though they fall,
they keep getting back up

21
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:06,717
on that carousel and trying to grab it.

22
00:01:06,717 --> 00:01:10,199
And if you hold a kid back from trying

23
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,870
to grab what he wants, it's just like no,

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,962
I'm not going to let you go out there

25
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:18,085
and try to get what you want.

26
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:21,149
They're sheltering them from
their own happiness, kind of.

27
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:31,087
Because (inaudible)

28
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:36,207
- I also agree with Brandon,
but I also think that,

29
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:44,595
let's just say Phoebe was on
the carousel and she fell off.

30
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:47,816
I don't know if Holden would go to her,

31
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,550
but I think based on
his character he would.

32
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,841
But then I think that
would be bad just because,

33
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:56,199
like Brandon was saying, if
you don't let them fall,

34
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,785
if you don't let them
make their own mistakes

35
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,700
then they're not gonna learn from life.

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,579
So like my dad, he's so overprotective.

37
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:07,609
I think pretty much all parents
are really overprotective

38
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:13,448
of their kids, but you should
just let them go out there

39
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:16,362
and experience the world
and learn from themselves.

40
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:18,638
Not necessarily, because
I think that's their fear,

41
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,885
learning from their mistakes.

42
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:25,603
So I just think it's better
if you just let them go

43
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,587
like a little bit at a time just so

44
00:02:28,587 --> 00:02:38,456
they can just figure out things in life.

45
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:42,308
- I think people have a hard
time letting go of any child,

46
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:45,872
whether it's their brother,
their sister, their actual child

47
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:48,206
because it means that they're leaving soon

48
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:51,387
and they're actually going
to experience their own lives

49
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:54,231
and then when it comes to a parent

50
00:02:54,231 --> 00:02:57,528
or an older brother or
sister, they don't want you

51
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,931
to experience the same
thing that they did too,

52
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,984
so they're like telling you what to do

53
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:06,548
and it seems like they're telling
you how to live your life,

54
00:03:06,548 --> 00:03:12,028
but they're giving you advice.

55
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:16,171
- I think parents, the reason
that they're so protective

56
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,992
is because they know that
saying ignorance is bliss,

57
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:20,165
because it really is,

58
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:24,983
and innocence is in a way, you
know, because you don't know.

59
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:27,444
And so they just want
their child to be happy

60
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:31,484
but inadvertently they're
actually making them sad

61
00:03:31,484 --> 00:03:36,290
if they just won't relax
so they can (inaudible)

62
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,784
- And also, I think a lot of
kids don't understand this

63
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,304
but part of the reason why our parents

64
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:43,407
have such a hard time letting go

65
00:03:43,407 --> 00:03:45,264
is because you were part of their lives

66
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:47,505
for as many years as you've been born.

67
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,687
They preciously try to take care of you

68
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,567
and they may seem like they're trying

69
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,168
to shield you from everything,

70
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,629
but they're just trying to look
out for what's best for you.

71
00:03:56,629 --> 00:03:58,452
But you can't think of it like,

72
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:01,653
oh, once this one chance goes
by, I'll never have it again.

73
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:03,197
Because it really is like a carousel.

74
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:04,788
You're gonna keep going on

75
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:09,902
and you will have another chance.

76
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:13,245
- Going back to the
carousel I also thought

77
00:04:13,245 --> 00:04:15,707
that the carousel, it may just seem

78
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:18,365
that there are a bunch of
different people on it.

79
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:20,698
So I think Holden kind of realized

80
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:23,740
that even though the carousel,

81
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,680
he knows have different people on it,

82
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,567
you kind of have to
allow the kids to grow up

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,924
because you can't always
keep them the same

84
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:34,536
like the carousel, it's not
a real machine or something.

85
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:39,447
We all have to grow up eventually.

86
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,023
- Just listening to you guys,
what do you think about,

87
00:04:42,023 --> 00:04:45,425
when I was home in Los Angeles,

88
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:49,082
my nephew at that time
was about six months old.

89
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,961
And at that point in
time he was just crawling

90
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,482
and putting everything in his mouth

91
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,026
and stuff like that, like leaves.

92
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,476
You'd show him an apple
and he's like, "Ahh."

93
00:04:57,476 --> 00:04:59,240
And then he puts a leaf in his mouth.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,215
And you're just like, "Holy!"

95
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,525
You have to dig it out kind of a thing.

96
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,300
So in one respect, I mean, it's just like

97
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,877
there's this idea of let
people figure out things

98
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:09,758
on their own, but in that respect,

99
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:13,218
he'll die if you let him figure
out oh, you can't eat that.

100
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:16,821
So I'm just trying to think
as far as a parent goes,

101
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:23,425
how does a parent know when
to let them figure it out

102
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:29,162
versus how does a parent
when to protect them?

103
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,460
And I think that's part of
the conflict Holden is having,

104
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,922
he's trying to figure out
how he can protect people

105
00:05:33,922 --> 00:05:38,126
and what he should protect them against.

106
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:41,758
- Me and my grandpa talk
to me and he was like,

107
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,108
"I know that I have to let you go."

108
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,363
And I think that they
know when to let you go

109
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:47,185
by how responsible you are.

110
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:49,403
Like if you do what you're supposed to do

111
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:53,226
and you show them that you're working

112
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:56,345
or doing what you said then
they want to let you go

113
00:05:56,345 --> 00:06:03,751
because they know that you
(inaudible)

114
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:06,665
- That's true, and I also think that

115
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,893
it's not really based on yourself mostly.

116
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:13,689
It's based on your parents
and how they've grown

117
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,832
and how with having kids
you grow up as a parent

118
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:20,874
and you know and it's just nature,

119
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,825
you just know when they're ready.

120
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,390
That's what I think.

121
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,503
I don't think really it's just based

122
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,004
on all of their mistakes.

123
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:33,807
I just think it's pretty
much based on (inaudible)

124
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,404
- [Teacher] Interesting.

125
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:39,643
- I think when people
start changing and stuff,

126
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:43,799
like their attitude, because
I've noticed my little brother,

127
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,120
he's starting to change
and he has an attitude now.

128
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,278
He's starting to get a
little rebellious and stuff,

129
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:54,120
and I think that's when parents
have to start letting loose

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,319
on their kids cause we have to
experience things on our own,

131
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,163
and it's not just being
told what to do and stuff.

132
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:10,882
You have to have that
experience to learn from.

133
00:07:10,882 --> 00:07:12,485
- Every person has their own free will.

134
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:16,200
Like the saying you can
take a horse to the water

135
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,883
but you can't make it drink.

136
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:20,924
You can enforce your rules on your child

137
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:25,522
as much as you want but you
can't force them to do anything,

138
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,681
you can just have an influence on them.

139
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:31,604
And that's something that
parents have to understand.

140
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:34,205
You can't force your kids
to do their homework,

141
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:38,918
but you can ground them if they don't.

142
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,544
- All right guys, I want
you guys to keep going.

143
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,601
You guys are doing a great job.

144
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,864
I can see your notes are
also looking pretty good.

145
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,582
I'm gonna move on to another group, okay?

146
00:07:45,582 --> 00:07:46,918
But keep this going
because I think you guys

147
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,343
can come up with a lot more, okay?

148
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,516
Thank you guys.

149
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:52,419
You guys are doing an
awesome job with your volume,

150
00:07:52,419 --> 00:08:05,143
we're gonna come over to 
this group over here.

151
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:06,524
- All right, can you fill me in

152
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:07,604
on what you guys talked about

153
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:13,745
making sure we have the volume up.

154
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,684
- We have a couple of
questions, we have like -

155
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:16,741
(voices talking over each other)

156
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,180
- Oh, okay. Let's just come up with,

157
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,445
tell me about the one that you guys

158
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,697
are the most excited about.

159
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,602
- The first question is my question,

160
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,285
which was what are the reasons why

161
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,595
people live their lives
through other people.

162
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,138
And I kind of came up with that question

163
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:32,784
because Holden, he kind of
was denied of his childhood

164
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:36,966
because Allie died and so
that really impacted him.

165
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,470
And since that he's kind of been trying

166
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:43,627
to preserve the innocence of Phoebe.

167
00:08:43,627 --> 00:08:45,241
Like making her go back to the carousel

168
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,145
even though she says she's too big for it.

169
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:48,862
He's like, "No, you're not."

170
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:55,050
He's trying to help to
her keep that innocence,

171
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,604
or just children in
general keep that innocence

172
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:01,505
that he was denied.

173
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,943
- It kind of was a parent
versus child kind of thing.

174
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,486
It goes against like parent versus child.

175
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:10,489
So a parent when they have a child,

176
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:13,288
they kind of want to live
their life through their child.

177
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:15,389
And they make them do all these chores

178
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,129
to get into (inaudible)

179
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:21,101
because they never got to
do it when they were little

180
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:22,842
because they were
deprived and their parents

181
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,409
probably didn't want them to do it.

182
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,546
So they kind of (inaudible).

183
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,299
- [Teacher] Interesting.

184
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:34,507
- I said that I just think
this whole concept of

185
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,749
the identity is not yet established,

186
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,532
and you have the father
and have somebody else

187
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:48,729
create their footsteps (inaudible)

188
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:49,844
I had these two other questions

189
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:53,697
because I was reading the book where

190
00:09:53,697 --> 00:09:55,833
I was wondering why, I was
trying to get more in depth

191
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:58,806
with why Holden wanted his job

192
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:07,211
to be catching children in the rye.

193
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,254
- Okay, so I kind of answered it

194
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:12,226
and I said it's very in tune because

195
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:15,186
when you fall off the cliff
you can't get back up.

196
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:16,672
Just like when you lose your innocence,

197
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:21,212
you can't get it back because
this experience happened.

198
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:26,284
If you get exposed to it, you
can't magically forget it.

199
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:28,548
It just stays with you
and that's a part of you

200
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:29,988
that's just lost.

201
00:10:29,988 --> 00:10:33,492
- [Teacher] Interesting.

202
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:35,386
- That kind of relates
back to the question about

203
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:39,251
(inaudible)

204
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:45,230
It seems like Holden is kind
of holding onto his past,

205
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,226
and so he's still living
in that innocent stage,

206
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,790
and when he's living an innocent stage

207
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,323
he can't make a wrong decision,

208
00:10:52,323 --> 00:10:54,923
which is very hard from
his now because he's 16,

209
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:57,767
he keeps transferring
to all these schools,

210
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:01,285
and he can't really
grow up because he still

211
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:07,369
has that memory and so
that's why he's confused

212
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:09,226
about his identity.

213
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:14,670
- [Teacher] Good point.

214
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,249
- Going back to the first question

215
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:18,548
about why people live their
lives through other people,

216
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:21,764
it kind of goes through influences too.

217
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,051
Like he was talking about James Castle,

218
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:28,126
and when he died he said
that James liked to digress

219
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:30,505
on a topic and have speeches

220
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:33,883
and it kind of made him
think about, oh yeah,

221
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:37,099
that's a pretty great idea.

222
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:42,949
It's not bad, but why would
people be waiting for that?

223
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:46,213
It was actually like
a digression off topic

224
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:51,309
makes you think of new ideas.

225
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,654
- And I think going back
to that question again,

226
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:57,554
that sometimes parents want
the best for their child,

227
00:11:57,554 --> 00:12:00,514
so they convince their, what
they want their child to be.

228
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:02,256
(inaudible)

229
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,602
If that makes sense.

230
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:07,108
And at the end, sometimes
you can't force the child

231
00:12:07,108 --> 00:12:11,926
to do what they don't want to do.

232
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:14,028
- So in a way it's kind
of like you guys said,

233
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:15,629
the parent versus the child.

234
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:19,090
They wanna form their
own identity as a teen,

235
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,912
but at the same time
the parents are so busy

236
00:12:20,912 --> 00:12:21,933
trying to protect them.

237
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:26,268
Is that what we're kind of
getting at through everything?

238
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:28,030
They're so busy trying to protect them

239
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,583
that they just gotta learn to let go.

240
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,697
Is that what we're saying?

241
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:35,128
- Yeah, kind of.

242
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:42,331
Like Holden says he's trying
to protect that innocence,

243
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:47,138
because he's always referring
to (inaudible)

244
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:49,333
There's a part where he's
walking down the sidewalk

245
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:54,058
and he called Allie to help
him cross to the other side.

246
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:56,878
And that's kind of interesting

247
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,211
because usually you don't
think an adult would say that.

248
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,860
A child would say that.

249
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,472
And it's because he's mad at his parents

250
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:06,793
because they won't talk about it,

251
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,276
so he's kind of just living with this.

252
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:10,449
- [Teacher] Interesting.

253
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:12,272
So he's just trying to
find a way of coping?

254
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,407
Is that possible?

255
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:19,272
- Yes.

256
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:21,547
And then there was
another kind of question

257
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:27,909
about where Holden comes to (inaudible)

258
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,214
Kiana said-

259
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:34,051
- Why do people feel the
need to forget the deaths

260
00:13:34,051 --> 00:13:35,257
and move on?

261
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:38,716
And I thought of this question because

262
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:41,353
when Holden was inside just his room,

263
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,313
Phoebe was getting all frustrated
with him because she was

264
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,566
like, "You don't like anything!
You don't like anything!"

265
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:47,819
And he was trying to make
up stuff that he did like.

266
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:51,150
Like he did say he liked
Allie, and she'll say he's dead

267
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,729
so pick something else.

268
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,702
And he was arguing with her saying that

269
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,781
just because he's dead
you don't forget him,

270
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:59,008
and you can still like someone who's dead.

271
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:03,849
And he thinks that Allie is
thousand times better than,

272
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:07,543
nicer than, people who
are alive today, now.

273
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:12,859
So that just proves how
he's holding on to that

274
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:16,783
and he's not planning on forgetting that,

275
00:14:16,783 --> 00:14:20,439
and he holds that near
and dear to his heart.

276
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:22,668
And so that's probably why he
doesn't like a lot of people,

277
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:25,408
because he compares them to how Allie was

278
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:30,307
and his innocence, his maturity
level, how it was then,

279
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:32,293
and how he sees how people today,

280
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,753
because kids don't
understand he's holding on,

281
00:14:34,753 --> 00:14:41,592
so he doesn't really
understand what's going on.

282
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:43,588
- [Teacher] Anything
else to add on to this?

283
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:45,144
- No.

284
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:46,850
- [Teacher] I like what
you guys are doing.

285
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,765
I like how you're tying
in the death of Allie

286
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:52,086
with the catcher in the
rye type of a thing.

287
00:14:52,086 --> 00:14:55,035
What about the carousel, first of all?

288
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:59,493
- I don't know, it sounds like it goes

289
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:02,859
with the whole keeping the
innocence going and all.

290
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,681
'Cause I know he would
probably ride it too.

291
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:07,398
Did he ride it?

292
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:08,872
- I was thinking of repetition,

293
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:12,135
because how the parents feel,
it rotates around and round.

294
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,434
And whenever Phoebe passed by,

295
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:16,557
he would tell her how pretty she looked.

296
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:18,299
She was never changing.

297
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,005
That's kind of what he wanted,

298
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:23,964
he wanted her to stay in that
stage, and nothing to change.

299
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,751
- [Teacher] Nice. All right, guys.

300
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:26,948
I'm gonna check on another group.

301
00:15:26,948 --> 00:15:28,225
I want you guys to keep going with this,

302
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:29,884
you guys are tearing it apart.

303
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,545
Good job looking at the symbolism

304
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:33,699
and tying everything together.

305
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,324
All right, and your notes
look good as well too.

306
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:37,532
I like it.

307
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,427
I think you guys could
explore the carousel

308
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,331
and tie that in a little more.

309
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,468
Okay, hi guys!

310
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,91
You guys, the volume is doing really well.

311
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:50,050
(background chatter)

312
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,188
So you guys fill me in.
