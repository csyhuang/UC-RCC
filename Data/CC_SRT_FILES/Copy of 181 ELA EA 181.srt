1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:09,260
- In my opinion I think the grandpa shows the most
leadership because he stands up for

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:17,970
himself, telling the principal, "I should
not pay $15.00 because then it wouldn't be

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,880
a scholarship."

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,510
- [Teacher] Okay, thank you very much. I
like the way the way you show, you know,

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,410
how much he pays for one day and not have
to pay for the scholarship jacket. Thank

6
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,220
you very much.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,170
- I agree with Julia, because you should
not choose people for, like, what kind of

8
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:41,210
races they are or their culture. You
should choose them for what they've been

9
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,500
through like their hardest work or
something.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,330
- [Teacher] Okay. So you mean they had
jobs, they had work it was right to feel

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:57,320
that. Very good, good job. Okay.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,950
- I think Martha because she earned the
jacket instead of buying it.

13
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,000
- [Teacher] Okay.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,850
- In my opinion the grandpa showed the
greatest leadership because he was wise,

15
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,990
and a great leader is wise.

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,530
- [Teacher] Okay.

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,500
- I agree with Alejandro that the
grandfather is the leader because he

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,270
didn't pay for the jacket.

19
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,800
- [Teacher] He didn't pay for the jacket.
So you thought because he didn't pay for

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,520
the jacket then he's a great leader. You
think you know just because he did not pay

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,830
for the jacket that's what made him a
great leader.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,860
- No, I think that what makes him a great
leader is that he stood up for himself

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,530
instead of just saying, oh, okay, here's
the money.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,510
- [Teacher] Okay, so a greater leader
should stand for what he believes. Is that

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,880
what you are saying?
- Yes.

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,090
- [Teacher] Very good. Thank you very much
for clarifying that. Go ahead, Daniel.

27
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,090
- I was going to say that I agree with
Jennifer.

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,830
I think that a great leader should stand
up for what they believe.

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:12,730
- [Teacher] Thank you very much. Go ahead.

30
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,790
- In my opinion, I think Martha showed the
greatest leadership because she showed

31
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,370
wisdom because she earned that jacket by
getting straight As and being a good

32
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,690
student.

33
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,183
- [Teacher] All right. Thank you. Go
ahead, Lisette.

34
00:02:25,183 --> 00:02:31,100
- In my opinion, Martha's grandpa is a
great leader because a leader needs to be

35
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,190
a strong person like Martha's grandpa.

36
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:40,200
- [Teacher] Very good. So you need to
stand your ground. Very good.

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,150
- I think that the person who showed the
most leadership was Martha. Even though

38
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:58,910
she thought she was going to lose what she
had earned, she believed that even though

39
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:06,920
the teachers, they, they, some wanted to
give it to someone else, but some knew

40
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,400
that she had earned it and she, she spoke
up, not keeping it quiet and keeping it to

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,000
herself.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,140
- [Teacher] Okay. So you feel a great
leader, you know, she speak up, you know,

43
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,900
when something is wrong or in the way.

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,100
- She shouldn't just keep it.

45
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,930
- [Teacher] Very good.
- She has to tell someone.

46
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,640
- [Teacher] Very good, good job. Go ahead.

47
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:34,160
- It seems to me that Martha showed great
leadership because she did all the things

48
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,870
that she did so she could win the jacket.

49
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,587
- [Teacher] Okay, what are some of the
other things, you know, that Martha did.

50
00:03:45,587 --> 00:03:51,270
- She got, she got, since she was in first
grade she got good grades and she tried

51
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,160
not to get in trouble, and be a good
student.

52
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,430
- [Teacher] Okay, so that means, you know,
she has worked hard all this time. Very

53
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,350
good. Thank you.
Okay, go ahead.

54
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,630
- I believe that Martha showed very good
leadership because she wanted the

55
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,880
scholarship jacket so bad that she didn't
give up on trying to get it.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,700
- [Teacher] So a good leader, you know,
she'll try to do whatever it takes, you

57
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,660
know, to get what he or she wants. Is that
what you're saying?

58
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:24,910
- Yes.

59
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,020
- [Teacher] All right. Good job. Thank
you.

60
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,010
- In my opinion I think Mr. Schmidt is a
great leader because he was fair, you

61
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:42,170
know, to fight for Martha and not the
other girl.

62
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,030
- [Teacher] Thank you. Who is the other
girl?

63
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,560
- [together] Joanne.
- [Teacher] Huh?

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,300
- [together] Joanne.

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,920
- [Teacher] Okay, so Mr. Schmidt was fair
enough, you know, to fight for Martha

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,640
instead of who?
- [together] Joanne.

67
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,000
- [Teacher] Joanne. Thank you very much.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,460
- In my opinion it's Martha because she
fight for the jacket and she tried her

69
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,760
best.
- [Teacher] All right.

70
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,670
- In my opinion I think Mr. Smith because
even though Martha was poor he still said

71
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,310
that she deserved the sweater because of
her good grades.

72
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,900
- [Teacher] Because of her good grades.
Good job.

73
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,480
- In my opinion I believe that the one
that showed leadership was Mr. Smith

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,910
because he was honest and fair to Martha.

75
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,480
- [Teacher] Very, very good. Thank you
very much.

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:31,570
- I agree with her because Mr. Booney just
wanted the person that had money, which is

77
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:38,330
Joanne. Her father owned the only store in
town. So, Mr. Schmidt was actually being

78
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:38,570
fair.

79
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:43,900
- [Teacher] Okay. Thank you for adding on
to that. Now who is Joanne's dad? You

80
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,380
know, because everybody was saying I could
hear Juan, you know, when Juan said

81
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,010
because of Joanne's dad. Who is Joanne's
dad? How can we describe him?

82
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,560
- He owns the only store in town.
- [Teacher] Hmm?

83
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,410
- He owns the only store in town.

84
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,890
- He owns the only store in town. What
else?

85
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,620
- He's also part of the school board.

86
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,660
- He's rich.
- School board.

87
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:06,960
- [Teacher] Huh?

88
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,820
- He's part of the school board so they
had the decisions like, in the school,

89
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,710
like, what they do and stuff.

90
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,340
-[inaudible] 
-In the story he gives money to the 
school so maybe that's also why they

91
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,660
wanted to pick Joanne so they got more
money.
-[inaudible]

92
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:27,990
- [Teacher] Very good. Thank you very
much. Now that everybody has contributed,

93
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:35,780
now let's look at the next question. The
next question is this: what does Martha

94
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,860
represent to you? Think about the
leadership qualities that Martha showed.

95
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,220
What does Martha represent to you? Not
only the leadership qualities, all the

96
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,460
other things that Martha represents, okay?
Anybody can start. Anybody can start. Just

97
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,390
jump in.

98
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,960
- I believe that Martha to me represents a
great leader. Her experience and triumph

99
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,050
illustrate importance in leadership such as
never giving up.

100
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,990
- [Teacher] Thank you for sharing that.

101
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,490
- She represents someone who will find the
truth and will solve it. She stood up for

102
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,510
herself and she listened to what her
grandfather had to say.

103
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,680
- [Teacher] Very good.

104
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,610
- It seems to me that she was a smart and
outgoing girl because she worked hard and

105
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,340
speaked up and no matter how you look or
where you live you have to be treated

106
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:28,910
fairly.

107
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,110
- [Teacher] Great. Like that. Anybody can
jump in.

108
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:46,220
- It seems to me that Martha is not a
leader because her grandpa speaked up for

109
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,400
her about the scholarship jacket.

110
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,160
- I disagree because Martha did speak up
for herself. Her grandfather just told her

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,000
what to say.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,470
- I disagree because like,
her grandfather gave her most of her

113
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,940
ideas. If it wasn't for her grandfather
she probably would've tried to get the

114
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,990
money. But like her father said, I mean
her grandfather said that a scholarship is

115
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,800
not a scholarship unless you pay for it.

116
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:25,510
- I agree with Daniel because like, well
yeah, I agree with Arkie because the

117
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,670
grandfather actually had to tell the
principal that they shouldn't have to pay

118
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,440
for it instead of Martha going to speak to
the principal in person.

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,300
- I disagree with that.
- I disagree with that.

120
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,030
- I disagree.

121
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:46,430
- I disagree with Daniel and Javier
because even though her grandpa told her

122
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,030
what to say, her grandpa didn't go up to
the principal and actually tell it was actually Martha

123
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,770
who went up to the principal and got ideas
of what to say.

124
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,920
- I agree with Myra because it's true. I
mean he didn't go, Martha actually had the

125
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,360
guts to say what her grandfather had said.
So that's why I say that Martha had most

126
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,560
of the guts to do that instead of the
grandfather. The grandfather might've said

127
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,850
that, but she was the one that stood there
and said it. That took a lot of courage to

128
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,160
me.

129
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,990
- [Teacher] Okay. So you know that was a great
leader should be courageous enough. So I

130
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,200
like what Arkie said, Arkie said, you
know, I disagree that Martha was a leader

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:40,970
and Arkie open up that. Thank you very
much, Archimedes. Thank you all of you for

132
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,580
sharing that. Any other person?

133
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,050
- To me Martha represents a hard worker
because since first grade she worked hard

134
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,570
to get her good grades and not get in
trouble.

135
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:01,030
- [Teacher] Okay. She worked really hard.
Thank you.

136
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,430
Any other person that wanted to add
something?

137
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,940
- It seems to me that Martha is a
[inaudible] that proves that it

138
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:14,539
doesn't matter her race or color, she
could do anything the same as anybody else

139
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:15,947
can do.
- [Teacher] Wow.

140
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:22,450
- I agree with Ashley because a lot of
people discriminate, like Mexican people

141
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,300
or like Mexican Americans, just because
their family or their ancestors came from

142
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,020
somewhere else and they're not from the
United States.

143
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:37,649
- [Teacher] So you know what has Martha
done to straighten that or to disprove

144
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:39,313
that?

145
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:45,489
- She showed that who cares where you're
from or who you are, you can always do

146
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:46,641
your best.

147
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:51,601
- [Teacher] Okay. So you know there was,
Martha is representing to us that we can

148
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:58,225
do whatever we put our mind in doing. If
we really work hard we know that it will

149
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,273
work. Is that what I'm hearing from all of
you?

150
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,297
- [together] Yes.

151
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:05,201
- [Teacher] That it doesn't matter what
race, you know, if you work really hard

152
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:09,169
you know that you can achieve. Thank you
very much for sharing that.

153
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:20,145
- I really admire her because I know some
people who have been made fun of just

154
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:26,481
because of their race and it's somewhat
sad because some people aren't allowed to

155
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:31,057
do things just because of their skin color
or where they're from. What I think is

156
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:40,657
that it doesn't matter what you are. No
one is bad except for the person who's

157
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:45,297
making fun of your race. You are not the
bad one, it's the person who's making fun

158
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,545
of you.

159
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:51,990
- [Teacher] Thank you very much. Any other
person that wants to add something to

160
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,210
this?

161
00:11:52,210 --> 00:12:01,090
- I agree 
- [Inaudible]
- because in a poem it says you
can't persuade anyone unless you have the

162
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,150
courage to make them, like, persuade them.

163
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:12,570
- [Teacher] Thank you very much. Now let's
go on to the last question. Thank you very

164
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,410
much for sharing. I could hear from all of
you. The last question is what other

165
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:25,120
stories have you read that share a similar
theme with Scholarship Jacket. Think of

166
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:34,470
other characters that have faced difficult
choices or situations. Okay? So think of

167
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:42,170
that. What other stories have you read,
okay? Anyone can start.

168
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,360
- I think Crossing the Wire is somewhat
similar because Pablo was Mexican, too,

169
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,720
and they mistreated him and denied him a
job. However, he worked as hard as Martha.

170
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,830
- [Teacher] Thank you for sharing that.
You call that Crossing what?

171
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,880
- Crossing the Wire.

172
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,110
- [Teacher] Crossing the Wire. Thank you.

173
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,811
- I think the story of Martin Luther King
is pretty similar to The Scholarship

174
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:13,958
Jacket because they discriminated a lot
against African-Americans because of their

175
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:20,394
color, but Martin Luther King stood up for
his race and said that we should not

176
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:24,618
discriminate others because we're
different. We're all the same just because

177
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:26,060
of color doesn't separate us.

178
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,740
- [Teacher] Thank you very much for
sharing that.

179
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,450
- I agree with Jennifer, Martin Luther
King said that it doesn't matter where

180
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,679
you're from or who you are, everybody
inside is the same and all of us are

181
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,479
brothers.

182
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,090
- [Teacher] Thank you very much for
sharing that.

183
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:50,010
- I have seem the movie The Blind Side
which is pretty similar to the story.

184
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,500
Michael shows great leadership because he
is an African-American and he is poor and

185
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,480
he tries to pull himself up to be able to
play at a Catholic school to play

186
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,240
football.
- [Teacher] Thank you.

187
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,365
- I agree with Carlos. I've also seen that
movie and the movie has a lot of great

188
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,349
leaders definitely Michael.

189
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:17,340
- I agree with Carlos because in that
movie, Michael, from the beginning he

190
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,790
didn't want to go to school, he actually
had really low grades and the family he

191
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:28,910
had, they're from another race, and even
though he had really low scores, they got

192
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,787
him a tutor and they helped him, like,
reach his goals so he could play football

193
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:33,630
for the school he wanted to play.

194
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,460
- [Teacher] Wow. Thanks again.

195
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:42,720
- I have read The Outsiders, which is a
story about two classes of people, the

196
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,510
Greasers and the Soches. The greasers get
treated real dirty because of their lower

197
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,270
class.

198
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:56,130
- [Teacher] Okay. At the end what
happened? Did they succeed like Martha?

199
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,010
Did they achieve?

200
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,560
- Some of them died.

201
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,000
- [Teacher] Some of them died, okay.
