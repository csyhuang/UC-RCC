1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,259
- In the Lion King,

2
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,605
like I was thinking about it,

3
00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:06,274
there's no democracy in any of the movie.

4
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:07,412
- [Teacher] No, there isn't.

5
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:09,083
- Yeah, and how the Lion King's,

6
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,986
like everything seems really British,

7
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:17,558
you know, like very England,
monarchy-type stuff.

8
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,927
But in the Lion King, what bothered me

9
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:21,181
is when it said like,

10
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,225
the two hyenas,

11
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:24,129
like Cheech from Cheech
and Chong was one of them,

12
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:25,546
and then Whoopi Goldberg
was the other one.

13
00:00:25,546 --> 00:00:27,914
I was just like, how could they do that,

14
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:31,002
and like not realize that they were

15
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,953
feeding into this racial
stereotype by being

16
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:34,648
the voices of the hyenas?

17
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:35,994
Like don't they think about that stuff?

18
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,666
- [Girl] Yeah, I was
thinking the same thing.

19
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:39,408
- [Teacher] Did you think about it before,

20
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,195
when you first read Cinderella?

21
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:44,423
- I think when I watched the Lion King,

22
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:47,464
like I thought about it.

23
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,718
I mean, even when I was little,

24
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:49,995
I think it registered in my mind,

25
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:51,714
like, "That's a black woman's voice.

26
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:55,382
"Why would her voice be in this animal,

27
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:57,518
"and not any of the other voices?"
- [Teacher] Right.

28
00:00:57,518 --> 00:01:00,769
I don't know Disney
intentionally did this.

29
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,159
They were building up into
an already existing culture

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,249
of racial stereotypes,

31
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:08,942
so I think the mentality of that

32
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:12,402
was why fix what's not been broken,

33
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:15,327
and when they should have fixed it.

34
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:16,697
- [Girl in striped sweater]
But at the same time,

35
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:19,692
Mufasa was that really, what's his name?

36
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,341
James Earl Jones, who's
like Morgan Freeman.

37
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:22,990
- [Teacher] Right, Mufasa was an evil--

38
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,151
- Like if I had to pick a God, it would be

39
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,544
James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman.

40
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:29,003
- [Teacher] Mufasa was the
good, Simba's father, right?

41
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:29,978
- [Girl in striped sweater] Yeah.

42
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:33,197
With like the really deep voice.

43
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:35,670
- [Teacher] You made a good point, though,

44
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,523
about no democracy in Disney movies.

45
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:43,796
There isn't, because there's
no democracy in marketing.

46
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:46,165
There's no democracy in the media.

47
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:51,761
What are the six big media conglomerates?

48
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:53,500
Disney.

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,754
- [Boy] Disney, GE ...

50
00:01:54,754 --> 00:01:55,799
- What else?

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,029
- [Boy] GE.

52
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,190
- GE.

53
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,072
- [Girl] Newscorp.

54
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:00,582
- Yeah, Newscorp.

55
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,719
- [Girl] Then Viacom.

56
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,393
- Viacom.

57
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:03,298
- [Boy] Time Warner.

58
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:04,157
- And Time Warner.

59
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,597
- [Girl in striped sweater]
But why can't Cinderella

60
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,688
be a first lady?

61
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:08,755
Why does she have to be a queen?

62
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,937
Like why can't she have
some other magical power?

63
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:14,722
- Why can't we instill some like, actual

64
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:16,142
life in there?

65
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:17,484
- But that's still not, this
is still not the classic,

66
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,108
but then I wouldn't be surprised if Disney

67
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:23,544
will come up with another story.

68
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:24,684
- [Girl] I hope they do.

69
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:27,586
- Well, they came up with Tiana, right?

70
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:30,233
Which added the gender stereo- the roles,

71
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,043
the racial roles, or
the racial stereotypes.

72
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:35,736
Tiana is absolutely beautiful.

73
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,036
The image.

74
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:39,730
However, there are, again,

75
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,866
the pre-existing culture and norms

76
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:45,140
that Disney is too
scared to move away from,

77
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,508
because that has provided
them or given them

78
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,691
this 80 billion dollar industry.

79
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:53,592
I did promise you a reading on,

80
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:54,358
we do have time,

81
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:57,283
I promised you a reading on China,

82
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:58,677
as to what happens in China.

83
00:02:58,677 --> 00:02:59,512
Before I do that,

84
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,788
I just want your input on

85
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:04,063
the Disneyfication of children's culture,

86
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,155
with the article that you read.

87
00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:07,151
I know you wanted to talk about it,

88
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,053
you were really excited.

89
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,675
If you have your article in front of you,

90
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,514
you can use that.

91
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:15,685
You can look at it.

92
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,890
I also jotted down plenty of notes,

93
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:24,460
but when you reflect on what we did today,

94
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,524
I want you to think, these books,

95
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:30,936
these books are

96
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:36,518
books are media, music is
media, videos are media, okay?

97
00:03:36,518 --> 00:03:40,275
Food for thought for next time
when we have our discussion:

98
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:49,662
Does media construct
an image or a message?

99
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:53,230
There's no right or wrong
answer, but think about it.

100
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,868
Does the media construct an image

101
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:03,330
or a message?

102
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,790
Okay? As you read your read articles.

103
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,297
So, Hannah, to you, go ahead.

104
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:11,596
- [Hannah] The whole like Aladdin where,

105
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,475
how they changed the verse, the lyrics,

106
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,565
that was like awful.
- [Girl] That was crazy!

107
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:22,764
- Like, I think I have a
different opinion from everybody,

108
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,806
like, truth hurts, to me.

109
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:31,820
I think it's just like, I
don't care that it says that.

110
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,491
Like, I didn't notice that,

111
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:36,974
no one notices that while they're singing.

112
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:39,157
Like, while they're singing that,

113
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,438
no one like realizes,

114
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,251
oh, "Cut off your ear."

115
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,921
- [Girl] Kids don't. Like
if your (inaudible) was in--

116
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,105
- And that actually happened back then,

117
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,638
that actually happened.

118
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:48,799
- [Girl in maroon] The ear
one didn't bother me as much,

119
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,797
because that's kind of true.

120
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:52,188
But the whole, it's
barbaric, the (inaudible)

121
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:53,303
like that was awful. It shouldn't be--

122
00:04:53,303 --> 00:04:54,534
- [Girl with blue scarf]
Because if you think about

123
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:57,645
where it is, if you look into the history,

124
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:00,663
it is barbaric, and they used to do it.

125
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:03,055
And in some places, they still do it.

126
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,657
It's the whole Hammurabi,
"An eye for an eye."

127
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:06,538
You know, it's that culture.

128
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,767
- [Hannah] Yeah, it's true,
it's true, so why not teach

129
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,578
what actually happened?

130
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,225
- But I don't really have a
problem with it, I mean like--

131
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:14,874
- But if that's the only
way that you're looking

132
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,476
at the Middle East, then that's wrong.

133
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,705
Because they have a
history with beautiful art,

134
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:21,003
they invented math, and like they gave us

135
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,209
all this wonderful stuff,

136
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,347
that you can't just look at the problems

137
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:25,136
that they have now,

138
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:26,785
or the violence that was in their culture,

139
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,361
because there's violence everywhere.

140
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,893
- I mean, that's just stereotyping.

141
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:30,984
- They cut people's ears off

142
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:33,562
in the Middle Ages in England

143
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:35,837
just as much as they did,
or at least as the same.

144
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,486
- They did worse things,
probably, in the Middle Ages,

145
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,736
than they did in cutting
off people's ears.

146
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:43,081
- It's just unfair that they
portayed the Middle East

147
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,937
like strictly as a barbaric, violent place

148
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,981
in that song.

149
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,281
It just makes it wrong.

150
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:50,860
- [Girl in blue and white] I
think it was like in general,

151
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,042
and it was because Arabia was so bad

152
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,692
in an oasis like that.

153
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,061
- [Girl in striped sweater]
Yeah, they weren't specific,

154
00:05:56,061 --> 00:06:00,264
it was just "Arabia," but like it took,

155
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:04,884
there was like Indian things about Aladdin

156
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:06,672
that it wasn't supposed to be India,

157
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:10,786
it was supposed to be like
Israel, or totally different--

158
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:13,893
- There were a lot of like
Middle Eastern elements

159
00:06:13,893 --> 00:06:15,704
rolled into one,

160
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:16,726
so it would make one thing,

161
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,117
like if you went to the Middle East,

162
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:21,068
if you went to like Pakistan,

163
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:23,343
it wouldn't be what they say it is,

164
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:25,386
or if you went to India
or you went to Israel,

165
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,896
like they just took bits and pieces

166
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:28,684
and combined it into one.

167
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:29,845
Which looks like a different--

168
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,377
- [Teacher] Why did they do that?

169
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:32,352
What would you think--

170
00:06:32,352 --> 00:06:34,001
- They didn't look into it,

171
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,580
they didn't bother to do the research.

172
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,439
- [Girl with blue scarf]
Yeah, they probably didn't--

173
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,553
- [Girl in striped sweater]
Because their culture

174
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:38,598
is so different than American culture,

175
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,759
that they just thought that they could

176
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,199
just skip over it.

177
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,126
Like I thought it was gross that

178
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,844
they didn't even bother to translate

179
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,246
what they wanted to say on a manuscript.

180
00:06:47,246 --> 00:06:48,911
Like if it was in English,

181
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:51,512
they would have had the actual letters

182
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,835
on the piece of paper,

183
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,484
but they just, you think that

184
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,550
you can just go like this on the board,

185
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,338
and that looks like Arabic writing?

186
00:06:58,338 --> 00:06:59,104
That's not--

187
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,055
- Arabic writing is really complicated.

188
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,750
- And the whole thing
with all the accents,

189
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,375
how all the bad guys had accents,

190
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,768
and the good guys didn't.
The bad guys had like--

191
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:06,952
- Oh, the beards and noses?

192
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,680
- Bigger beards, and then the good guys,

193
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,029
they looked American.

194
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,438
- [Girl in grey jacket] I
think it made you assume

195
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:13,297
the worst,

196
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:14,574
like reading that just made me like,

197
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:16,640
"Wow," like, "Oh my gosh,"

198
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,474
it's not really giving
you the information--

199
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:19,519
- [Girl in striped sweater]
But yet, you didn't

200
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,680
notice it when you
watched it though, right?

201
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,702
- [Girl in grey jacket] Yeah,
I mean, you didn't at all.

202
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:22,747
- [Girl with blue scarf] I did, though.

203
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:24,001
- But then when we're older,
we go back in history--

204
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:24,767
- Maybe that's because I have that class

205
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,135
and we realized that it's
all war with religion,

206
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,255
and like I know those times.

207
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:32,101
- [Teacher] Go ahead.
Religion, what about it?

208
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:33,448
- She noticed that--

209
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:34,377
- I did notice those things,

210
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,188
like you can kind of tell like different

211
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:38,858
culturally-wise, like the different

212
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,831
Indian elements in Israel,

213
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,780
or the different like
Pakistani influences, but,

214
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,729
and they had like Hindu going on.

215
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,192
It's just really, really weird.

216
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,283
But I did notice that,

217
00:07:49,283 --> 00:07:51,419
but like, I don't know,
maybe like Hannah said,

218
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,162
she didn't notice that,

219
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:55,320
but because she didn't grow up like

220
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,038
learning to write Arabic,
- [Hannah] No.

221
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:59,592
- And like reading about all that stuff.

222
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:02,959
I guess it's also like, how you grew up.

223
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,283
- Right.

224
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,862
- Someone who showed America,

225
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:09,286
like (inaudible) without photos.

226
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:10,953
- I have a question.

227
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:11,742
When you think about it,

228
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,484
when we talk about American culture,

229
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:16,456
we view it as pretty homogeneous,

230
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:17,756
of the American values.

231
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:19,429
Okay, there are these values,

232
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:20,287
and that's all there is.

233
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:23,514
But we know that that's not true.

234
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:25,767
Do you find that to be,

235
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:29,017
with these movies, by
blending all of those

236
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,734
different spaces, and all
those different cultures,

237
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:34,683
do you find that to be the
message is not carried out

238
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:36,773
the right way to children,

239
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:41,416
that the Middle East is
highly diverse, okay?

240
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,901
And not everybody looks the same,

241
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:48,034
or writes the same, or behaves the same,

242
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:49,752
but Disney has done something

243
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:53,467
that the media does. What
does the media assume?

244
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:55,626
That everybody who watches a movie--

245
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,995
- [Girl] Is going to react the same way.

246
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,363
- [Teacher] It's going to
react the same way, right?

247
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:05,866
So the media assumes that
homogeneity attitude. Yes?

248
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:07,723
- The problems in the past 20 years

249
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:09,140
in the Middle East,

250
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,112
like when little kids
grow up, and it's like,

251
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:15,177
if I look at a picture of Osama bin Laden,

252
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:17,197
I think, "Jafar," because he has a beard

253
00:09:17,197 --> 00:09:19,450
and he looks like that.

254
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,958
Like we're taught that that is evil.

255
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,003
- [Girl with blue scarf]
Do you really? I don't.

256
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,814
- That the person with the
turban and beard is evil,

257
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:27,878
because the terrorists that
are doing these awful things

258
00:09:27,878 --> 00:09:29,294
to people all over the world,

259
00:09:29,294 --> 00:09:31,059
just happen to be Muslim,

260
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,963
totally extremist Muslims that

261
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,981
most of the people that
carry out their religion

262
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,722
don't practice.

263
00:09:37,722 --> 00:09:39,951
Kind of like most Christians
during the Middle Ages

264
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:41,577
didn't go out and chop people's heads off

265
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:43,481
in the name of Jesus. It's the same thing.

266
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,046
- [Teacher] Right.

267
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:44,777
- You know?

268
00:09:44,777 --> 00:09:48,846
But we look at those pictures
of those Middle Eastern men

269
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,262
and we think bad because of it,

270
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:52,746
which is like Jafar and Aladdin.

271
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:55,638
- [Hannah] That's when
acceptance comes in, like--

272
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,656
- [Girl in grey jacket] You
have to accept what's true

273
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:57,538
and what's not.

274
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:57,933
- Exactly.

275
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,001
- Talk about ignorance,

276
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:02,368
I mean, why do we have to accept that?

277
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,993
- [Hannah] Because it's not true.

278
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:06,269
- Because it's not true, there
are thousand and thousands

279
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:07,917
- You don't see me going
like, "Oh, I'm making bombs."

280
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:09,984
- I'm not like saying
acceptance like it's not true,

281
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:14,952
I'm not like saying acceptance
like, Osama bin Laden,

282
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:19,271
like accepting that's what
he looks like to like Jafar.

283
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:23,567
Like, that's who he was, so
that's what he looks like.

284
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,612
You know what I'm saying?

285
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,912
- Yeah, but I don't see that.

286
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:26,585
If I see,

287
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,745
if I look at Osama bin
Laden, I don't see Jafar.

288
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:29,534
- No I don't either.

289
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,393
- I don't identify it at all.

290
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:32,970
- I don't either, but
you know what I'm saying?

291
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,503
- Yeah, like little kids
like 10 years from now,

292
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,291
if they watch Aladdin and
they're going to grow up,

293
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,079
and what's going to be in
the news is September 11th

294
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,750
and Osama bin Laden.

295
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,444
- But what the point
is is that evil people

296
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:45,253
look like everybody else.

297
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,343
Like, Ursula could have just been a

298
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,899
really pretty mermaid,

299
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,199
and still done all the horrible things

300
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:51,782
that she did to Ariel.
- [Teacher] Right.

301
00:10:51,782 --> 00:10:53,082
- Like it doesn't matter
what you look like,

302
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,474
they create these evil images of people,

303
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:58,427
like all old ladies
are either really smart

304
00:10:58,427 --> 00:10:59,443
or they're evil.

305
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:03,019
They either have wisdom
or they're out to get you.

306
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,946
There's no in-between.

307
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:06,803
- [Teacher] Or the
zoo-keeper in (inaudible),

308
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,754
he had a German accent, he was evil,

309
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:13,699
and that was during a war, the movie.

310
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,534
- Or like the three crows, right?

311
00:11:15,534 --> 00:11:17,693
That were talking in like the very like,

312
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:24,287
I don't know, African-American,
inner-city slang,

313
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,560
and they were, just all that
stuff that was just really--

314
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,674
- [Girl in grey jacket]
It kinds of makes it,

315
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:30,696
like just like the story was describing

316
00:11:30,696 --> 00:11:32,577
what a bad person must look like,

317
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:34,364
we have that image like up here,

318
00:11:34,364 --> 00:11:35,456
like tell them it looks like this,

319
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:37,476
so when we see them, we
automatically assume like,

320
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:38,892
"Oh man, it could be a terrorist,"

321
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:39,937
just like when we watch a movie,

322
00:11:39,937 --> 00:11:41,864
like, "Oh, that's the bad guy."

323
00:11:41,864 --> 00:11:44,140
So like it's the same as
if they're doing a cartoon,

324
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,742
and if we're in real life.

325
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:49,062
- Right, so that leads
to problems that we have

326
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,803
with profiling, for example.

327
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:53,845
Putting people on one side, or, yes?

328
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,771
- [Blonde girl] It doesn't
really relate to the article,

329
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,232
but I was watching a movie with my mom,

330
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,788
and I don't know what it was called,

331
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:04,688
but there's this like,
I guess class project,

332
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:07,568
or oral presentation
that someone had to do,

333
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:10,818
and this girl chose to
write about her religion,

334
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:11,863
which she was Muslim,

335
00:12:11,863 --> 00:12:15,207
and she wrote about like 9/11

336
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:18,782
and she was like, "Just
because they did that

337
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:20,408
"doesn't mean we're all evil."

338
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,521
And like I don't know,
she had all this stuff,

339
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:27,048
and then the principal like
told the FBI or something,

340
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:30,299
and they came to her house
and deported her family

341
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:31,599
back to where she came from.

342
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:36,104
Just because of that. That's it.

343
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:37,474
- [Hannah] That's when like a school needs

344
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,192
to teach acceptance.

345
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,651
That's not the end. Or like
families and the school

346
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:43,441
needs to teach acceptance.

347
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,413
Everyone was calling her
like a suicide bomber,

348
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,736
and like, "Go kill yourself,"

349
00:12:48,736 --> 00:12:50,592
or, "Are you gonna bomb all of us?"

350
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:52,078
- [Girl in striped sweater]
And we call ourselves a country

351
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:53,007
of freedom of religion.

352
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:56,699
- [Girl in black] I remember
when I was in sixth grade,

353
00:12:56,699 --> 00:12:59,230
there was a girl, she was Muslim,

354
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,063
and people used to throw
markers at her and stuff,

355
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:03,038
and call her a terrorist.

356
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:05,401
It was around 9/11 and stuff like that,

357
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:06,590
and it used to like upset me

358
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,798
because I used to feel really bad.

359
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:09,400
Because she like didn't do anything,

360
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,979
she barely even knew how to talk.

361
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,488
They'd like throw
markers at her and stuff,

362
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:15,019
just because she was Muslim.

363
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:15,933
- Like, because like
no one has acceptance,

364
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,048
like no one learns that,

365
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:19,300
it's just like people make inferences,

366
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,459
like, "Oh, man, it's a bad person,

367
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,456
"so let's stay away, let's shy away,

368
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:24,547
"let's make fun of them,"

369
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,730
instead of like, when you're
going down the street,

370
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,657
and just like we were
talking about earlier,

371
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,329
how there's like, if
you see a big black man,

372
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:31,304
you're gonna put your phone away,

373
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:32,163
you're going to take your phone out

374
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,624
and try to call your mom,
put her on speed dial.

375
00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:36,900
You don't have acceptance, either.

376
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,456
Like you may say we should get it,

377
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:39,895
but you don't have it.

378
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:42,499
It's just the way we grow up.

379
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,388
- [Blonde girl] We don't suspend judgment.

380
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:45,317
- [Teacher] You don't suspend judgment.

381
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,385
It's difficult to do so.

382
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,451
There is this conflict between acceptance

383
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:53,165
and our values. Because
the values that we have,

384
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,762
that think by this individualistic
view of what it is,

385
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:02,034
and in doing so, you
divide people into groups,

386
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,612
and construct images about those people,

387
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:07,769
and it's as simple as reading
a children's story, okay,

388
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:11,183
or as watching or turning
the TV on in the morning

389
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,435
and just watching the Disney Channel,

390
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,989
or Noggin, or Nick, Jr., or whatever.

391
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,218
There's messages that we
impart on our children,

392
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,866
there's messages that
we impart on ourselves.

393
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:22,978
Or picking up the newspaper.

394
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,955
I don't know if you guys have
noticed in the newspaper,

395
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:28,020
but there is a big, there's a dichotomy

396
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,108
between how different areas are described.

397
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:37,485
Immediate areas, our city
compared to our surrounding areas.

398
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:38,642
- (inaudible)

399
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,678
- Right, so media is biased.

400
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:43,627
They're systemically biased, okay?

401
00:14:43,627 --> 00:14:45,786
There is no democracy, but here is

402
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,665
the fundamental thing as an American,

403
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:50,755
we pride ourselves in democracy,

404
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:53,286
we pride ourselves in leadership,

405
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:54,493
so what do you do?

406
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:59,889
What path do you follow?

407
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,040
How do you--
