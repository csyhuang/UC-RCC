1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
- Today I'm going to introduce to you our
new project, and it's based on the concept

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,950
of surrealism. When you look at this word,
you should recognize a smaller word within

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,320
it. Does anyone recognize the smaller
word?

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,950
- Real.

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,490
- Real, that's right. The word "real."
And we know real is the way things really

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,340
look when we see them, or the way they
appear. But the word "sur" transforms that

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,140
word. And because this is a French word,
"sur" means "beyond." So now what the

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,930
word "surrealism" implies is beyond
reality, or the way things really appear.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,680
So what does that look like? It looks very
dreamlike. It doesn't necessarily make

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,710
sense. A lot of different things go on in
surrealism, and I'm going to show you a

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,730
few examples right now. These are the
three characteristics that we're going to

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,410
focus on. The first characteristic is out
of place objects. If you look at this

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,920
example up here, what's out of place in
this picture? Can anyone tell me? Trevor?

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,040
- The guy's face.

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,630
- What's over his face, just floating
there? Can anyone tell? You're up close,

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,862
Matthew. You see what that is?
- An apple.

17
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:07,000
- It's a green apple, okay? And that is an
out of place object. Definitely surreal.

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,900
These are examples of surrealism. This
example right here. What's in here,

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,331
Jordan?
- Train.

20
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,080
- There's a train coming out of a
fireplace. Okay, again, an out of place

21
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,960
object. These are two examples of one of
those characteristics of out of place

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,000
objects. Another characteristic that you
see are unreal scenes. Scenes that do not

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:30,340
make sense. They're beyond real. What's
going on in this scene? Kurt?

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,510
- There's, like, giant butterflies.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,560
- Yeah. The butterflies grew. They're
huge. Now they're like the props on the

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,130
windmills. What's going on in this? Can
anyone tell? What makes that surreal?

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,900
John?
- Like, huge makeup.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,500
- Yeah, the si-, again, the size of such
little things grew tremendously, and

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,100
they're filling up the room. Also, the
interior of the room is now looking like

30
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,420
the sky. So what made these unreal is the
artist changed something that was small

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,510
and made it really, really big.
The last characteristic that we see in

32
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:12,910
surrealism is... there it is. Normal
objects acting abnormally. So in these

33
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,230
examples I'll go through real quickly. Do
you see these clocks? They're not acting

34
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,360
normally. These clocks are melting,
they're dripping, they're stretching,

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,660
they're falling down. You can see that. In
this one, the artist drew a person looking

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,200
into the mirror, but does he see his
reflection?

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,970
- No.

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,910
- No. The mirror's not operating normally.
It's surreal. It's beyond real. What it's

39
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,660
doing is it's showing the back of his
head. And again, in this one, it's kind of

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,260
hard to tell, but there are three swans,
and the reflection is of three elephants.

41
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,160
So the reflection in the water is not
acting normally. These are three

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:55,030
characteristics of surrealism, all right?
So why surrealism? Why this style of art?

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,750
Does anyone have any guesses of why
anyone, or why these artists created

44
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,910
something like this? Yeah?

45
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,832
- Because it's like a modern form of art.

46
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:06,260
- Okay, yeah. That's actually a very good
definition. Cara?

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,590
- Maybe to make it look interesting.

48
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,540
- Okay, good.
- To make it look funny.

49
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,840
- Okay, good. Guys, those are all
excellent, excellent answers. Here is

50
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,070
another thing that went into surrealism.
Like lots of art, it's influenced by

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,760
what's going on around it or what happened
before it. So these three boxes represent

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,300
three other styles of art that influenced
the ideas of surrealism. And the first

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,690
style of art is known as Dada art. This
type of art is where the artist took

54
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,810
things, and they tried to make something
that wasn't considered art. They took

55
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,050
random objects, like a bicycle wheel and
the stool, and put it together and said,

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,050
"Okay, this is not art." And that was an
example of the style. They also took a

57
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,450
famous painting like the Mona Lisa,
scribbled mustache and a beard. There it

58
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,330
is. That's not art. And that was really
the whole idea of Dada. It was like

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,760
anti-art. Another thing that influenced
surrealism was symbolism. Symbolism was a

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,190
style of art in which the artist tried to
depict an idea of something.

61
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,510
And in this example, it's the idea of
death. There's this dark angel depicted

62
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,460
over this man, who's already halfway down
in the ground. All this white snow that

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,730
symbolizes life around him. And it was
just the idea of what that might look like

64
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,110
using symbols. And that's what that one
depicts. The other example, or another

65
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:29,640
influence of surrealism, is metaphysical
painting. This one's very, very hard to

66
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,190
understand, and that's what the idea was
with the style. It was to kind of paint an

67
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,070
unreal or illogical situation. Basically
one in which you do not know what you're

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,910
looking at. You don't know what the
objects are. You might know something, but

69
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,500
you don't know why it's there or what part
of it it is. And it's very, very illogical

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,670
and doesn't make sense. These three styles
of art in the boxes influenced surrealism.

71
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,520
So when you look at these three styles of
art, you can kind of see what they led to.

72
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:08,180
They led to this style of art, which is
known as surrealism. So now... where to

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,600
start. Here's what's going on today.
Today, you are going to start with...

74
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,050
and you can open your folders up, and
you'll see this slide. What we're going to

75
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,100
do is we're going to start drawing today.
We are going to start by making a

76
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,160
connection, all right? And if you look at
this example up here on the board, or, and

77
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,480
you can look at your slides, too. What
we're going to do... you can just take

78
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,560
your stuff off, Leann, leave it back
there, and then join your table, okay?

79
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,450
What we're going to do is I want you to
come up with something that means

80
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,200
something to you, and that's like your
theme to start with. Maybe it's a hobby,

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,060
an activity, a memory, anything that's
meaningful to you, that's your starting

82
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,410
point. Then what we have to do is we have
to give it an element of surprise. So

83
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,770
these are our options that I just
discussed. Those are the characteristics.

84
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,870
Do you want to move it around, change the
location of it? Do you want to make the

85
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,910
sizes different and create an unreal
scene?

86
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,170
Or do you want to make objects in it doing
something that they shouldn't be doing?

87
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,880
Let me give you an example. Lily, what's
your favorite food?

88
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,017
- Strawberries.

89
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:11,500
- Strawberries. What's your favorite
holiday, Joe?

90
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,710
- Christmas.

91
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,961
- Jacob, what's your favorite animal?
- A dog.

92
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:20,130
- Okay. So this is my surrealist example
to you. You have a Christmas tree, but

93
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,830
instead of a Christmas tree, you have a
big strawberry standing up with

94
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,080
decorations on it, and then you have dogs
putting those decorations on it. So that's

95
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,400
kind of an example of taking things that
are meaningful to you and putting them

96
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,460
into a surrealist example. These are some
examples that I have that I did. These are

97
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,430
some of my drawings. This first one, and
sometimes you don't even know where these

98
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,000
drawings are coming from. I wanted to take
an object and stretch it. I wanted to make

99
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,520
it act abnormally. So I chose a spoon. And
what I did was I thought, well, a spoon

100
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,170
needs to catch something. So this spoon is
stretching out trying to catch the

101
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,637
raindrops. Why? Because it's really dry
wherever it is. You can see all the

102
00:06:56,637 --> 00:07:00,410
cracks. So that was kind of like my first
idea. The second sketch that I did was I

103
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,880
wanted to do something with a tropical
type of a setting. An unreal scene in an

104
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:10,540
unreal place. So what I thought was, well,
pineapples are tropical. Why not cut open

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,170
a pineapple, and there is my tropical
beach with all the little palm trees,

106
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,910
okay? You're probably wondering what we're
going to do with these. Today is

107
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,610
sketching, but what's going to happen is
this is going to turn into a watercolor

108
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,730
painting. This is an example of what the
painting might look like when it's all

109
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,450
done. I chose the pineapple one, all
right? So we are going to be doing a

110
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,050
watercolor painting, but today we need to
kind of come up with ideas of what that

111
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,160
painting's going to look like. Up here on
the board, I think this is going to help

112
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,250
you a lot. This is a bunch of different
examples of surrealist paintings, and

113
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,930
there's a variety of different things that
the artist has done. They might be food,

114
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,660
they might be animals, they might be
instruments, they might be people, they

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,580
might be landscapes. There's lots of
things to look at. I want you to use this

116
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,410
as your primary resource to help you and
guide you through your drawings. I'm going

117
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,640
to give you paper right now. Use this
sheet. Start with making a connection, all

118
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,390
right?
Start with making a connection, and then

119
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,060
look at the different options and ways
that you can make it surreal, all right?

120
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,760
- How do you draw hands?

121
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,380
- Hands? That's... okay, hands. You know
what? This is just a sketch. So this is a

122
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,120
detail that doesn't... or this is a part
that you don't really need to worry about.

123
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,870
So tell me what's going on. What makes
this surreal?

124
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,440
- Um...
- That's what I want to know.

125
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,370
- Because it's the birthday party in the
present.

126
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:36,780
- Okay. So which of these options do you
think you're focusing the most on?

127
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,960
- This one.
- Okay, and why?

128
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,890
- Because a present usually doesn't open.

129
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,190
- Okay, so the present, so the party is
within the present. So the present gets

130
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,840
opened up, and then there's a party. Okay.
What else can we do to make it, like,

131
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,070
maybe a little bit more, like, bam,
something going on? That's the only thing

132
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,320
I was thinking about, you know? Like,
maybe...

133
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,030
- Like balloons and...

134
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,300
- Yeah, balloons. Like, they're com-,
they're flowing out. That'd be really

135
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,950
cool. All right, that's good.

136
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,520
- What should I, like, do for, like, for,
like, the face?

137
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,630
The face on a...?
- Baseball.

138
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,240
- Baseball. And what are we using for the
parts of the face?

139
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,230
- So this is a baseball bat.

140
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,340
- Okay.
- And I...

141
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,208
- Okay.
- These are the baseball bases.

142
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,206
- Oh, the bases, okay.

143
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:29,739
- Yeah. And this is
[inaudible],

144
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:31,039
and this is...

145
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,970
- Okay. So you're combining, you're
combining...

146
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,550
- A lot.

147
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,350
- ...a lot of different things. So why
freckles?

148
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:42,290
- Because, like, I thought putting more
into it would make it more interesting.

149
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,070
- Okay. You know what I think would make
this really more interesting is the

150
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,530
background. What's going on around the
face?

151
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,540
- Um...

152
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,310
- Think about it. Think about it. What
could we do? Where could this be?

153
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,801
- In the sky?

154
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:57,070
- I don't know. So what would represent
the sky? What could you draw to represent

155
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,910
the sky?
- Clouds?

156
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,370
- Try that. Maybe draw some clouds. I
think, I think that's going to make your

157
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,785
picture more interesting. Something like
that.

158
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:05,923
- Because, like, someone hit a home run.

159
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:08,530
- Yeah, okay. And maybe some action lines
around the ball. You know, like a little--

160
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,847
- Yeah.

161
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:13,580
- That looks really good. I like that. I
like that one a lot.

162
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,360
- A dog eating pizza.

163
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,740
- Okay, Brittney. Yeah.

164
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
- I don't know how to draw horses.

165
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,040
- A horse?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,300
- Why do you need a horse?

167
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,908
- Because I want to draw, like, a horse
[inaudible].

168
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,840
- What were you going to do?

169
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,995
- Like...
- A horse...

170
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:33,100
- A horse with a farm inside of it.

171
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,636
- Inside of it. So what do you mean inside
of it, though?

172
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,550
- Like, in here, do, like, a farm, and
cows, and...

173
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,320
- Well, here's a suggestion, because I
like your idea a lot. Why don't we... we

174
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,100
can use this as a resource. Why don't we
draw, I'll help you with this, just the

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,520
back of the horse, okay? So we'll just
work, we'll focus on, like, the neck and

176
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,170
the back, and then the tail kind of coming
down like this, okay? So you see where I'm

177
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,260
going with this? Now what I'm thinking is
why don't you draw your farm scene on the

178
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,820
back? Like, almost that it's, like, kind
of been placed on there, like a little

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,420
miniature scene. Like, so maybe on here,
you could draw the silo, the barn, and

180
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,313
everything on there. Good? Eyes on me.

181
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:17,530
- One, two, three.

182
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,290
- Okay, guys, you're doing a really,
really good job with your sketching and

183
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,290
everything, and I don't, I want you to
keep going. But we do need to stop for a

184
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,920
minute. And based on the drawings that I'm
seeing, I see some really good examples of

185
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,740
surrealism, and you're showing me that you
understand it. I bet you that if you saw

186
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,550
an example of surrealism with some other
styles of art, you could pick out the one

187
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,810
that represents surrealism. Take a look up
here on the board. I have three Tabasco

188
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,120
sauce posters, okay? One, two, three, and
four. Show me with your fingers, holding

189
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,230
them up in the air, which one of these is
an example of surrealism. Think about it

190
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,634
for a minute. While you think about it,
I'm going to wiggle my mouse so I can...

191
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,840
okay.
What's an example of, which one is a...

192
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,730
Jess. Okay, everyone had four. That's
good. Why? Why that one? Why'd you pick

193
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,700
that one?
- Because, like...

194
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,560
- Nope, hold on. I was going to let Jessie
answer first. What makes that one surreal?

195
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:22,690
Think about it. Michael, go ahead.

196
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,230
- The sides are, like, coming off the
bottle.

197
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,700
- Okay.

198
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,330
- And the pepper's, like, putting out the
sauce.

199
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,270
- Okay, good. Anything else? Erin?

200
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,350
- It's, like, out on this, like, island.

201
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,300
- Yeah, definitely, definitely. Like, a
lot of things make this one surreal. What

202
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,860
does surreal mean again? Who remembers?

203
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,700
- Me? It means, like, not, like, like, not
real, but, like, in a different form.

204
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,500
- Right. Beyond real. Beyond real. Okay?
And this is a great example of that.

205
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:01,240
Beyond reality. Okay? Here's what I need
you to do now, okay? I have one more...

206
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,060
Oh, I might have to re- ...I have one
more slide that I want to show you up on

207
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,450
the board, and if you open up your
folders, you'll see this. You'll see this

208
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,650
slide. And I printed it out for you. What
I'm going to have you do right now, in the

209
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:23,360
next couple minutes, I'm going to have you
switch your drawing with someone at your

210
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,080
table. You might have to switch three
ways, or four ways, or one way. And I want

211
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,680
you to assess the drawing that you get.
Now, if you get one that has lots of

212
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,080
drawings, just pick one of them, okay?
Here's what I want you to do on the sheet.

213
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,110
This is easy. First thing. What's the
first thing that you notice about the

214
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,480
drawing that you just received? Write it
down. Maybe you noticed a big basketball.

215
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,160
Maybe you notice... whatever it is,
write it down. Then I want you to check

216
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,300
these little circles. Whichever of these
options that you see that that person

217
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,620
used, I want you to check them out. Okay,
Michael? And then I want you to write.

218
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,530
This is the one that everyone stumbles
with. They're like, "What does this mean?"

219
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,970
All I'm saying is, what do you think that
person meant in that drawing? What do you

220
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,530
think the meaning is? If you don't know,
put a question mark. All right? And then

221
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,110
what suggestions do you have for that
person? Maybe they, you know, if you did a

222
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,190
background, it would look really nice. Or
maybe, you know what? Maybe you've got to

223
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,760
lose something. You've got way too much
going on. I can't tell what it is. So this

224
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,130
is not going to take you very long, but
it's important because it shows that,

225
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,380
shows me that you understand what you're
looking at, and it also helps the person

226
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,080
get a better drawing, which is going to be
used for the painting. So I want you to

227
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,820
switch drawings right now. Everyone
switch. And I want you to use the sheet,

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,640
and I want you to fill it out based on the
new drawing that you're looking at, okay?

229
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,790
So you're going to do this independently,
and I'll come around and I'll check with

230
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,580
you in a little bit. That's the first
thing that you see. Write down the first

231
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,550
thing that you see, all right? So, Lily,
what's the first thing that you see in

232
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,090
your, in this picture?

233
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:00,780
- [inaudible].

234
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,970
- Okay. What do you think it is?
- [inaudible].

235
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:07,830
- Okay. What do you think this is as a
whole? Don't say anything, because I know

236
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,650
it's yours. But this is good, because this
is going to help you to make it better if

237
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,430
you need to. So what's the first thing
that you know? That you th-, what do you

238
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,130
see? Just maybe you recognize it just as
water. Anything else?

239
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,246
- Maybe a blanket
[inaudible].

240
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,774
- Okay. Write that down. Okay, that's a
good start. What's the first thing that

241
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:34,700
you saw? Almost everything is crooked.
That's a good ob-, that's a really good

242
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,230
observation. Because everything is
crooked. Good. So what options do you

243
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:45,580
think were used in this? Now, which one
did you select?

244
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:49,778
- Normal object acting abnormally.

245
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:54,070
- That's right. It's clearly these objects
are acting abnormally. That's good. That

246
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,670
was a good, that was another good
observation. So you just keep moving

247
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,590
through.
Did you write down your first reaction?

248
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,320
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,000
- Okay. And... okay. So normal objects
acting abnormally.
