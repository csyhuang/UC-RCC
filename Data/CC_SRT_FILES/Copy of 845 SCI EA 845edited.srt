1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:01,545
- Ah, okay.

2
00:00:04,044 --> 00:00:05,608
Okay.

3
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:10,560
- Suri does this only happens in vinegar

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,374
or can it happen in water?

5
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:13,973
- Try it tomorrow.

6
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to experiment
more with this, okay?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,810
This is, can I have your
attention up here again?

8
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:21,612
I'm just trying to help you

9
00:00:21,612 --> 00:00:24,375
by sharing observations I hear
when I go around the room.

10
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,529
Somebody had a question

11
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:27,829
and I love questions.

12
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,251
They said, does this happen when you put it

13
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:31,527
in water the same way that it happens

14
00:00:31,527 --> 00:00:33,558
if you put it in vinegar
because I have told you all

15
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:34,432
it's vinegar.

16
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:35,915
If you have questions
like that could you please

17
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:37,764
write them on the side so that I know what

18
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:40,879
investigations you'd
like to do in the future?

19
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:42,023
So we can, because we're going to be

20
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:43,181
continuing this.

21
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:48,181
Now, once you've made
all of your observations,

22
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,226
you still have that column like we've had

23
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,563
from every little
activity today that says,

24
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:55,472
what could be happening.

25
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,118
So, let me be more specific.

26
00:00:57,118 --> 00:01:00,308
I want you to tell me,
again, the title of the lab

27
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:02,935
is, where's the matter?

28
00:01:02,935 --> 00:01:05,611
I want you to tell me
where that tablet went.

29
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,256
I want you to look at your observations.

30
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:08,902
I want you to be specific.

31
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,092
And I want you to tell
me where's the matter.

32
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,388
What happened to the tablet?

33
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:17,293
Okay, in that last column
you should only have one box

34
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:18,370
to fill in.

35
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,995
Please discuss it with your lab group

36
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:22,799
and write down where it went.

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,404
What happened to it.

38
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:27,153
And then we'll all discuss it together.

39
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:32,929
(students chatting)

40
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,473
- It can do both, can't it?

41
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:35,875
So, you think it turned into a gas.

42
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:38,659
You think it dissolved
and turned into a gas okay,

43
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,670
so you can absolutely write both.

44
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,698
Next thing we're going to talk about

45
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:43,953
is how we prove that.

46
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:45,802
So, if any of you guys
have a really quick idea

47
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:48,057
think about how you can do an experiment.

48
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,852
Okay, so keep thinking along those lines

49
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,434
because you're going to design
your experiment for it, okay.

50
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:02,976
I have balloons.

51
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,721
I see the word dissolves.

52
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:16,223
I saw the word fizzy and escape.

53
00:02:19,163 --> 00:02:20,246
Okay.

54
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:25,128
Alright, I'm going to write down

55
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,674
some of these words that I'm seeing.

56
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,557
I saw dissolved.

57
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,753
I know.

58
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:35,374
I saw escaped.

59
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,463
Fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped,

60
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:42,580
but thank you for reminding me.

61
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,740
Did you have fizzy separately?

62
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:45,942
- Yeah.

63
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:46,804
- Oh, okay.

64
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,622
On your observation sight
or what could happen?

65
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:50,882
- Yeah, what could happen.

66
00:02:50,882 --> 00:02:52,832
- What could happen, okay.

67
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:56,333
- Blended, okay.

68
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:01,813
- I had gas.

69
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,424
- You had chemical reaction?

70
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:06,740
- Bubbles.

71
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:15,653
- Did I pretty much
get the kinds of things

72
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,772
you think may have happened?

73
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:26,204
Any, any totally different
ideas that you think happened?

74
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,581
You think it was still...

75
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,877
- It became carbon dioxide.

76
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,132
- Okay, alright.

77
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,459
Alright, focus up here then.

78
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:39,897
Good.

79
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,345
I see the same mixture.

80
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:46,521
When I did the first demonstration

81
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:48,491
first thing you said was magic.

82
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,363
Then someone said chemical reaction.

83
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,969
Dissolved, disappeared,
changed, neutralized.

84
00:03:54,085 --> 00:03:56,645
I see the same combination of words.

85
00:03:56,645 --> 00:03:58,900
Dissolved, escaped,
fizzy, blended, vanished,

86
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,668
chemical reaction, magic.

87
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:04,548
I just see a little
different priority, okay.

88
00:04:04,548 --> 00:04:07,318
Now I'm a scientist.

89
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,182
I can't really test magic.

90
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,127
Can't really test if something was magic.

91
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,568
What I can test are
the science type words.

92
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:18,606
I can test chemical reaction.

93
00:04:19,595 --> 00:04:21,349
I can test blended.

94
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,721
I can sort of test fizzy.

95
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:29,110
Escaped, dissolved. These I can test.

96
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,217
I can try to figure out a way

97
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:35,997
to determine whether the
tablet dissolved or escaped.

98
00:04:37,731 --> 00:04:39,586
Or a combination of both.

99
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,465
I can figure out if it
being fizzy had something

100
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:43,379
to do with it.

101
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,004
I can figure out if it was blended in.

102
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,077
I can figure out if it
was a chemical reaction

103
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:48,275
or I can let you do this.

104
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,008
And that's what I'm going to do.

105
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,582
On your other half sheet,

106
00:04:54,472 --> 00:04:56,017
you should have another half sheet

107
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:57,361
on your table.

108
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,291
First thing I need you to do is,

109
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,441
in your group, I need you
to come to a consensus.

110
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,108
That means you guys have got to agree.

111
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:11,901
The first question on there says, okay,

112
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,914
where's the disappearing matter?

113
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,403
But I asked you to think about it

114
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,782
in terms of everything you've seen today.

115
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:25,189
I magically changed clear
liquid into pink liquid

116
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,954
and then pink liquid back
into clear liquid again.

117
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,519
You saw a candle magically get shorter

118
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,197
and the wick magically disappearing

119
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:38,813
and some black stuff come out of nowhere

120
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:41,806
and you saw an alka-seltzer tablet vanish.

121
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:43,858
Okay.

122
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,687
So, your group needs to agree

123
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,538
on an overall theory.

124
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:54,712
Where's the disappearing matter?

125
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:56,602
I want you to discuss
it and I want you all to

126
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:59,243
write the exact same sentence

127
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,496
for where's the disappearing
matter at the top

128
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,680
of your paper.

129
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,830
Okay, so you have to agree.

130
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,325
- There was a small piece
that I put in right now

131
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:18,325
and the alka-seltzer went up.

132
00:06:18,973 --> 00:06:20,436
- So, you know that it goes to the bottom

133
00:06:20,436 --> 00:06:21,667
not to the top.

134
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,628
Okay.

135
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:25,635
That's a great observation
because its very specific.

136
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,301
I like it.

137
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,464
So, you all need to talk about...

138
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:34,873
Okay so, in every single experiment it turned

139
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:36,003
into a gas?

140
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,502
So, the pink liquid turned into a gas?

141
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:40,696
And the white liquid turned into a gas?

142
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,561
And when the clear liquid
went pink liquid,

143
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:48,646
the wax turned into a gas?

144
00:06:50,245 --> 00:06:52,547
I didn't even see it disappear.

145
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,203
Oh, when you blew it out you saw smoke,

146
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:56,787
so when you blew it out,

147
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,392
the amount of smoke that went off,

148
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:00,851
do you think it was equal
to the amount of candle

149
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:02,076
that's missing?

150
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,743
- Oh, the liquid was a
solid, this is a gas, so...

151
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,413
- Tell me about the liquid again.

152
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,052
Because I only saw liquid so I keep...

153
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:20,091
(students speaking)

154
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,671
- If the pink was less
dense than the white.

155
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:43,441
(students speaking)

156
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,953
- If the density explained it,

157
00:07:59,953 --> 00:08:02,127
have you ever seen liquids that

158
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:04,551
have different densities combined?

159
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,183
Have you ever seen oil in water?

160
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,631
Okay, so what does it look like when

161
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,994
you have two different density liquids?

162
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:18,001
Did you see layers with the...

163
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:22,206
(students speaking)

164
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:33,523
- Where'd the pink stuff go?

165
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,814
Disappeared by itself?

166
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,505
Okay. So, these are the things you

167
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:44,887
guys have to talk about.

168
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:45,882
You can't just take one person's,

169
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:49,092
you guys gotta make sure you all agree

170
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:52,213
and it has to be an explanation

171
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:54,549
that explains all three events

172
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,161
that we saw today.

173
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:59,121
So, when I say where's
the disappearing matter,

174
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,604
you tell me it turned into a gas.

175
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:03,245
I'm going to say, okay then the pink liquid

176
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:05,344
turned into a gas? I didn't see bubbles.

177
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,400
Okay.

178
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:09,224
So, it has to be a sentence
that explains it all.

179
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:12,069
You guys aren't talking here.

180
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,247
Okay.

181
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,645
The disappearing matter is in the liquid.

182
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,758
So, you still think the
alka-seltzer tablet is in there?

183
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,374
(students speaking)

184
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:25,498
Okay, so you think it's in
there, but it's now bubbles?

185
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,469
Okay.

186
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:29,141
It's in there, but it's now bubbles

187
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,112
so it changed in to bubbles

188
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,972
and then what about the pink
liquid and the clear liquid?

189
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:36,725
You think it's all still in there?

190
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:40,972
Okay, but that time no bubbles,

191
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:42,495
but it's still in there.

192
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,425
Okay, so candle.

193
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:47,006
Where did the rest of the wick go?

194
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,667
Is it still there?

195
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,013
Okay, so you were good for two out of three,

196
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:56,102
but you can't say it's still in there

197
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:00,523
for the candle, so change your sentence.

198
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,164
Talk about it.

199
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,487
Change your sentence just a little bit.

200
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,573
I get that you're saying that.

201
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:08,708
Right.

202
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:10,490
But change your sentence a little bit

203
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,747
so it applies to all three events. Okay.

204
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:19,029
What's your sentence that
everyone has agreed on?

205
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:21,862
- That matter turns into...

206
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,535
- So, you had bubbles in your candle?

207
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:26,937
- No.

208
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,470
- Oh, this is supposed to be, to explain

209
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,813
all three events we saw today.

210
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,759
Okay.

211
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,109
This is a good start,

212
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:38,721
but it has to be more general.

213
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:43,231
Where is the disappearing
matter in general today?

214
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,658
Dissolved is good for this one?

215
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:56,640
Is this one dissolved?

216
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:58,167
- Nope.

217
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,575
- Okay, so can you think of something

218
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,491
dissolved and melted have in common

219
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:04,354
so you can make it one sentence

220
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:05,884
to explain everything.

221
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:10,110
(student speaking)

222
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,346
- Okay, doesn't show up anymore does that mean

223
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:16,734
it's gone?

224
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,813
- Okay, that's where you have to agree.

225
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,982
You have to agree whether
it is gone or not.

226
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:26,547
Okay?

227
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,508
Okay, stop for just one second.

228
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:39,812
I talked to a couple of really good groups,

229
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:42,683
but a couple of groups are very stuck

230
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,182
because they disagree.

231
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:46,943
I told you you all had to agree

232
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,134
and you had to explain all three things.

233
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,964
It's like the most difficult
thing you can possibly do.

234
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:53,646
He won't listen to you. I hear you.

235
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,027
Okay, I'm listening.

236
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,283
Here's the thing.

237
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:02,599
In the disagreements I've
seen, the disagreement is

238
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,353
is it gone or is it not gone?

239
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:06,933
Does that make sense?

240
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:07,990
Okay.

241
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:11,017
Did it go away? Did it disappear
or is it still in there?

242
00:12:11,762 --> 00:12:13,089
That's the disagreement.

243
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,608
Now, I have an idea.

244
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,652
What if we, let's pick one experiment, okay.

245
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:24,115
I think for this class,
the easiest experiment

246
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:26,411
to deal with would be the tablet.

247
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,941
The alka-seltzer and the vinegar, okay.

248
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:30,170
Write that down on that half sheet

249
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,821
as the experiment we chose.

250
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,280
The experiment, we chose the alka-seltzer.

251
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,657
We're going to choose that as a class.

252
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,420
What are the materials we put in?

253
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:42,000
(students speaking)

254
00:12:42,725 --> 00:12:44,154
- The tablet

255
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,348
and the vinegar.

256
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:47,927
Write those down on that left side.

257
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:49,619
It says materials we put in.

258
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,401
Do we put in anything else?

259
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,742
I didn't trick you, I swear.

260
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:55,023
Okay, so we had vinegar
and we had a tablet.

261
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:59,493
What did you see come out?

262
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,362
- Bubbles.

263
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:04,186
- We've got bubbles so write
those on the right hand side.

264
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,279
We've got bubbles.

265
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,142
Fizz.

266
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,184
He thinks, he's saying he thinks the
fizz is carbon dioxide.

267
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,307
That's fine.

268
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,183
We can call it whatever you want

269
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:18,431
and what some kind of guess

270
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,638
and what else?

271
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:20,918
Are you left with anything else?

272
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,067
You're still left with some liquid, right?

273
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,505
Okay, so write that down.

274
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:27,901
You're left with, you've got bubbles

275
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,878
and you're left with bubbly liquid.

276
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:34,734
Here's what I think we need to prove.

277
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,147
We need to prove if what we put in

278
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:40,808
is the same as what we got out.

279
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,471
How we can tell if something's there

280
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:49,281
if we can't see it in science?

281
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:52,688
Okay, you've got bubbles.

282
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:55,965
What do you think, Nick?

283
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:01,629
We weigh the vinegar and the alka-seltzer tablet 
(mumbles) we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards
and see of the number's the same.
