1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,607
- [Teacher] Trying to find
meaning for their lives,

2
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:02,861
or were they just trying to,

3
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:05,526
what were they questing for, do you think?

4
00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:08,039
- [Blonde girl] Well,
Gilgamesh was questing

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,303
for like immortality,

6
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,763
and that was for him,

7
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,933
and not really his people,

8
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:18,741
but Theseus I think was,

9
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,501
I don't know.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,237
- [Girl with short hair] I think Theseus

11
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:27,926
was just trying to help
the people of Athens.

12
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,203
I don't think either of them

13
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:31,223
were really looking to find that,

14
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:32,936
but they both ended up finding it.

15
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:34,474
- [Girl in green] I think both of them

16
00:00:34,474 --> 00:00:36,860
were like looking to help their people,

17
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:39,280
and then I also think
like a small part of them

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,598
was looking for glory.

19
00:00:41,648 --> 00:00:43,343
- [Girl in white] I think it's kind 
of like looking for their destiny,

20
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,921
like they know they're
meant for something bigger,

21
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,569
but they don't know what it is yet,

22
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:50,861
so they're just looking
for what that is, so....

23
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:54,318
- [Haley] Then he goes to take the test,

24
00:00:54,318 --> 00:00:58,771
and the test kills him. Or not.

25
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:01,122
Then, he goes back to his father,

26
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:06,122
and he realizes that he's just like,

27
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:08,575
you know, the father's really
disappointed in the son,

28
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,293
and then he's really
disappointed until the son,

29
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:13,037
I think it could happen
in today's society.

30
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:15,155
I don't know about Gilgamesh.

31
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:15,852
- [Girl in red shirt] Well yeah, it 
was a really like--

32
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:18,470
- [Haley] Abstract, connecting--

33
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:21,094
- [Girl in red shirt] In the really broad
sense, it could happen,

34
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:21,935
but like --

35
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:22,864
- [Haley] Like the story line.

36
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,443
- [Girl in red shirt] But when you 
look at details, then like, no.

37
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:25,691
- [Haley] But I mean, minotaurs don't exist.

38
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:27,129
So it probably couldn't happen.

39
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,431
- [Girl in red shirt] But like you 
were saying, like metaphorically,

40
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,237
it could be something, that, you know.

41
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,560
- [Haley] Like the storyline could happen.

42
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:37,299
- [Boy in blue] But metaphorically, you
could compare anything.

43
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:38,302
- [Girl in white shirt] That's true.

44
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:41,479
- [Teacher] Can you explain
more of what you mean

45
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,076
by metaphorically?

46
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:44,701
- [Girl in red shirt] Like me.

47
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:46,280
- [Girl with bangs] No, the 
only one was like (Background Chatter)

48
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:47,534
- [Teacher] You mean hypothetical.

49
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:49,072
- [Girl with bangs] Theseus, not like he

50
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,906
goes and fights a minotaur,

51
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,183
and when he comes back,

52
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:53,600
he's like not dead,

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,271
but his dad thinks he's
dead and kills himself.

54
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,913
But it's like Haley said, I guess.

55
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,706
- [Haley] Thanks!

56
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:01,750
- [Girl with bangs] If you have like a test,
and like you're bad--

57
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,398
- [Girl in red shirt] Like a difficult situation 
in general.

58
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:06,347
- [Girl with bangs] Yeah, and like your dad or
parents or someone are like,

59
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:09,226
"You can get through this,"
like, "You can beat it,"

60
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:10,875
and they think that you,

61
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,545
or like they think that you fail it,

62
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:15,402
or like catastrophe fail it,

63
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:16,656
or they think you do,

64
00:02:16,656 --> 00:02:19,257
then they're gonna be kind
of disappointed in you,

65
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:20,998
but like they're not gonna
necessarily kill themselves

66
00:02:20,998 --> 00:02:22,618
because you failed a test.

67
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:26,918
- [Haley] But still.

68
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,472
- [Teacher] You can laugh
if it was someone else.

69
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:31,776
- [Haley] But maybe like on the inside, he's dying.

70
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,450
- [Girl with bangs] Yeah.

71
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,814
- [Haley] Your turn.

72
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,743
- [Girl in red shirt] Okay, I just said, what
factors have to be changed

73
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:41,037
to make this apply to modern times?

74
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,992
- [Haley] Well, the--

75
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:45,105
- [Girl in white shirt] Probably the 
whole like

76
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:48,936
fantasy aspect of it
would have to be changed.

77
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,440
- [Girl in red shirt] At least like 
in the...

78
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:52,721
to the culture, like the
gods and goddesses aren't

79
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,039
like a, you know--

80
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,368
- [Girl with bangs] Big deal?

81
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:56,157
- [Girl in red shirt] Yeah.

82
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:58,387
- [Haley] I think that the gods and goddesses

83
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,755
kind of like connect with like

84
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,937
the people that are, not like in charge,

85
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:04,725
but that are higher up in our society,

86
00:03:04,725 --> 00:03:08,046
like the government people,
and like parents and--

87
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,833
- [Girl in red shirt] I just think 
more like mentors, in general.

88
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,829
- [Haley] Yeah, like people
that are higher than us.

89
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,547
- [Girl in red shirt] Like anyone 
technically could like, you know,

90
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,915
that you look up to, that
you rely on for help.

91
00:03:16,915 --> 00:03:18,703
- [Haley] It's like a figure,
rather than like-- - Yeah.

92
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:19,493
- [Girl in red shirt] A physical--

93
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:20,537
- [Haley] Yeah, god.

94
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:22,181
- [Girl in red shirt] God. Yeah.

95
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,995
- [Haley] Well my question was,
show the similarities

96
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,149
and differences between
Theseus and his father.

97
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,634
- [Girl in white shirt] Ooh, okay.

98
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:33,031
So, I think

99
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,781
like they both kind of,

100
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,794
they're very different
in their terms of like

101
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:40,373
loss and like failure.

102
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,606
Because like when Theseus's dad

103
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,393
like thought that he was like dead,

104
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,221
then he jumped off a cliff
and committed suicide.

105
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:52,707
But when like Theseus like
was with Ariadne or whatever,

106
00:03:52,707 --> 00:03:55,517
and she like helped him to
like defeat the minotaur,

107
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:58,994
then he just kind of, you
know, left her on an island.

108
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,731
- [Haley] I think that,

109
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,057
I don't really remember how he got

110
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:09,193
in the situation of having to give

111
00:04:09,623 --> 00:04:12,997
the people on Crete

112
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,462
seven maidens and seven children,

113
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:19,921
but like, I just think
that because that happens,

114
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:21,152
and because he does that every year,

115
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:23,404
I think Theseus is a better leader,

116
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:26,440
he's just like better in charge of--

117
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,930
- [Girl with bangs] I think that they're 
definitely like

118
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,161
different rulers, too.

119
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:31,391
Because like Theseus is more,

120
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,713
like including the people like when

121
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:38,713
he goes and like he led
his army against Thebes,

122
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,934
but doesn't try to like--

123
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,465
most people would like try to steal stuff

124
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:44,789
from the city,

125
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,575
but he's just going to like bury the dead,

126
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:49,590
and then he leaves.

127
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:54,025
So like that's more of
a nicer leader I guess,

128
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:59,348
whereas his dad wasn't really like

129
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:01,763
put in that situation,

130
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:03,830
but I'm guessing that he
would be one of those people

131
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,823
who would probably take
stuff from that city,

132
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:11,649
and not include people very often.

133
00:05:12,931 --> 00:05:14,296
- [Haley] It says that (Background Chatter)

134
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,422
- [Girl in gray] Because he lived 
with his mom,

135
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:21,878
so he didn't want to have a son.

136
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:23,927
So then when he could lift the rock,

137
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,732
then he could come over and meet his dad.

138
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,870
- [Boy on far right] Is this question number--

139
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,083
- [Girl in brown] No, we're still asking,

140
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,615
predict what would happen

141
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,164
if King Aegeus and Enkidu hadn't died.

142
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:36,186
- [Girl in dark jacket] If the king hadn't died,

143
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:38,276
I think the son would have come back

144
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:41,736
and they just would have
lived happily ever after,

145
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:43,007
and there would have been no like--

146
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:46,374
- [Girl in brown](Background Chatter)
--not formed,

147
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:48,167
you know what I'm talking about?

148
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,537
Because King Aegeus--

149
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:50,582
- [Girl in gray] No, but he 
would have died sometime,

150
00:05:50,582 --> 00:05:52,115
and then Theseus would have taken over.

151
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,479
- [Girl in brown] Yeah, that's true.

152
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:55,899
- [Teacher] Can you go, dig a little
deeper with what you said

153
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:57,014
about the democracy?

154
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:57,827
What did you mean by that?

155
00:05:57,827 --> 00:05:59,429
- [Girl in brown] Oh, just like 
right when King Aegeus died,

156
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:01,240
Theseus came over and said,

157
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,354
"We're going to have a democracy

158
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:03,794
"instead of me ruling over all of you."

159
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:06,093
So like, we don't know if
that would have happened,

160
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:07,439
or because if he just
would have stayed alive,

161
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,948
he could have like changed Theseus' mind

162
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,015
and made him think a
democracy was a bad idea.

163
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:11,851
- [Teacher] Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:12,478
- [Girl in brown] Yeah.

165
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:13,476
He would've wanted him to be--

166
00:06:13,476 --> 00:06:14,475
he would have that as king.

167
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,775
He would've been more like his dad.

168
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,279
- [Girl in dark jacket] Yeah, that's true.

169
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:18,399
- [Girl in gray] But if Enkidu didn't die,

170
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,649
then Gilgamesh would
probably like be happy,

171
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:23,716
and then like, conquer
a bunch of other stuff,

172
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,893
and like they would
probably like die together.

173
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,570
- [Boy in crew cut] She
could have sent him to Athens

174
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,056
to claim him as his--

175
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,310
- [Girl in brown](Background Chatter)

176
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,117
- [Boy in crew cut] Oh, okay, nevermind.

177
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:34,675
- [Boy on far right] You're allowed to go on.

178
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:35,610
- [Boy in crew cut] All right.

179
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,185
- [Girl in dark jacket] No, if
Enkidu didn't die, though,

180
00:06:39,185 --> 00:06:42,413
I just think that Gilgamesh
wouldn't have really known--

181
00:06:42,413 --> 00:06:43,713
like you know how they said he was

182
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,379
really arrogant in the beginning?

183
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:46,941
I think he still was kind of arrogant,

184
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,519
until Enkidu died, so he--

185
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,286
- [Girl] He would have stayed like that.

186
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,563
- [Girl in brown] Yeah, he would have stayed that way.

187
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,724
- [Girl in brown] Mm-hmm. Because
he went through like

188
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:52,908
a stage of depression, so.

189
00:06:52,908 --> 00:06:53,511
- [Girl in dark jacket] Yeah.

190
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,974
- [Teacher] Do you think that each
one reached humility

191
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:56,205
at the end, or no?

192
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:57,616
Do you think that Gilgamesh, you said,

193
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,502
was still arrogant, even at the end?

194
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,570
- [Girl in dark jacket] No.
- [Teacher] Oh, he wasn't?

195
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,138
- [Girl in dark jacket] Not after Enkidu
died, but once he died,

196
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:05,875
it stopped of course, but--

197
00:07:06,066 --> 00:07:08,736
- [Boy with crew cut] I think Gilgamesh

198
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,106
was arrogant until he found out

199
00:07:10,106 --> 00:07:11,912
that he wasn't going to be immortal.

200
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:15,609
- [Girl in brown jacket] Well yeah, that, too.

201
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,675
Because then he had to like
live his life to the fullest

202
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,295
because he couldn't live forever.

203
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:20,921
He couldn't do whatever he wanted.

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,366
- [Girl in dark jacket] Who's your favorite

205
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,566
character between each story?

206
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,400
Out of the stories?

207
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:27,422
- [Girl in brown] Theseus.

208
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,814
- [Girl in dark jacket] Yeah, I like Theseus, too.

209
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:31,601
- [Boy in crew cut] We all like Theseus.

210
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:32,391
- [Boy on far right] Yeah.

211
00:07:34,511 --> 00:07:36,719
- [Boy in white] It also said that Theseus

212
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,848
was grieving.

213
00:07:42,392 --> 00:07:45,441
- [Girl in maroon] Was grieving her loss,
or his father's loss?

214
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:48,878
- [Boy in white] It was both.

215
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,688
- [Girl in white] Debate which character 
had more impact

216
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:53,936
on their society.

217
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,538
- [Teacher] Can you say that one more time?

218
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,030
- [Girl in white] Debate which character 
had more impact

219
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,232
on their society.

220
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,141
- [Teacher] Oh, she has the "debate" word in there.

221
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,297
Okay, let's hear it.

222
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:05,090
- [Boy in yellow] I'd say Gilgamesh--

223
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,657
- [Girl in gray] I would say--

224
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:07,661
- [Boy in yellow] ...he wants to be king.

225
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:09,583
- [Teacher] Let's let him finish his reason.

226
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:10,749
What's your reason?

227
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:11,608
You think who?

228
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,535
- [Boy in yellow] I think Gilgamesh.

229
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,439
Actually, I think Theseus would,

230
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,439
because he changed the kind
of structure of government,

231
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:24,257
and made it democratic.

232
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,002
That's it.

233
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:30,887
- [Girl in maroon] Yeah, I would agree

234
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,162
with you there in the way that

235
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:34,440
he kind of completely changed

236
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,272
the government structure where he lived,

237
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:39,621
while kind of Gilgamesh would probably

238
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,405
be one of those leaders
that is better forgotten

239
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,494
than remembered, and memory lived on

240
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:49,094
is not probably a theme in that story.

241
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,439
While Theseus kind of left his ways

242
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,918
and his story behind.

243
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:56,315
That people remembered on high,

244
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:59,212
rather than as like a low
point of their society.

245
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,720
- [Teacher] Weren't you
going to say something?

246
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:03,183
- [Girl in gray] Oh, I was?

247
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:05,598
- [Teacher] I thought you were.

248
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:08,821
- [Girl in gray] I think Theseus was, had an impact.

249
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,332
- [Teacher] And the reason for that?

250
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:18,654
- [Girl in gray] Because he like survived more

251
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:21,812
than Gilgamesh did, and he
helped people out of the maze,

252
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,638
with Adrian's help, right? Yeah.

253
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:29,265
Predict what would happen if the King

254
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:32,836
and Enkidu didn't die.

255
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:41,374
- [Girl in maroon] Well--

256
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,912
- [Boy in blue] I don't think 
Athens would be democratic.

257
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,768
I don't think the king would have done it.

258
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,718
- [Girl in maroon] Yeah, he probably
would have been poisoned.

259
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:51,413
- [Teacher] Why is that?

260
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,573
- [Boy in yellow] Gilgamesh--

261
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,925
- [Boy in blue] I don't know, because--

262
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:56,084
- [Boy in yellow] Gilgamesh probably
wouldn't have been searching

263
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,200
for immortality.

264
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:00,766
- [Girl in maroon] Yeah, he wouldn't have
gone on that Journey.

265
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,454
- [Boy in yellow] Yeah.

266
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:09,101
- [Girl in maroon] Okay, well my question is:

267
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,727
how would you have handled some of the

268
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:13,095
tough situations that
each of the characters

269
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,390
had to go through?

270
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,965
- [Girl in gray] Wait, what was the question?

271
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,823
- [Girl in maroon] How would you have
handled the situations?

272
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:23,136
- [Teacher] Wouldn't have done any of them?

273
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,294
- [Girl in gray] No, I get scared 
really easily, and stressed,

274
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:27,943
so that would not be good.

275
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:32,954
- [Boy in yellow] (mumbles) the Labyrinth thing.

276
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:34,742
- [Teacher] Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

277
00:10:34,887 --> 00:10:36,507
- [Boy in yellow] I wouldn't go to 
the Labyrinth thing.

278
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:38,109
- [Teacher] Why is that?

279
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,156
- [Boy in yellow] It kind of sounds like a bad idea.

280
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,945
- [Girl in maroon] I might go and 
just not defeat the beast,

281
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:48,686
and in the first place, I probably would

282
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:50,056
have traveled by water,

283
00:10:50,056 --> 00:10:53,306
and not just said, "I'm too
good for that, it's too easy."

284
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:55,303
Because, I--

285
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:58,061
- [Boy in yellow] Bandits have sharp swords.

286
00:10:58,113 --> 00:10:59,013
- [Girl in maroon] Yeah.

287
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:06,629
- [Girl in gray] Okay, what's yours?

288
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,692
- [Boy in black] Choose your favorite
character and explain why.

289
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,825
From, because you like
Gilgamesh or Theseus.

290
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:15,940
- [Girl in gray] Okay.

291
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:18,917
Oh, not like our favorite
character, just in the story?

292
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:22,464
- [Boy in black] Yeah. Well either way,
it doesn't really matter.

293
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,979
- [Girl in gray] Well because my 
favorite character from Gilgamesh

294
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:27,085
was Enkidu? Is that how you say it?

295
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,016
Because I think he like really changed

296
00:11:30,016 --> 00:11:31,775
Gilgamesh for the better.

297
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,190
And helped him and humbled him.

298
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:42,926
- [Teacher] Do you agree with that?

299
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:43,948
- [Girl in green] Yeah, I agree with that,

300
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:47,105
because I feel like he was kind of--

301
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,358
like Gilgamesh was so awful,

302
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,949
and like Enkidu came in
and just changed all that.

303
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:54,882
Plus, I thought that it was kind of cool,

304
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:58,197
his journey from like a
savage to the civilized guy.

305
00:11:58,365 --> 00:11:59,056
Yeah.

306
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,268
- [Girl with short hair] I don't think that Enkidu

307
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:01,662
really meant to change Gilgamesh, though,

308
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,542
I think that it was just the circumstances

309
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,346
surrounding his death
that made that happen.

310
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:09,254
- [Girl in green] Enkidu's mom kind of made
that happen, too, didn't he?

311
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:11,855
- [Teacher] Did you feel like Enkidu
was just kind of created,

312
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,014
that he, I mean we were
saying that we like him,

313
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:16,824
but did he seem real to you,

314
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,542
or was he just something created?

315
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,771
- [Girl white] See, when I read it, the entire time,

316
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,139
he just kind of seemed like this robot

317
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,272
that the gods had
created to fix Gilgamesh,

318
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:30,360
so he didn't really have that
much of a personality to me,

319
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,304
so that's my opinion, I don't know.

320
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:35,120
- [Girl in green] Yeah, he seemed 
like his pretty much

321
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,368
sole purpose of existence was

322
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:39,257
to balance out Gilgamesh.

323
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,328
- [Girl with short hair] And he did.

324
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,275
- [Girl in green] Yeah, he did.

325
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,813
- [Boy in black] My favorite character 
from these stories

326
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:47,360
was Ariadne.

327
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:48,312
- [Teacher] Oh.

328
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:50,361
- [Boy in black] Well, because I 
didn't feel sorry for her,

329
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:52,311
because she helped Theseus,

330
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,865
and like without her, he
would have been trapped

331
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,165
in the Labyrinth.

332
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:59,829
But then to repay her, he
just ditched her on an island,

333
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,020
and just left her, so
that wasn't very nice.

334
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:08,257
So I feel sorry for her, that's why.

335
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,931
- [Girl in gray] Okay, mine is:
how would you have dealt

336
00:13:11,931 --> 00:13:15,037
with these situations in (mumbles)

337
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:16,157
- [Teacher] Can you repeat it one more time?

338
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,638
- [Girl in gray] How would you have 
handled these situa--

339
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,747
(audio cuts out)

340
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,834
- [Girl in green] I wouldn't run away from the--

341
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:28,444
(audio cuts out)

342
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:31,292
- [Girl in green] I would not have gone 
on this journey.

343
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:33,870
I probably just would have
stayed home, not gonna lie.

344
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:36,545
- [Teacher] Do you feel like, that
people, to be great,

345
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,496
have to go out in the world

346
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:40,841
and seek these amazing achievements,

347
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,716
that that's what greatness is?

348
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:44,416
- [Students] Not necessarily.

349
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,320
- [Girl in white] I don't think you
necessarily have to seek them.

350
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
It all really depends on what your

351
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,192
definition of greatness is.

352
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:54,790
- [Girl in green] I feel like to get that
like glory and all that,

353
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:56,856
I mean, I think you can do that,

354
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:00,368
if you have enough impact where you are,

355
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,220
you don't need to go off on a journey.

356
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:08,787
- [Teacher] What do you think, Dinesh?

357
00:14:09,443 --> 00:14:12,154
- [Girl with short hair] I don't know, I feel like,

358
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:15,828
if we're going by the
definitons as you would see them

359
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:20,240
within these stories, that
obviously you don't have to,

360
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,119
I don't think you have to
seek greatness, necessarily,

361
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,550
I don't think you have
to seek it to find it,

362
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,874
but I think that you do have to go off,

363
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:32,732
if you're just going
to stay where you are,

364
00:14:32,732 --> 00:14:33,777
you're not really going to

365
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,146
be able to achieve it.

366
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,632
- [Teacher] So if you just sit on your front porch

367
00:14:36,632 --> 00:14:39,721
and watch your life go
by, that's not greatness.

368
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,640
That can't constitute--
