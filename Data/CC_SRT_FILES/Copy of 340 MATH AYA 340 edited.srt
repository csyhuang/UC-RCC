1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[Voiceover] They're right angles.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,399
- Okay, so...

3
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,606
- [Voiceover] They're equal
because of Right Angles Theorem

4
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:13,378
- You are skipping a step.

5
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:16,202
Again. Trevor, tell him the
definition of an altitude.

6
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,860
You tell me I have an altitude.

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,574
You have to tell me then

8
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,802
what's the consequence of an altitude.

9
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:23,397
Read the definition of
an altitude. Say it.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,831
- The definition of an altitude is that

11
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:31,831
it intersects the
opposite side of the angle

12
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:36,183
at a perpendicular angle.

13
00:00:37,543 --> 00:00:40,053
I don't know how to word that right, 
but...

14
00:00:40,053 --> 00:00:40,824
- Somebody help him out.

15
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:43,831
He's making sense, but somebody... 
Yes.

16
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:52,552
- Alright.
It goes through the opposite vertex

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:57,552
and it intersects the
opposite line perpendicularly,

18
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:01,115
if that's a word.

19
00:01:01,115 --> 00:01:04,056
- Don't say through because
an altitude is bounded.

20
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:07,504
It starts at a vertex and it goes...

21
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:10,701
Okay, so! Now, Isaac,

22
00:01:11,566 --> 00:01:14,231
What should be the
consequent step two there?

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,939
- [Isaac] Right here?

24
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,234
- Yes.

25
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:21,465
Whatever they gave you
in those definitions,

26
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:24,669
Trevor's and the improved
definition by Trey,

27
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,869
nobody said anything
about congruent angles.

28
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:27,989
What did we talk?

29
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,737
- [Student] That
they're both right angles.

30
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:32,126
- [Isaac] That they're right angles.

31
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,420
- No, we didn't.

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,561
- That BD is perpendicular to AC.

33
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,903
- Ah-ha!

34
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,533
- That's what I got.

35
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,995
- Nice. That's what it is.

36
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:41,913
So, just write on top of that, honey.

37
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:43,721
- [Isaac] Right here?

38
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,671
- Yeah, the step two,
you should have that.

39
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,071
Right? You have to go with the definitions

40
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:51,047
when you have a justification

41
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:52,814
because that's what reason says.

42
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:54,730
It comes from a defintion.

43
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,656
- [Isaac] And why is that 
because of...

44
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,262
- Tell him. Why is that?

45
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:00,788
- Definition of altitude.
- Definition of altitude.

46
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:14,477
[No dialogue]

47
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,282
- Okay. You see how when we were
working with the picture,

48
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,550
we put those boxes on the triangle.

49
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,524
What did those boxes say, indicate?

50
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:21,894
- [Isaac] That they're right angles.

51
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:23,417
- They're right angles, okay.

52
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:24,285
So, that should be...

53
00:02:24,285 --> 00:02:25,678
And why do we have right angles?

54
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,690
Somebody tell me.
Why do we have right angles?

55
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:29,697
- Definition of perpendicular lines.

56
00:02:29,697 --> 00:02:30,728
- Yes.

57
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:34,043
That's a consequence if you
have perpendicular lines.

58
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:39,316
- [Isaac] So, I'm going to write,
ADB and CDB are right angles?

59
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:42,794
- [Student] Yes.
- [Student] Yeah.

60
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,019
- Okay.

61
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:49,249
[No dialogue]

62
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,478
- [Teacher] You guys, the
rest of you might have started

63
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:53,841
with the fact that it's
an angle bisector, right?

64
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,654
- [Student] Yeah.
- [Student] Yeah.

65
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:56,411
- And that's okay if
you started with that.

66
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:58,645
It's okay. Doesn't matter.

67
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:02,175
You could have started with
the BD is congruent to BD.

68
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:04,734
You don't have to start with a given,

69
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,306
but that's traditionally the way we do it.

70
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:14,870
[No dialogue]

71
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,560
- I can't believe I got this.

72
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:20,042
It's because of...

73
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,476
- [Students] It's the definition
of perpendicular lines.

74
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:35,084
[No dialogue]

75
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,274
- [Isaac] What's this?

76
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:39,327
- Okay, wait. Breathe in and out.

77
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:41,288
Now, let's go see what's going on.

78
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,047
Okay, step to the side.

79
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,113
ADB and CDB.

80
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:52,433
Okay. Still, you need to have
an angle, a side, and an angle.

81
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,322
Do you have a congruent angle?

82
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,437
After all that work.

83
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:56,322
- [Isaac] I'm going to do that now.

84
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:58,503
- Okay, what are you going to put?

85
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:03,503
- [Isaac] Angle ADB
is congruent to angle CDB

86
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,408
because the definition of right angles.

87
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:08,709
- [Student] Nope!

88
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,069
- [Student] Right Angle Congruency

89
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,930
- [Isaac] Right Angle Congruency Theory.

90
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,049
- Well, I haven't...

91
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,232
- What is the definition of right angle?

92
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,670
- That all right angles are congruent.

93
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,504
- What's the definition of a right angle?

94
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,405
- 90 degrees
- It measures 90 degrees

95
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:23,966
- Yeah, yeah.

96
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:24,947
All right angles are congruent

97
00:04:24,947 --> 00:04:27,298
is the Right Angle Theorem
that he's writing.

98
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:44,351
[No dialogue]

99
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,876
Okay, let's see what we have.

100
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,818
If you would number them, that would help.

101
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:54,294
That's one. And what's the
consequence for after one?

102
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,951
- [Isaac] I'm trying.

103
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:15,421
[No dialogue]

104
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:18,222
I am old and somewhat blind from here.

105
00:05:18,222 --> 00:05:19,060
But I know...

106
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,591
Is that a "2" right under that?

107
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:23,190
At the perpendicular line,
you have "2". What is that?

108
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,689
- [Isaac] AD is perpendic...

109
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,236
- No, after that.

110
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:31,532
- [Isaac] Angle ADB
is congruent to angle CDB.

111
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,405
- Wait. He wrote it.

112
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,675
- [Isaac] It's all jumbled up
and it's all there, so...

113
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,958
- But, wait a minute.

114
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,846
Let's make sense out of this
because it has to flow, okay?

115
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,043
You know when you have
your perpendicular line,

116
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:51,938
What should be at the 
perpendicular line?

117
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,413
The direct consequence if
you have perpendicular lines,

118
00:05:55,413 --> 00:05:56,572
is what?

119
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,730
- [Isaac] That the angles are...

120
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:05,413
- Somebody, somebody

121
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:07,972
- [Students] That they're right angles.

122
00:06:07,974 --> 00:06:09,157
- [Isaac] I want to say that, 
but then--

123
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:11,589
(Laughter)

124
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:12,229
I just don't want to say 
something that's wrong

125
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,260
- No, you're fine.

126
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,690
You were not here yesterday.

127
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,847
And it seems you're doing great.

128
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,813
Hey, so, take the blue marker,
so that everybody can see.

129
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,933
Take the blue marker because
I would like to re-number it

130
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,217
so they can see it, okay?

131
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,019
So, re-number them again.

132
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,175
One is the given, the altitude.

133
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:28,780
- [Isaac] So, you want me 
to write over?

134
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,608
- Yes.

135
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,280
And then that's two. 
Now, what should be three?

136
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,020
Don't put three on that one.
What should be three?

137
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,828
Somebody tell him. 
What should be three?

138
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:37,896
- The angles.

139
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:38,936
- The right angles.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
- Yes.

141
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:51,166
- Okay, now, honey, after
you have right angles,

142
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,368
what are you going to say?

143
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:57,631
- [Isaac] That, uh, Definition
of Right Angle Theorem.

144
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:58,769
- No.

145
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,673
- Okay, so right angles. What
happens after right angles?

146
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,833
Because remember angles are angles.

147
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,708
I need to talk about angle congruency.

148
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:10,657
But, you haven't said that.
You talked about right angles.

149
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:12,244
So now, what are you going to say?

150
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:13,908
You have it there, honey.

151
00:07:17,532 --> 00:07:20,357
- [Isaac] Angle ADB
is congruent to angle CDE.

152
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,056
- Okay, so that should be the next step.

153
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:23,176
- [Isaac] That's four.

154
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,629
- Okay, you remember. Good. Great.

155
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,304
Remember when I asked
you at the beginning,

156
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:35,588
when we first started doing
proofs, to keep track.

157
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,541
So, you have mentioned an
angle congruent to an angle?

158
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,718
- [Isaac] Yeah, right here.

159
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,226
- Not yet, we haven't
touched that guy yet.

160
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,342
We don't even have a number for that guy.

161
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:47,524
He's just floating in there.

162
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,854
What angle is congruent to what angle?

163
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:51,156
Have you mentioned that one angle

164
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:52,538
is congruent to another angle?

165
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,499
- [Isaac] Yeah, ADB is--
- You just did right?

166
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:56,612
- Okay, go cross out one of the As.

167
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:59,160
I don't think you specifically did this,

168
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,222
but I've noticed that some of you.

169
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:02,725
I've noticed in Abby

170
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,913
and I would notice in a couple of you.

171
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,167
Taylor, that you were always...

172
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,255
After you prove something, you
found it within your proof.

173
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:11,949
You would kind of cross it out in here.

174
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,300
Okay, I found this.

175
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:16,413
Or some of you would come over here

176
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,149
and actually write it here.

177
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:20,772
It's like you're taking attendance.

178
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,220
I need angle for an angle.
I already have an angle.

179
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:25,627
Keeping going.

180
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,391
See what I'm doing here. I
showed you this way back.

181
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,173
Yeah.

182
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,613
- He's probably getting confused
because of number three.

183
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:33,237
How he put ADB--

184
00:08:33,237 --> 00:08:38,237
because it should be ABD
and DBC instead of ADB.

185
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,506
- [Isaac] Wait, what, what, what?

186
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,154
- Number three. The original number three.

187
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:45,199
- [Isaac] Yeah

188
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:47,154
- The B should be in
the middle instead of D.

189
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,499
- It should be ABD and DBC.
- That's right.

190
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,370
- [Student] That's why!

191
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,053
- [Student] That's why! Yeah!

192
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,080
- [Student] I didn't noticed that.

193
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,991
- [Student] Yeah, I thought he put that.

194
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,371
- [Isaac] You guys are smart.

195
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:03,822
Yeah, that's how you got confused
with everything else.

196
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,192
Okay, so now,

197
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:10,106
segment BE is congruent
to segment BE because of

198
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,567
reflexive property, so that's
another side.

199
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:20,576
And then it's given that
BD is an angle bisector,

200
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,502
so that means angle ABD

201
00:09:25,672 --> 00:09:30,131
is congruent to angle CBD

202
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,083
- [Teacher] Okay, but the issue here is

203
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,958
he hasn't listed that as a given, right?

204
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,657
Just like people say, "Well,
you're making that up.

205
00:09:36,657 --> 00:09:37,582
"How do you know that?"

206
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:39,787
And you just say, "It's given,"
but you didn't write it, --

207
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,230
- Yeah, he did.
- Yeah, yeah he did.

208
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,996
- It's right there.

209
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:42,742
- It's number four.

210
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,692
- [Student] He just did it wrong.

211
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:45,730
- [Student] It's backwards.

212
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,831
- [Student] It's all there.

213
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,642
- [Teacher] So, that should
be step... Wait a minute.

214
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,797
One, two, three...

215
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:55,518
four, five...
- Four should be one

216
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:57,445
- [Student] Whoa.
- Three should be two

217
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:58,810
- One should be...

218
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:07,853
- [Isaac] So, there's
a one, two, three, four...

219
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,576
and then five...

220
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,345
Wait, five, right here.

221
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,432
- [Student] Six right above it.

222
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:20,271
- [Isaac] six, seven.

223
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,862
- [Teacher] Okay, can
you change the numbers?

224
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,752
- [Student] Fix the numbers.

225
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:25,485
- [Teacher] Yeah,
please fix the numbers.

226
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,316
- [Isaac] It's there.

227
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:34,072
- Okay, we got it.
We have an angle bisector,

228
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:35,836
the consequence of an angle bisector.

229
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,135
We have an altitude, the
consequence of an altitude.

230
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:41,055
We have reflexive property, so

231
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:42,553
do you have them all?

232
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:44,514
- [Isaac] Yeah.

233
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,273
- So, what could you say now?

234
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:47,000
The triangle...

235
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm going back to the black marker...

236
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:13,000
[Classroom chatter]

237
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,231
[No dialogue]

238
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:27,544
Okay, let's get him out
of the hot seat, okay?

239
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,887
Micah!

240
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:32,203
Yes, Micah.

241
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:34,601
You tell us, is he
finished with the proof?

242
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:35,831
- No.

243
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:38,223
- Why?

244
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:40,493
- Because you said no.

245
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:41,896
- Who said no?

246
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:42,884
- You.

247
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,125
- But okay, you're supposed
to tell me if there's something.

248
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,505
- Well, you have to put that...
it is the... I don't know.

249
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,656
- Frank to the rescue!

250
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,110
- He hasn't proved that
it's isosceles yet.

251
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,987
- And how do you prove
that it's isosceles?

252
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:02,344
- I don't really know.

253
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:04,913
- That sounded so tough, Frank.

254
00:12:04,913 --> 00:12:06,334
- Yes.

255
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:10,067
- Okay, you say, segment AB and segment BC

256
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,956
are congruent by C...
Wait, how do you say it?

257
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,404
- CPCTC.

258
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,218
- Corresponding Parts of
Congruent Triangles are Congruent.

259
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:20,183
- I always mess it up!

260
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:22,411
- I can't do the CPC... 
I can't do that.

261
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,204
I say the whole thing.

262
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:41,151
[Background chatter]

263
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:43,725
Okay, now, Frank, is he finished?

264
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,733
- [Student] I think.

265
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,742
- [Teacher] Is he?

266
00:12:47,742 --> 00:12:48,412
- [Student] No.
- [Student] Not yet.

267
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:49,606
- [Teacher] No, he's not.

268
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,952
Okay, why? Tell him why.

269
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,651
- Since you have the two sides congruent

270
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:56,368
and the isosceles triangle
needs two sides congruent,

271
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:59,007
then you can say that the
triangle is isosceles now

272
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,459
because AB is congruent to BC.

273
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:06,849
- So what should be his number 10?

274
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,801
- Triangle ABC is isosceles.

275
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,491
And that would be the definition
of an isosceles triangle.

276
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:16,620
Yes!

277
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,174
- [Student] I'm so proud.

278
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,531
- It keeps getting better.

279
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,349
I told you it would get better.

280
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:21,700
- [Student] Teamwork.

281
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,226
- [Student] I was stressing
last night because I was like,

282
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,929
it's so hard.

283
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:33,483
- [Isaac] Okay, you guys
understand what this means, but

284
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,012
I'm trying to hurry it.

285
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:37,452
- [Student] Good job, Isaac.

286
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:38,677
- [Student] Yeah, Isaac, a good job.

287
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,538
- Very good, Isaac!

288
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,302
One big clap for Isaac, one, two, three

289
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:51,525
(One clap from everyone)

290
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:52,514
- Alright!
- Yeah!

291
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:53,327
- You did good!

292
00:13:53,327 --> 00:13:55,196
(Laughter)

293
00:13:55,196 --> 00:14:01,139
Okay, so. You know what?

294
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:04,953
- This is the proof, that the new
program where I give you...

295
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:07,386
because I want to
make sure you get it...

296
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:11,124
enough information to do
this on our own, okay?

297
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,078
And then, I'm not going to 
write it out.

298
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,018
We're going to talk about how to do it.

299
00:14:16,018 --> 00:14:18,879
And then you're going to
complete it tonight at home.

300
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,336
So, what do we need to do?

301
00:14:21,336 --> 00:14:23,357
What is given there?

302
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,986
Jonathan. What's given?

303
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,073
- The middle one?

304
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:28,284
- [Teacher] This one, honey.

305
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:35,258
- CB is an angle bisector of ACB.

306
00:14:38,856 --> 00:14:42,405
CD is an angle bisector of ACB.

307
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,072
- [Teacher] Okay,
what does that give you?

308
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:45,651
Once you have an angle bisector?

309
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,867
No, that's not it. Don't look at that one.

310
00:14:49,867 --> 00:14:51,139
That's a totally different proof.

311
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,507
This is one that I'm
going to give you tonight.

312
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:58,561
So, what does CD being an angle
bisector of angle ACB mean?
