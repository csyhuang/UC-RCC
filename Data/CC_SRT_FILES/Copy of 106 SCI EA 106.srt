1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
- Why do they keep getting colder? Why do
they keep getting warmer?

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,250
- They add water to it.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,990
- Maybe they add water to it. Okay, what
else?

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,830
- The thermometer?

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,710
- What about the thermometer?

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,670
- They could have lights.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:25,140
- Lights, well did they turn off the
lights afterwards? Okay, at this point, at

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,100
that point?

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,920
- Maybe after they took their first
temperature they took out the thermometer.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,520
- Maybe they took out the thermometer and
that has something to do with it. The

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:51,270
thing is, ultimately are we gonna know
what they did? Unless I was video taping

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:59,450
you during that whole process. There are a
couple things I wanna point out here in a

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:11,000
second. I think several of the ideas are
possibilities. What happens if you put

14
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,740
your thermometer into the water initially.
What do you need to do? As soon as you put

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,300
it in there what do you need to do? Do you
immediately start taking readings?

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,890
- Yes.

17
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,880
- Everybody agrees? We immediately start
taking readings. As soon as we put it down

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,580
in there, like the first second we start
taking readings? We take a thermometer,

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,980
put it in hot water and immediately start
taking readings?

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,100
[Background Chatter]

21
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,660
- Like, what's the starting point and the
next temperature would be whether it

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,880
increased or decreased from that point.

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,410
- Okay, so we need a starting point. What
were you going to say?

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,820
- If you put it in there, like if you had
it at a certain temperature and you put it

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,500
in cold water it would still be reading
room temperature. It wouldn't change

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,310
immediately...

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,708
- Yes, so it goes 22, 21, 19, 18...

28
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,753
It's going down [inaudible]

29
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:14,691
- So, what could have been the issue here?

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,760
- They took it at the very beginning.

31
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,050
- Good, good. They just didn't wait long
enough. Look at this one. I saw this in

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:34,370
one particular group. Because, by the way,
you guys realize you were doing some very,

33
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:44,450
very different things, right? As we were
doing, and collecting this data there were

34
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:52,110
some major differences. What could have
happened? What was going on here? Just the

35
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,490
obvious stuff. Observation, what's the
difference in the pattern? Yes, Ma'am?

36
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,760
- The hot water is like consistent like
it's just gonna stay at the current temp.

37
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,443
- Hot water stays hot? Right? Cold water
is doing what?

38
00:03:09,443 --> 00:03:11,022
- Increasing in temperature.

39
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:15,980
- It's increasing in temperature. The room
temperature water is doing what?

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,710
- It stays the same.

41
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:31,660
- With this same group
I just happened to catch this.

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:42,050
Cold water. Luke warm water. The person
was doing this. This is the warm water.

43
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,240
- Oh *laughs* body heat.

44
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,980
- Keeping it warm.
- Insulating it.

45
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,090
- What was happening?

46
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,300
[Background Chatter]
-Transfer of heat.

47
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,980
- We're gonna be doing a lot of labs over
the next several weeks. This doesn't seem

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,320
like a big deal, right? I mean, would you
have noticed somebody just sitting there

49
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,430
going like this? You've gotta start
thinking like scientists, though. 

50
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,730
Because that could be a huge deal if we're doing
something with temperature, right? 

51
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,140
Okay, good.

52
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,710
Well, the obvious - or the observation.
What's going on with the cold water?

53
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,150
- It's increasing.

54
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,900
- It's increasing, okay. Luke warm water?

55
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,990
- Staying the same. The hot water?

56
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:49,820
- It's getting cold.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,840
- It's getting cold. Okay. What's
different from the first slide?

58
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:06,490
- Yes?
- The hot water went past the room
temperature of the cold water.

59
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,400
- Did it actually happen to somebody?

60
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:17,370
- Did it actually happen? Yeah. Let's do
this first. Let's go back to here, what

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,288
word would you use to describe what's
going on here? What's all this heading

62
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,402
towards?

63
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:24,610
- Room temperature.

64
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,680
- It's all headed towards room
temperature. There's a fancy word that

65
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,490
starts with an E.

66
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:35,020
- We may have talked about this last year.

67
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,490
- The fancy word - The idea, there's a word
I want you to walk away with.

68
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,110
The word is?

69
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,850
- [together] Equilibrium.

70
00:05:51,030 --> 00:06:00,940
- Okay, how does this show equilibrium?
Rebecca, how does this show equilibrium?

71
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,040
With the hot water, how does this show
equilibrium?

72
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,010
- Rebecca.

73
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,110
- It's Sierra. It all goes toward the
same, it's kind of like the hot is

74
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,370
increasing and it's temperature-

75
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,860
- The hot is what?

76
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,810
- I'm sorry I meant the cold. The cold is
increasing in it's temperature and then

77
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,950
it's going towards the room temperature.

78
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,670
- It's going towards room temperature. The
hot is?

79
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:41,550
- Decreasing in temperature and it's going
towards the room temperature also.-

80
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:51,080
- Is this what we would expect? All right,
so what happened? Because I don't have any

81
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,350
idea. What happened here? Yes?

82
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:02,090
- In some places of the room there are
places where there is a lot of air coming

83
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,860
out? So maybe that one cup was under a lot
of air.

84
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:15,000
- We do have some powerful air vents. What
do you guys think? Is that-- that's a huge

85
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,070
amount. Any other ideas? Yeah?

86
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,360
- I think they accidentally read one of
the cold cups and marked the temperature 

87
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,470
down for a hot cup.

88
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:36,750
- Is it possible there's human error here?
And they just... they looked at the wrong thing?

89
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,730
- Maybe when they were pouring the water
into the cups maybe they accidentally

90
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,550
mixed the cold up with the hot.

91
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:53,190
- So there's mixing the water,
thermometers--maybe just read them wrong.

92
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:05,240
So you guys think some kind of human
error, then? Yes? Yes?

93
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:12,760
- Let's go back to this and let's go to the
next step. Kind of like what we've done in

94
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,760
the past. I want you to think of this at
an atomic level, a molecular level what's

95
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:25,831
happening here. In order to do that, we're
gonna play with BBs. I've got enough sets

96
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:37,760
of BBs here, each group is gonna have a
set of BBs. All right. So group up a

97
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,200
little closer together.

98
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:41,099
Alright, so you two maybe go around... you guys.

99
00:08:51,001 --> 00:09:02,001
Here's what I want you to do. Within your group one half
have one set [Background Chatter]

100
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:12,001
Actually, the two of you can... [Backround Chatter]
Marcus...

101
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:22,771
Good, here's what I want you to do. The
BBs will be what?

102
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,629
- [together] Atoms.

103
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,102
- Atoms and molecules. Okay, are atoms and
molecules just sitting?

104
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,078
- No.

105
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:38,996
- When we add energy are they gonna go
faster or slower?

106
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,570
- [together] Faster.

107
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,500
- When we take away energy they're going
to?

108
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,700
- [together] Go slower.

109
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:55,310
- Or, rather than take away, when they
release it. I'm gonna give you a couple

110
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,540
minutes. I want you to talk within your
groups. I want you to be able to do three

111
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,990
things.

112
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,510
I'm gonna call people up here in a second.
I'm gonna stick you on the overhead so

113
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:14,750
everybody can see your BBs. I want you to
be able to simulate the top line, the

114
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:27,170
middle line and the bottom line. So,
getting cooler, room temperature, staying

115
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:36,210
the same and getting warmer. I also
want... kind of a bonus would be to use both

116
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,190
how would you show something going into
equilibrium? All right, talk to each other

117
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,300
real quick. Some are getting cooler. Some
are getting hotter. Some are staying the

118
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,798
same temperature, and how would you show
equilibrium? I'll give you about a minute

119
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:52,099
or two.

120
00:10:52,308 --> 00:13:33,300
[Background Chatter]

121
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:53,180
- All right everybody. Take a look at your
BBs. Hands off BBs. [Inaudible] I got a volunteer.

122
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,210
What were the BBs again?
- [together] Atoms.

123
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,020
- Atoms. And we're trying to show what?

124
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,336
- Movement towards equilibrium.

125
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:11,018
- Movement towards equilibrium. What?
Energy-- energy and movement how those go

126
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:24,460
together. Energy transfer is kind of a
fancy way of saying it. Okay, everyone

127
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:34,380
take a look at the chart. Here's the
graph. Show me the top line. 

128
00:14:36,517 --> 00:14:38,517
And tell me what you're doing.

129
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:46,853
- Make it faster, because it's hotter. It
decreased because it's going down and

130
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,665
getting less heat.

131
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:53,634
- Okay, so it's gonna start-- the BBs are
going to start going fast and then...

132
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,900
- Slowing down.

133
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:14,050
- Slowing down. Could you show us...
Yeah, we're in an awkward spot. 

134
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,960
Getting warmer, the bottom part of that chart.

135
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,735
- At first it goes slower and as it gets
warmer the molecules move faster because

136
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:25,082
it's getting warmer.

137
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:31,230
- Thank you. I'm gonna do room
temperature. I think room temperature

138
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:43,670
would be this, and it stays the same.
Kenny what? Well, it's gotta be moving,

139
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,541
right? Room temperature would just be this
and I have to do what?

140
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,819
[Background Chatter]

141
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:14,510
- Oh, I probably should have picked the
same group. The two of you working

142
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:21,936
together, how could you show us
equilibrium? Of going towards equilibrium.

143
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,044
- She's going to do cold.

144
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,784
- Okay, and you're going to do hot.

145
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,208
Okay good now, time out. What did you do?
Or were you not done?

146
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,600
- I started out fast and she started out
slow.

147
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,900
- Why did you start out fast?

148
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,433
- Because I was hot.
- And you were?

149
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,340
- Cold.

150
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,566
- Cold. And Lauren, what did you do?

151
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,307
- [inaudible]
- The same speed, which was getting close to equilibrium.

152
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:13,750
- Show us one more time. Good. Who
disagrees? Nobody? Good. Thank you. Here

153
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:22,720
we go, keep going. A couple more things
real fast. Most of you guys had this going

154
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,660
about six, seven, eight, nine... anywhere
from six, seven to 15 minutes of data. If

155
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,185
we did this for an hour, what would this
look like?

156
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,004
- They would eventually all be on the same
line for a while.

157
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:41,576
- And it would be pretty boring. So this
would keep going-- well, what would be the

158
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:43,620
lowest point?
- Room temperature.

159
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,815
- This would be the highest point? Then
this would still continue the same. What's

160
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:51,535
