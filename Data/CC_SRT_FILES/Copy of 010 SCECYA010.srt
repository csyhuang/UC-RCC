1
00:00:01,509 --> 00:00:04,830
[chatter]

2
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,100
- All right, so we're going to need
someone from all the groups to kind of

3
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,660
summarize for us.
- Grace?

4
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,993
- Guys, raise your hands.

5
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:44,383
[chatter]

6
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,600
- So I figured... okay, you guys
should

7
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,020
[inaudible].

8
00:02:50,200 --> 00:03:01,938
All right, I need everybody on the floor,
and you two groups sit right here, okay?

9
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:13,153
Everybody's on the floor, criss-cross
applesauce, in five. Five, four, three

10
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:19,956
two... and one.

11
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:47,797
Okay. I need you to stay where you are and
just turn around, and I'll just have the

12
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:53,300
people come talk to me, and they'll talk
to you, all right? We're going to start

13
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,340
with... let's see. We're going to start
with group one, all right? People from

14
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,390
group one, raise your hand. Okay.
Will you girls come up and tell me what

15
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,054
you guys talked about? And I'm going to
listen.

16
00:04:09,864 --> 00:04:15,320
- Our question was, select three
characteristics that you think is most

17
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:23,866
important for school and tell why. So we
had our score card, and it said stuff. So

18
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:31,157
then the first one we did was my manners,
because if you're nice, that means that

19
00:04:31,157 --> 00:04:33,502
you're polite, and then you get more
friends.

20
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,755
- All right. Next?

21
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,674
- Following directions, because you won't
have good behavior and you won't do good

22
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:46,343
on a test if you don't follow directions
and you don't do, like, your study guide,

23
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:50,662
or study, then you won't do good on a
test. And our last one is behavior in

24
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:56,652
class, is because behavior is sort of like
not listening, because then you probably

25
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:59,021
won't listen if you're just
doing, like...

26
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,358
- All right. Thank you. Now tell us,
everybody, we're doing this, and everybody

27
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:14,439
can answer. So how do you think that
relates to a job? Behavior? Yes.

28
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,222
- If you have good behavior, then you'll
get somebody to hire you, because you can

29
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:20,824
work good.

30
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:23,448
- If you have good behavior, most likely
you'll get hired, because you

31
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:23,704
[inaudible].

32
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,298
Anybody else? Nobody else? Yes, ma'am.

33
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:37,078
- Um... it's sort of like what they
said, but if you have good behavior when

34
00:05:37,078 --> 00:05:40,167
you're working your job, you won't get
fired.

35
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,570
- Okay. You won't get fired. And, you
know, good behavior is one of those things

36
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,210
such as coming to work on time, okay? If
there's nobody there to work your

37
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,390
position, then your teammates have to pick
up the work, or the work doesn't get done.

38
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:59,770
Okay, group two, let's see. Lauren, go
ahead, come up and read your question and

39
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,910
answer, please.

40
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:11,613
- What is a non-traditional career for a
male and a female? And, um...

41
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:14,980
- Go ahead.

42
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:21,133
- We wrote for a male, a fashion and a
nail designer.

43
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,432
- That's right.

44
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:26,775
- And then for a female, a pilot and a car
designer.

45
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:33,114
- Good, good. Can someone... thank you.
Can someone give me some more ideas about

46
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:37,500
some things...let's see. I'm going to
call...I'm looking at colors. I'm

47
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,217
going to pick somebody with this color on.
And you can take your jacket off, and I'm

48
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:47,720
still going to call your color, if it's
your color, red. Give me a job that you

49
00:06:47,720 --> 00:07:02,800
think might be a non-traditional career.
One for a woman. What did you... I

50
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:10,499
mean, you can use the video as an example.
You want to think about it?

51
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:11,938
- Construction worker.

52
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:14,864
- A construction worker as a woman. My
color's red. Yes, sir.

53
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:20,181
- For a woman or a male?

54
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:33,560
- It could be for a male or female. Or you
can, it doesn't even matter. Skyler.

55
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,850
- For a girl, maybe a football coach.

56
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,236
- For a female, definitely a football
coach. If you guys watch Glee,  you see

57
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:47,763
the football coach is a male, a female.
And so, yeah. But now, Sakwan, we're going

58
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:50,387
to go with you last, and then I'm going to
go to group three.

59
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:58,770
- Um... for a male, probably a teacher?

60
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,341
- A male as a teacher. Exactly. So let's
have Grace... not Grace.

61
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,827
- Alex.
- Alex.

62
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,850
- Mallory. Mallory, do you have a V under
your name?

63
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,170
- Yes.

64
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:17,090
- You're from group three? So let's, let
me read yours, and you guys answer. You

65
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,940
can stay there. Let me read it, and you
guys answer. So group three was, using

66
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,390
what you have learned about
non-traditional careers, what would you

67
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:33,170
say to someone when they say that a boy
can't do a job, or a girl can't? And I

68
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,300
will just let you guys read.

69
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:48,490
- I would say that it doesn't matter if
you're a male or a female, as long as you

70
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,786
like your job and you can do your job
well. Nobody can tell you that you can't

71
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:55,178
do something just because you're a boy or
a girl.

72
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:04,164
- Good. Does anybody disagree with that
one? No? Does anybody agree with that

73
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:08,874
statement? Okay. All right. Sakwan, come
up, do, you guys are going to do number

74
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:13,634
four, and we're going to move to the next
activity.

75
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,280
- Our question is, what plans do we have
for being successful in schoolwork? We

76
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,320
wrote, do your homework, follow
directions, paying attention, being

77
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,264
respectful, good grades and not shouting
loud. And the

78
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:41,659
[inaudible]

79
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:49,159
oh yeah. And don't have some, like,
yelling or, like, stealing things, like...

80
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,224
- Report cards.
- Yeah, but, no.

81
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:52,526
- [inaudible]

82
00:09:55,126 --> 00:09:58,460
- Yes.
- Well, we did a couple, like,

83
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,329
[inaudible].

84
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:05,940
Writing is a little challenging. Reading,
easy, some books.

85
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,270
- Okay. So they went with the idea of, you
know, not too easy, not too hard. Good.

86
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:17,540
Thank you. Now what we're going to do now
is we're going to do some research on

87
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,730
non-traditional careers. Now, some of you
will be where the purple papers are. Some

88
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,790
of you will be where the white ones are.
And it's just so that you guys will be

89
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,140
able to talk about this later and say,
okay, this is what I experienced on a

90
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,010
policy job, and this is what I experienced
on the other one. So everybody point your

91
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,310
attention to the front, and I'm going to
go through one of the worksheets with you.

92
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,690
I'm going to go through the harder
worksheet with you, okay? Just point your

93
00:10:45,870 --> 00:11:02,080
attention to the front.
And I'm going to go through this one with

94
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,970
you, because this one is the hardest one,
and then all the other ones are the easier

95
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:13,010
ones. Okay, the worksheet that we're going
to do today is going to tie in what you

96
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:19,640
guys talked about with careers, subjects.
When do you all get report cards?

97
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,140
- We got it yesterday.

98
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,960
- You got them yesterday. What I want you
to do is I want you to think about your

99
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,940
report card, your favorite subject,
whether it be English, math, science,

100
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,610
social studies, whether it be PE, art,
whatever it is, and I want you to pick

101
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:44,720
from this site. You see this site? It says
www.bls.gov/k12/, okay? I want you to pick

102
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:53,210
from that site your, what subject you did
the best in, or what your best interest

103
00:11:53,390 --> 00:12:01,390
is. There are some of you, I know somebody
here likes nature. They will pick nature,

104
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,270
and in that job, if it's a boy, he's going
to pick a job that he thinks mostly

105
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,830
females have.
Who thinks they can give me an idea of

106
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,308
what job mostly females have? Molly?

107
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,560
- Maybe a veterinarian.

108
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,130
- A veterinarian. Most veterinarians I've
seen have been female. So I would go

109
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,520
there. And if I was a boy, I would read
through this sheet. On this sheet, it has

110
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,230
some questions. It says how to get ready.
You'll find that tab, and you'll give me a

111
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:37,360
summary of how they get ready for this
job. It says what is this job like. You

112
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,610
read that, and you'll give me a one or two
sentence summary of what the job is like.

113
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,890
And it says, are there other jobs like
this? That's to the bottom. And you can

114
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:57,434
write those jobs down. Another one says,
what about the future? And you'll write a

115
00:12:57,434 --> 00:13:03,160
one or two minute summary of that section.
Also, we have some reflection questions at

116
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,970
the bottom of this worksheet, and the
reflection question is, one is, what did I

117
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,620
learn about careers? The other one is
what's a non-traditional career, and the

118
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,920
last one is what did I learn about myself?
So make sure you answer all those

119
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:25,760
questions in the worksheet. Now, if I was
a girl and I went to nature, what job do

120
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:37,640
you think I would pick Alea?
What job do you think most boys have

121
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,095
that's over here for nature?

122
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:41,810
- Zookeeper?

123
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:49,150
- Maybe a zookeeper. So the object of this
is to do research in the area that you

124
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,660
find most interesting. Is this what I have
to be when I grow up, Mr. Nealy? No. You

125
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,700
just have to do research in that area. So
the big important part is to have research

126
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,180
done in that area, just so that you can
explore different jobs.

127
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,030
And I think, was it group three that had
that question?

128
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,480
- Yeah.

129
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,490
- Group four that had the question about
what would you tell somebody? Who had that

130
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,210
question?
- Us.

131
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,810
- Group three had that question, and I
think you guys gave a pretty convincing

132
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,250
argument. Okay, I'm going to tell you
who's going to sit at the purple stations.

133
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:26,020
If you're sitting at a purple station,
you're going to click yes, you want sound.

134
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,610
And your worksheet is already there. And I
want us to compare and contrast the

135
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,580
different information you get from the two
worksheets. Okay, purple station. Skyler,

136
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,000
go to a purple station. Mr. Y-...
