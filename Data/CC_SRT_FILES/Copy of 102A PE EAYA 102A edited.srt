1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,457
- [Teacher] Good, right?

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:05,549
So I was telling you that
these are the piece of bread

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:06,713
and these were a piece of bread

4
00:00:06,713 --> 00:00:08,267
and I could have a

5
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,663
peanut butter and jelly sandwich

6
00:00:10,663 --> 00:00:12,614
on white bread,

7
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:15,818
or I can have a peanut butter
and jelly on wheat bread.

8
00:00:15,818 --> 00:00:18,744
We're going to keep the
white bread for right now.

9
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:19,882
Pop push.

10
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,761
Then this made me laugh.

11
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:26,499
Think about this as the heel of the bread.

12
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,239
- [Student 1] I don't get it.

13
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:30,559
(Teacher laughing)

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,690
- [Teacher] I'm glad to know that
you're like "I don't get it."

15
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:35,435
There's a piece of bread and
there's a heel of the bread--

16
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,315
- [Students] Oh!

17
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:38,332
(Teacher laughing)

18
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:40,271
- [Student 2] The butt of the bread?

19
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:40,874
- Yeah!

20
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,826
Oh, that's why!

21
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,498
Because you call it the
"butt of the bread".

22
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,002
Oh!

23
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:48,387
But it's the heel of the bread.

24
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:49,819
Ok so not so funny.

25
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:51,137
(Students laughing)

26
00:00:51,607 --> 00:00:54,295
- [Teacher] So we have pop push, step

27
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:57,543
as our ingredient and then as our

28
00:00:57,543 --> 00:01:00,765
butt of the bread, good
flap step dig, right?

29
00:01:01,908 --> 00:01:03,710
So today we're going to do

30
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:05,730
pop push, step, good flap, step dig

31
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,143
as a review on the right and on the left.

32
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:12,278
And then we're going to do pop push, flap,

33
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,391
we're going to add another ingredient,

34
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:15,970
flap step dig. Okay?

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,943
Flap step dig.

36
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:22,703
Now remember--this--
is important, why?

37
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:24,096
- [Students] It's the ingredient.

38
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,472
- [Teeacher] barely
comes up, think about it.

39
00:01:27,849 --> 00:01:30,728
- [Student 3] Good flap
because when you step flap

40
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:32,885
means that it's two sounds to (mumbles).

41
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,818
- [Teacher] Boo ya!

42
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:35,996
Remember it's two sounds

43
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,016
and that's why you say "Good flap"

44
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,222
and to get it up, she said, real high.

45
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:43,653
Alright, everybody up,
(claps her hands) spread out.

46
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,859
Pop push.

47
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,373
Pop push again is spank, kick.

48
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:55,067
It's exactly what we did as warm up

49
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:57,245
the one across the board.

50
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,558
Put your right heel out.

51
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:02,193
I need a good pop push.

52
00:02:02,193 --> 00:02:04,368
Ready and (shoes tapping).

53
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:07,794
I need a good step. (shoes tapping)

54
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,420
As we step, what do we do?

55
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,697
What happens to the body?

56
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,206
- [Students] We swing right.

57
00:02:12,206 --> 00:02:13,962
- [Teacher] We sure did, pick up that foot.

58
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:16,214
Good flap, (shoes tapping)

59
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,443
step dig. (shoes tapping)

60
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,324
Alright, do it one more time.

61
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,553
Let's do an echo.

62
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:23,528
Let me do it.

63
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:26,082
I'll do pop push, step, you do

64
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:27,893
- [Students] Pop push, step.

65
00:02:27,893 --> 00:02:30,330
- [Teacher] I do good flap, step dig.

66
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,274
You do--

67
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:32,713
- [Students] Good flap, step dig.

68
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,564
- [Teacher] Right, right.

69
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:35,119
And I go.

70
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,536
(Teacher's shoes tapping)

71
00:02:36,536 --> 00:02:38,742
(Students' shoes tapping)

72
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,135
Okay, I go.

73
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,714
(Teacher's shoes tapping)

74
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:43,144
(Students' shoes tapping)

75
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,189
-[Teacher] Better.

76
00:02:44,189 --> 00:03:16,603
(teacher' shoes tapping
and then the students')

77
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,791
- [Teacher] Ok by now our muscle
memory is either going

78
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,695
"I got it! I've worked it out"

79
00:03:20,695 --> 00:03:21,926
or "I don't got it"

80
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:24,384
and we need to correct it
before it becomes muscle memory.

81
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:25,816
So here's what I want you to do.

82
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,023
Say "Pop push step".

83
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:28,230
- [Students] Pop push step.

84
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,368

95
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:43,398
Six, (hands clapping) here you go.

96
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,048
You take--

97
00:03:44,048 --> 00:03:46,208

00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,413

100
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:51,563
Good flap step dig.

101
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:52,677
- [Teacher] You can do a shuffle.

102
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,744
Pop push step

103
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:55,887
Good flap step dig.

104
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:56,746
You want to? Okay.

105
00:03:56,746 --> 00:04:17,045
(shoes tapping)

106
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:17,886
- [Teacher] Not too bad!

107
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:20,812
Look at y'all keep on going
just like wonderful kids!

108
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:21,950
Now let me take a dip.

109
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,863
What I need you to do real quick:

110
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:26,093
bunch up right here.

111
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:27,342
Bunch up.

112
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,823
Do me a favor and...

113
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,327
bunch up right there.

114
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:33,263
Do you body roll?

115
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:34,104
- [Student] Not really.

116
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:35,088
- [Teacher] Yeah you do. (laughs)

117
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,264
- [Student] No.

118
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,495
- [Teacher] Sure you do.

119
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:40,382
Ok well I got it wrong.

120
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:41,991
You don't body roll but you will.

121
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,939
You rock, you rock, knee right.

122
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,213
(Background Chatter)

123
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,531
No? (Giggles)

124
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:50,862
Come on, right hand.

125
00:04:50,862 --> 00:04:52,743
Flap, step, dig.

126
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:54,438
See you're doing this
really well. (Giggles)

127
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,459
Alright point your leg, listen.

128
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,879
We're going flap, step, dig.

129
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,429
(Background Chatter)

130
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,859
Flap, step, dig.

131
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,929
Ready?

132
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:23,503
And right foot, step, flap step dig.

133
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:24,664
Yes!

134
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,661
(Background Chatter)

135
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,445
- [Teacher] How is this group doing?

136
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:30,623
Okay everybody look, everybody look!

137
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:31,994
Here we go.

138
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:34,961
Five, six oh you precious thing.

139
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,081
Are you ready?

140
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:37,799
Deep breaths.

141
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:39,517
You need your right foot out.

142
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:43,183
Six, ready, and pop push step.

143
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,893
Good flap step dig.

144
00:05:44,893 --> 00:05:46,239
Almost, left foot.

145
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,933
Pop push step

146
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,069

147
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,833
Okay, let me tell you why.

148
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,647
You're doing a shuffle.

149
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:58,496
We do pop push, step, lift your foot up,

150
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:01,004
good flap step dig, on left foot.

151
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:03,633
Pop push step.

152
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:06,057
Good flap, step dig.

153
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:07,752
These were all two things.

154
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:10,158
Okay, body roll.

155
00:06:10,158 --> 00:06:11,441
Do a body roll.

156
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,523
Now you can't do a body
roll back here. (Laughs)

157
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:18,299
Hold my hand.

158
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:20,650
Here we go.

159
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,276
Pop push.

160
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:26,687
Step. Shift it over.

161
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,243
Good, flap step dig, right here.

162
00:06:28,243 --> 00:06:30,722
Good flap step dig.

163
00:06:31,076 --> 00:06:32,660
Did you get all this?

164
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,488
Again the right foot.

165
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:34,742
Flex your toes.

166
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,073
Good flap step dig.

167
00:06:38,295 --> 00:06:40,315
Good flap step dig.

168
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:41,946
(Background Chatter) bring it in.

169
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:44,218
Oh, no you gotta body roll!

Good flap step dig.

172
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:48,166
That's better.

173
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,115
And since the problem is
your weight distribution

174
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:54,063
it's back here and it's
hard to do it like this.

175
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:57,105
So you gotta do like this.

176
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:58,605
Yeah? Okay.

177
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,759

204
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:54,447

(Students laughing)

288
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,380
Be careful you might slip.

289
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,338
That's a hazard, always safety first.

290
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:52,163
Yes?

291
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:53,670
Okay, Andra?

292
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,016

00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,593
(Laughing)

298
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:02,940
- [Teacher] Do you find--okay.

299
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,171
- [Student 4] I do mines in the kitchen.

300
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:05,471
- You do yours in the kitchen.

301
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:06,396
Does your mom yell at you?

302
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:07,426
[Student] No.

303
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:08,686
-[Teacher] Be careful.

304
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:10,456
- [Jasline] Like when you
sit down on the desk in class

305
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:11,805
and you just sit there, all year.

306
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,825
- [Teacher] Okay so Jasline, do your
teachers get on to you

307
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:15,116
when you practice in class?

308
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,246
- [Jasline] No cause I'm quiet.

309
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:16,655
- [Teacher] Because you're quiet.

310
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:17,467
(Students Laughing)

311
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:19,511
- [Teacher] Well number one, I'm super proud of you

312
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:20,881
for practicing everywhere.

313
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,667
And do you find that
you do it all the time?

314
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:25,710
In the store, in the school.

315
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,404
So it's not just something that
you're going to do in class.

316
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,402
You see this?

317
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,855
And what you're going to find is odd

318
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:34,409
a lot of former students
come back and they go:

319
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,754
"Oh, well I continue to do this

320
00:11:36,754 --> 00:11:38,403
"and I'm not even taking tapping.

321
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:41,049
"I wish I could go find and tap more."

322
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:42,133
Okay when that's gonna happen,

323
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:43,665
because it is going to happen to you,

324
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,987
it's like a bug, it's like a virus,

325
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,709
you just get all excited and all that.

326
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,413
Go to Youtube for me,

327
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:53,176
and on Youtube, there are
lots of how-to videos.

328
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,220
Do you know you could look up

329
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,144
how to do this time-step
on the Youtube video?

330
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:00,675
Now is it going to be your standard

331
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,649
buck and wing arc, buck times step?

332
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,322
- [Students] No.

333
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,366
- [Teacher] No, it may not be because
remember the sandwiches

334
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:06,968
it may be a different kind of sandwich,

335
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:09,882
a different kind of time-step.

336
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,073
So, if you're ever curious
and you want to continue

337
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:16,302
this through like, because you're gonna.

338
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,274
Do you have to have tap shoes by the way?

339
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,337
- [Students] No.

340
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,558
- [Teacher] No.

341
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,082
What do you have to have?

342
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,104
- [Students] Hard floor.

343
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,821
- [Teacher] Tammy, sit up for me.

344
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:25,981
You what?

345
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:27,351
- [Student] A shoe with a hard bottom.

346
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:29,650
- [Teacher] Yeah. Look, I'm in heels right?

347
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,690
That's all you have to do.

348
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,329
Now one of the things that
I wanted to point out to you

349
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:37,837
as we're about to evaluate yourselves

350
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:39,044
and evaluate your peers,

351
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,041
I want you to look at weight distribution.

352
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,318
Say "weight distribution".

353
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,804
- [Students] Weight distribution.

354
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,934
- [Teacher] What is weight distribution?

355
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:48,425
- [Jasline] Can I use an example?

356
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,090
- [Teacher] Yes.

357
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:49,950
- [Jasline] Like when we're doing

358
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,102
the good flap ball change,

359
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,401
you have to move your
body up for the good flap

360
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:57,804
and you move it back
down for the step-beat.

361
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,126
- [Teacher] Okay, so great, Jasline said

362
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,678
that you have to move your
body forward on the good flap

363
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:07,693
and then back, and sit it
back down, for the step dig.

364
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:09,646
Anybody had something to add?

365
00:13:09,646 --> 00:13:11,416
- [Student] Shift your weight.

366
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:15,503
- [Teacher] Yes, you're right you
shift your weight which way?

367
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,515
- [Student] Opposite of
which way you switch your knee.

368
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:21,231
- [Teacher] Oh, opposite of which
way of whatever foot I'm using

369
00:13:21,231 --> 00:13:23,382
because if I have this foot up

370
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,186
I've got...

371
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,458
(show tapping)

372
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:28,421
right?

373
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,813
Does my body have to turn?

374
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:31,973
- [Students] No.

375
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,093
- [Teacher] No, but it kind of does, don't it?

376
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,905
Got some hip action going on right here.

377
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,298
(Students laughing)

378
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:39,264
Alright anybody else see
any weight distribution?

379
00:13:39,873 --> 00:13:41,575
(shoes tapping)

380
00:13:44,889 --> 00:13:48,232
- [Student] We can do the sink,

381
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:50,301
you're kind of down a little bit.

382
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,001
- [Teacher] Okay, I was going to say,
I was trying to get to you.

383
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:56,220
The weight distribution
doesn't necessarily

384
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,048
have to go right to left, right?

385
00:13:59,052 --> 00:14:00,871
Or front to back.

386
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,416
It can go, up and down.

387
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,643
What is the reason we want
out weight distribution

388
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,541
kind of lowered?

389
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:10,814
- [Student] So we can move.

390
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:11,534
- [Teacher] Move.

391
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:12,974
- [Student] To have (Background Chatter)

392
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:15,110
- [Teacher] to have a better base for what?

393
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,772
- [Students] (Background Chatter)

394
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,514
- [Teacher] Okay so we can keep the rhythm.

395
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:23,018
Because if the rate of speed, speeds up

396
00:14:23,018 --> 00:14:26,960
then our rhythm has to
stay with it, right?

397
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:32,515
Tell me how different, how
important is weight distribution

398
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:37,515
as opposed to females and males?

399
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:40,282
Anybody know the difference?

400
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,232
We covered this one.

401
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:45,149
Where's the woman's center of gravity?

402
00:14:46,196 --> 00:14:47,055
- [Student] In her glut.

403
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:48,490
(Students laughing)

404
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,164
- [Teacher] You are absolutely correct.

405
00:14:52,164 --> 00:14:54,485
In her glut, right through here

406
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,665
and that's where women
tend to put on weight

407
00:14:56,665 --> 00:14:59,289
right gravity centers,
her center of gravity

408
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,821
around her belly, the baby belly

409
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:02,400
and around...

410
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,396
- [Studnet 10] Idk.

411
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:08,200
- [Teacher] Oh Idk, alright you don't know?

412
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,690
So where is the men's center of gravity?

413
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,635
Where do they tend to...

414
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:13,935
- [Students] Torso.

415
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:14,980
- [Teacher] Torso.

416
00:15:15,705 --> 00:15:17,359
Right, their diaphragm

417
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:20,685
and that's where we get
that spare tire from.

418
00:15:21,435 --> 00:15:23,095
A man's center of gravity,

419
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:25,333
and this is what it means,

420
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:28,250
are we here?

421
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,727
There we are.

422
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:31,265
Here's what it means.

423
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,658
As the woman's center of gravity

424
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:35,088
if your body can be forward

425
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:37,456
and your bottom is still back

426
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:39,371
and you're fine and dandy.

427
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,691
A man, if this is him, he's going forward.

428
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,736
He's going to fall.

429
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,962
He's not going to be
able to keep his weight.

430
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:50,191
So it makes a difference
in your body posture

431
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:51,886
and your weight distribution.

432
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:52,652
Yes?

433
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,375
Let's look really quickly...

434
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,828
Oh, how many of you have
taught your significant adult?

435
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:01,993
You taught a significant adult

436
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,595
and you taught the time-step.

437
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,986
What did you see, anybody?

438
00:16:05,986 --> 00:16:08,053
- [Student] Sometimes
your parents got the rhythm

439
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:09,585
(Background Chatter) has lost.

440
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,837
If your parents are a little older

441
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,049
than most average parents,
let's say like 40s to 50s.

442
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,512
- [Teacher] Good, good.

443
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:17,881
- [Jasline] Their
rhythm has kind lost it.

444
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:20,597
It takes a longer time to teach them.

445
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,849
They have to be concentrated
because they're like

446
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,939
"Uh uh do that again, do that again!".

447
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:27,191
- [Teacher] Okay, Jasline, that is awesome

448
00:16:27,191 --> 00:16:28,631
I'm going to put you on hold for a minute

449
00:16:28,631 --> 00:16:30,280
because I have heard
from you several times.

450
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,532
Let me hear from somebody new.

451
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:33,414
Come on, Audrey.

452
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:36,514
- [Audrey] I found that I really
got my skills from my mom.

453
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:37,914
My fast-learning skills.

454
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,829
- [Teacher] You got your fast learning
skills from your mom, awesome!

455
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,524
- [Audrey] She learned real fast.

456
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:44,071
- [Teacher] She picked it up good.

457
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,393
Alright who else?

458
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,970
- [Student] Instead of
teaching a significant adult

459
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,144
I taught my whole family to tap.

460
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,048
- [Teacher] You taught your whole family?

461
00:16:53,048 --> 00:16:53,651
Rock on!

462
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:56,043
- [Student] I found out
that my youngest brother

463
00:16:56,043 --> 00:16:58,985
learned faster than even my mother.

464
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,306
- [Teacher] So why do you think
your youngest brother

465
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:02,419
learned faster than your mom?

466
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,810
- [Student 12] I think she
slowed down over the years.

467
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,366
- [Teacher] Over the years, okay.

468
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,479
Okay let me hear from somebody up here

469
00:17:08,479 --> 00:17:12,614
because I haven't heard
anything from up here.

470
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:17,317
- [Student] While I was teaching my
mama, my daddy got excited

471
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:19,523
and he wanted to, 
so I taught both of them

472
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,313
and they decided upon themselves

473
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:24,298
who was going to learn
it the quickest and--

474
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,105
- [Teacher] Right, competition--

475
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:30,430
- [Student] And my mama, she
actually learned it faster

476
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,891
but although it took my daddy more time,

477
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:35,236
once he got it, he could
do it over and over again.

478
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:38,803
He actually got pretty
good, like speed-wise.

479
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:39,824
- [Teacher] See?

480
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,889
Tap is for all ages guys.

481
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:44,631
It'll keep you in good health,

482
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,579
it's something fun, it'll keep you active.

483
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:50,528
You don't have to learn a certain...

484
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,038
you know we learned a step

485
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:53,686
and I hate to teach a step

486
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,358
but that's the beautiful
thing about tapping,

487
00:17:55,358 --> 00:17:58,141
it's you can come up
with all kinds of stuff.

488
00:17:58,421 --> 00:18:00,629
And you know-- Hey, look here, 
I want you to hear.

489
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,693
How many of you like step, step dancing?

490
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:06,155
Oh, all around the room.

491
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,727
Oh, we love the step dancing right?

492
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:12,563
Step and tap are similar,
do you see the correlations?

493
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,698
You're making rhythms, there
are prescribed movements.

494
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,322
So we need to

495
00:18:20,322 --> 00:18:24,037
really think about the
ways that they intersect

496
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:27,195
