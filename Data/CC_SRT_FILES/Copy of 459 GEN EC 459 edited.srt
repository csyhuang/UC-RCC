1
00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:02,153
- And I'm going to look
at what number that is

2
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:05,642
and I see that that is
20 inches, okay?

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,399
Now, your information that you get,

4
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,716
we're going to be writing
in our chart here.

5
00:00:13,937 --> 00:00:15,969
So do you see at the
bottom of your page,

6
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:18,407
it has ramp with one book,

7
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:19,777
you're going to write
the distance that

8
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:20,973
your car moved.

9
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:22,598
Now don't write 20 inches,
'cause yours is

10
00:00:22,598 --> 00:00:24,358
going to be different, okay?

11
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:28,485
You write how far your car
went for ramp number one.

12
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:29,519
Okay?

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,889
Hold on just a second Isabelle.

14
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:33,292
Now, I gave you guys numbers.

15
00:00:33,292 --> 00:00:34,720
And the numbers are
so that we all get

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,478
a chance to do every
part of this experiment.

17
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:40,949
The number one person is
going to set up the ramp.

18
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,986
So they're going to
put the dictionary

19
00:00:42,986 --> 00:00:45,419
and the ramp, get it all
set up for the group.

20
00:00:45,866 --> 00:00:47,386
The number two person
is going to get

21
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:50,992
to hold the car, and let it go, okay?

22
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:53,133
And then the number three person,

23
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,699
is going to measure the distance

24
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:57,900
that it went, okay?

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,215
Close attention (mumbles).

26
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:02,955
Okay, so you're going
to all have a job to do.

27
00:01:02,955 --> 00:01:05,736
Now this is with the one dictionary.

28
00:01:05,788 --> 00:01:07,321
When we do the experiment next, we're

29
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,958
going to try it with two dictionaries

30
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,094
and see how it changes, okay?

31
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:14,159
But for right now, we're going
to try just one dictionary.

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,836
Are there any questions
before we get started?

33
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:18,577
Miguel.

34
00:01:25,057 --> 00:01:26,939
- Like, the first one goes first,

35
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,412
and then on the second thing,

36
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:32,210
like you try to set
the number one does

37
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,882
the second job,

38
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:38,050
and the second person
does the number three

39
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,738
and the number three
does the number one job?

40
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:42,961
- Yes, so everyone is
going to get a chance to do

41
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,904
every single part of
the experiment, okay?

42
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:48,499
So we don't need to fight
over who gets to do the car,

43
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:50,124
and who can get that, okay?

44
00:01:50,124 --> 00:01:51,366
Isabelle, question?

45
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:53,862
- But what if we do the same,

46
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,655
each of us what we do?

47
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,574
- Oh, if that's what you
get, if you get 20 inches

48
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:02,318
on yours, then you write
that down, okay?

49
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,408
Yes.

50
00:02:03,408 --> 00:02:04,068
Angie.

51
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:08,165
- When you took... 

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,116
- No, we're all going
to talk to each other

53
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,909
in nice, friendly voices,
that's right.

54
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:17,354
Okay, Max, last question, and then

55
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:18,329
we need to get started.

56
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,268
- Are we going to use the rulers?

57
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,325
- Yes, you're going to use the rulers.

58
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,194
And I know I didn't give
those to the groups,

59
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,545
but I'm going to pass
those out right now, okay?

60
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,277
Can I have you guys
please quietly walk

61
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:31,739
with your papers and your
pencil to your group?

62
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:39,298
[Background Chatter]

63
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,031
- Who's going to set up the ramp?

64
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:42,977
- Me.

65
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,957
[Background Chatter]

66
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,562
- Okay, you're number two.

67
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:58,990
[Background Chatter]

68
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,210
- Start it in the corner?

69
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:06,891
[Background Chatter]

70
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,145
- It's a meter.

71
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:20,857
[Background Chatter]

72
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,942
- Come on over here.

73
00:03:23,888 --> 00:03:25,264
Okay, get your paper.

74
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,201
- No, but watch out!

75
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:30,570
- Don't do it!

76
00:03:32,897 --> 00:03:34,023
- Awesome!

77
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:35,991
[Background Chatter]

78
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,550
- Okay boys and girls, once you get

79
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,122
to your group, you can
go ahead and get started.

80
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:48,970
- It looks farther.

81
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,021
- And this group, you may use

82
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,200
this ruler.

83
00:03:58,262 --> 00:03:59,440
- Okay, measure it.

84
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,912
One right here, and then here.

85
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:05,529
- Are you okay?

86
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,242
[Background Chatter]

87
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,076
- No, from here.

88
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,487
- From there, there.

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,728
No, Ms. Sprano said from here.

90
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:20,705
Nine inches.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,439
No, 11,11, 11 inches.

92
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,658
- It looks like eight.

93
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:26,585
Wait is, oh no it's eight.

94
00:04:26,995 --> 00:04:28,671
Remember what Ms. Sprano said?

95
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,022
- No, she said from the front.

96
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,219
- Actually, I said from the back.

97
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,357
Good listening Miguel.

98
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,797
So how far did the car go?

99
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:35,667
- Eight inches.

100
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,163
- Eight inches, okay, excellent.

101
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:40,120
So write down your information.

102
00:04:40,869 --> 00:04:42,187
You've got a pencil right here.

103
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:46,546
Okay so the next step,
Isabelle, Miguel and Angie.

104
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:48,862
Is you're going to try
it with two dictionaries.

105
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:50,058
Okay?

106
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:52,830
- But number three is
going to set it up?

107
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:55,835
- Look up at the chart to
see who's going to set it up.

108
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,053
- So, who's setting it up?

109
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:03,938
- Um, number two.

110
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,738
[Background Chatter]

111
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,449
- Okay, let's figure it out.

112
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:16,454
Okay, now go to your
group for a second.

113
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:19,020
Okay now, is this how far going to?

114
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,657
- Yea, 'till we go.

115
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,241
- Well wait a second,
are we measuring

116
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,646
from the top of the ramp, or are we

117
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,185
measuring from the bottom?

118
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:28,453
So, you're going to put the ruler

119
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,665
right up next to the edge of the ramp,

120
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,284
and then measure to the end of the car.

121
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:33,654
So how far did that car go?

122
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:34,989
- Five.

123
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,382
- No, it's to the end of the car.

124
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:37,694
So how far did the car go?

125
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:38,298
- Two.

126
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,296
- Two inches.

127
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:41,630
Now, do you guys think that

128
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,604
because you're on a thicker carpet,

129
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,909
that's going to change your results?

130
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:49,578
- It should go up like that.

131
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:52,166
- Do you think that the thicker carpet

132
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,831
is going to slow the car down and make it

133
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,298
not go so far?

134
00:05:55,298 --> 00:05:56,118
- Yes.

135
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:56,855
- Yeah?

136
00:05:57,064 --> 00:06:00,051
Would you guys like to move
to that part of the carpet?

137
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:02,365
- Yeah.
- Okay, you can move to that carpet,

138
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:04,438
and see what the difference is.

139
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:07,675
And you guys will have to share
that with the class, okay?

140
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:13,187
So try it again with just
one dictionary, okay?

141
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:14,711
- So then one.

142
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:32,510
[Background Chatter]

143
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,114
- Have to let the car go guys!

144
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:43,977
[Background Chatter]

145
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,411
- We're going to try
it with two dictionaries.

146
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,062
- Okay, so look at the chart to see

147
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,451
who's going to set it up next.

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,680
- Oh my God, this
is going to be loud.

149
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:56,619
- We're good Ms. Sprano!

150
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:59,254
- She said from the very back!

151
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,660
- You set it up.

152
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:07,967
No, I mean, you let go.

153
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:13,575
- Who's turn is it?

154
00:07:14,277 --> 00:07:15,229
You're doing the first one.

155
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:16,709
Who's number three?

156
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,594
We all have jobs to do.

157
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:20,680
Who's number one?

158
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:23,565
Okay, so your job is to
set up the ramp,

159
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,045
which you did a good job on.

160
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:27,483
Number two person, who's
the number two person?

161
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,923
So Giselle.

162
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,735
- I'm number three.

163
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:32,279
- No, she was two.

164
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,062
- It's fine, she's number three.

165
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,784
So Giselle, you're
going to let the car go,

166
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,920
and look, Esmeralda is going to measure.

167
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,279
Okay, so...

168
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,363
[Background Chatter]

169
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:48,824
Excellent.

170
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,711
Okay, now put that down.

171
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,112
Now which side do we
need to start with?

172
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:58,420
Very good.

173
00:07:58,836 --> 00:08:00,723
And then we can spin
it around there.

174
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,074
So now you want to move it over

175
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:05,501
so that you can measure
at the end of the carpet.

176
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,923
Can you scoot it over some?

177
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,058
Very good, so how far
did the car go?

178
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,400
Seven inches, good.

179
00:08:12,776 --> 00:08:15,105
Okay, so let's write
that down on our chart.

180
00:08:16,677 --> 00:08:17,903
Finish yours.

181
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:21,806
Change this so it's seven inches.

182
00:08:22,694 --> 00:08:24,795
Okay, now what's our next step,

183
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,293
what are we going to do next?

184
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:27,611
- I don't know.

185
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,813
- Are we going to try it
with two dictionaries?

186
00:08:33,398 --> 00:08:37,224
Okay, so now, who's going to set that up?

187
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,540
Looks like the number two person,

188
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,978
so Giselle is going to
go ahead and set up

189
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:44,759
the dictionary, so put one
more dictionary on top.

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,428
Okay, good.

191
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,286
Well, number three is
going to let the car go.

192
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:55,007
So now it's Esmeralda's turn.

193
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:57,391
So you guys, what do you
think is going to happen?

194
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:59,666
Do you think it's
going to go farther,

195
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,913
or do you think
it's going to be closer?

196
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:04,229
When you let go of
the car right now,

197
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:05,745
what do you think
is going to happen?

198
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:09,941
You think it'll fall down?

199
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:11,619
Okay, well let's see what happens.

200
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:19,845
Woah, did you see how far that went?

201
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:21,122
Okay, don't pick it.

202
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:23,548
Now, wait a second, it's
Edgar's turn to measure.

203
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:25,470
So let's see, how far did it go Edgar?

204
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,353
So we measure to the, 14.

205
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:31,275
Wow, that went farther, didn't it?

206
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,428
So your next step is going to be

207
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,246
to do it with three dictionaries.

208
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:38,578
Please go sit down in your
group and raise your hand.

209
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:42,990
Let's go sit down at our group.

210

211
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:59,035
- The car's there.

212
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:00,904
- 15 and a half!

213
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,558

15 and a half.

Who knows how to write 15 and a half?

218

[Background Chatter]

219
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,886
- So number two would get to

220
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:29,277
measure the distance on this one, okay?

221
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:31,060
[Background Chatter]

222
00:10:33,492 --> 00:10:35,344
Okay, so let me see
how you're doing here.

223
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,977
Okay, well can we try it again?

224
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:45,555
Can we try it again?

225
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,836
So, you're on the second experiment.

226
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:50,007
So number three, who's
the number three person?

227
00:10:50,007 --> 00:10:51,005
- He is.

228
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,013
- Jose's the number three person?

229
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,536
Okay, so Jose get's to let it go.

230
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,008
Should we move this out of the way,

231
00:10:55,008 --> 00:10:56,697
or should we keep it here?

232
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,194
So, are you number three?

233
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,719
- No, I'm number one,
but number one

234
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:09,666
set it up.

235
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,309
But then see.

236
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,047
Oh.

237
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:21,368
- Okay so, it looks like it's
Jose's turn to let the car go.

238
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:22,367
So hand the car--

239
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,828
- No, he sets up ramp.

240
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:26,360
- Can you go sit down please,
and I'll be

241
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,138
right with you.

242
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:28,171
- Got it.

243
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,493
- Okay Jose, try it.

244
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,058
It's my car, put it right here
and let's see what happens.

245
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,505
Okay, let go.

246
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,726
Excellent, okay who's measuring?

247
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:42,225
- Me.

00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:43,827
- Okay, so let's measure.

249
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,627
Now do we want it,
are we measuring with

250
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:47,212
inches or centimeters?

251
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:51,502
No, it's right, we're
doing it the right way.

252
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,198

15 inches.

255
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,448
Did it go farther,
or was it closer?

[Background Chatter]

257
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:13,166
Okay, so then I have a
question for you guys, listen.

258
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:16,329
If we put three dictionaries here,

259
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:17,990
do you think it's going to go farther,

260
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,655
or it's going to go closer?

261
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,167
- Farther.

262
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,027
- You think it's going to be farther?

263
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:22,327
What do you think Jose?

264
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,023
- Farther.

265
00:12:23,023 --> 00:12:24,000
- What do you think?

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,662
- Farther.

267
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,032
- Well okay, we better check it out.

268
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,721
Did you write down your numbers?

269
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,657
So for the second one it was 15 inches.

270
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,062
Okay?

271
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:37,282
Now, we're on the last
part, that means the

272
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:39,372
number three person sets up the ramp.

273
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:40,933
Are you the number three person?

274
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:43,662
So set up the ramp, where's
your other dictionary?

275
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,563
Okay, so then we have to
use the dictionary, okay?

276
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:49,026
Can you let go?

might be pretty cool, huh?

- No, number one gets to.

- You know what, I think
we mixed it up.

Now, Selena lets go of the car.

289
