1
00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:01,951
- [Teacher] So what about this part?

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:03,252
Is this any different,

3
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:04,668
or is this part the same as last time?

4
00:00:04,668 --> 00:00:06,781
- [Rileen] It's different because--
- [Chris] Well--

5
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:08,256
- [Teacher] Let's let Rileen talk, Chris.

6
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,031
- [Rileen] It's different
because it's wider,

7
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,099
and it got right to here and the other one

8
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,678
came up to there.

9
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,606
- [Chris] It's like six more,

10
00:00:15,606 --> 00:00:19,019
it's like ten more
centimeters than last time.

11
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,093
- [Teacher] Okay. So once you guys
finish with your observations,

12
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:26,870
you guys can start working
on collecting your data

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,483
for the canyon and for the delta.

14
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:50,773
(Background Chatter)

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,488
- [Girl in floral] See, this part is completely dry.

16
00:00:56,454 --> 00:00:58,150
- [Elondra] It's pretty much almost half.

17
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,286
- [Girl in floral] Water's above the side.

18
00:01:00,286 --> 00:01:02,345
- [Cameron] Watch that, 
watch that, it's gonna fall.

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,254
- [Girl in floral] Look at that.

20
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:06,489
- [Cameron] It's like a boat 
going down a waterfall.

21
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:08,340
- [Girl in floral] That was sand.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,082
- [Cameron] I know.

23
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:13,095
(Background Chatter)

24
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:20,165
- [Xander] The water has stopped going.

25
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,074
- [Cameron] One minute's passed.

26
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:25,138
- [Girl in floral] Thirty?

27
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:26,647
-[Cameron] Oh.

28
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,383
- [Both] (giggles)

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,314
- [Girl in floral] There's a--start to get ready.

30
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:32,986
It's not done playing.

31
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,690
- [Cameron] It's still not done (Background Chatter).

32
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,314
- [Xander] Well, the water--

33
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:40,523
- [Girl in floral] Look at this, look at this.

34
00:01:40,523 --> 00:01:41,731
- [Cameron] I know, we're still dry.

35
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,565
- [Xander] There's a pool of water at the end.

36
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:45,121
- [Elondra] There's a pool of water at the end.

37
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,211
- [Cameron] Look at this, there's
a dent, there's a dent.

38
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:47,871
- [Xander] Oh, wow.

39
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:49,171
- [Cameron] Right here's dry.

40
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,145
- [Teacher] Okay, why do you guys think this part

41
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,793
didn't get any water?

42
00:01:53,793 --> 00:01:56,324
- [Cameron] Because it probably went under?

43
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,833
- [Teacher] So Cameron says it went under,

44
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,319
Xander, what were you saying?

45
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,433
- [Xander] It was going too fast

46
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:02,477
and it didn't--it was probably right here,

47
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,590
so it didn't decide to
go all the way over here,

48
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,183
and it went right here.

49
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,367
- [Cameron] It formed a lake right here.

50
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,387
- [Xander] It went the easiest route.

51
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,771
So it's got eight or nine minutes.

52
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,441
- [Girl in floral] So,
now ten, nine minutes.

53
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,670
- [Teacher] Is water still draining?

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,482
- [Cameron] Yeah, the water's still there.

55
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,943
- [Teacher] When are you guys gonna
decide when the end time is?

56
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,731
- [Cameron] When this goes.

57
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,374
- [Girl in Floral] There's
been nine minutes, right?

58
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:27,957
And the water is dripping.

59
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:28,907
- [Cameron] Last time we got 15 minutes.

60
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,300
- [Girl in floral] The
water's dripping into basin.

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,810
- [Cameron] Last time we got 15 minutes.

62
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,388
- [Teacher] So how does it all compare?

63
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,409
- [Cameron] Because, um, it compares
because it's almost the same,

64
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:38,195
and look at, it like
poured a pool or something.

65
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,610
- [Teacher] Cameron, you were saying
this one is almost the same?

66
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,305
Like it took the same amount of time?

67
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,721
- [Cameron] No.
- [Elondra] No.

68
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,695
- [Cameron] No, I'm saying it's getting there.

69
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,273
- [Elondra] No, the other one's longer

70
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:48,922
because it drained a bigger whole.

71
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:49,735
- [Cameron] Yeah.

72
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,592
- [Teacher] So Elondra, how was the
time different for this one?

73
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:52,790
- [Cameron] How it was like similar?

74
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,551
- [Teacher] Let's hear what Elondra says.

75
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,662
- [Elondra] This one went faster.

76
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:56,684
- This one went faster?

77
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:57,589
- Yeah, way faster.

78
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,099
- So you're saying it's
similar, not too different?

79
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,167
But Elondra's saying it went faster.

80
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,328
Do you agree with her?

81
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:02,790
- [Cameron] Yeah, and the deposition

82
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,321
it's like way over here.

83
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:07,411
Way across there.

84
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:08,943
(Background Chatter)

85
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:10,430
- [Teacher] You guys are, I think, pretty much done

86
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,799
with your water draining now.

87
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:12,891
- [Cameron] Okay, so--

88
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,516
- [Xander] Nine or ten minutes and it's done.

89
00:03:14,516 --> 00:03:16,002
- [Teacher] So you guys want to
record your end time?

90
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:18,203
- [Cameron] No, no, it's still going.

91
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:24,255
- [Teacher] It's okay if there's still
a little bit of water left in.

92
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,741
Once it stops draining, you guys can put

93
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:27,714
the tape over here and you guys can start

94
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:30,013
taking your measurements.

95
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:32,539
- [Xander] Where do we get the toothpicks?

96
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,704
- [Elondra] Don't we have to know what time it is?

97
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:41,647
- [Girl in floral] 10:30, right?

98
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:44,039
- [Elondra] Was this when the chocolate melts?

99
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,245
- [Cameron] When's the chocolate melt?

100
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:48,716
Elondra.

101
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:49,464
- [Elondra] What?

102
00:03:49,464 --> 00:03:51,332
- [Cameron] It looks like chocolate--

103
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,888
- [Teacher] So are you guys ready to
start taking your measurements?

104
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:53,933
- [Xander] Yeah.

105
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,047
- [Teacher] Why don't you guys open
up your science notebooks

106
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:56,649
so you have the table in front of you,

107
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:58,878
and I'll bring by a toothpick
so you can get started

108
00:03:58,878 --> 00:03:59,900
on the writing.

109
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,713
- [Girl in floral] Yeah.

110
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:02,640
- [Xander] I think the widest part is right here.

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,419
- [Girl in floral] Can I do the poking?

112
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:04,208
- [Xander] Huh?

113
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,182
- [Girl in floral] Can I do the poking?

114
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,332
- [Teacher] You guys have your measuring tape out?

115
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,979
- [Xander] We have to go get the measuring tape.

116
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,929
- [Girl in floral] Tape that back up.

117
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,763
- [Xander] Here, our widest part is right here.

118
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:21,014
- [Girl in floral] Widest part is that.

119
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:23,684
- [Xander] No, no, no, you're
not supposed to poke it.

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,010
- [Girl in floral] How long is that?

121
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,426
- [Xander] It's about to here.

122
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:37,593
- [Cameron] Okay, we got what we need.

123
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:39,489
- [Elondra] Go from centimeters.

124
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,147
- [Girl in floral] Centimeters.

125
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,089
- [Xander] Aw, Cameron.

126
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,916
Cameron, you messed it up.

127
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,974
- [Girl in floral] That's not our longest part.

128
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:58,346
Our longest part is this.

129
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:01,202
- [Xander] Okay, we have to redo it.

130
00:05:01,202 --> 00:05:03,739
Wait, where does we start?

131
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,339
- [Cameron] Right here.

132
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,603
- [Xander] Here, you do the poking.

133
00:05:09,603 --> 00:05:10,989
Don't poke it into the thing,

134
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,057
but how deep is it?

135
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:14,031
Here, grab it.

136
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:16,027
- [Elondra] (Giggles)

137
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,606
- [Xander] No, you're not supposed to do that.

138
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,464
Remember what she did?

139
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:22,709
- [Girl in floral] Okay, this right here.

140
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,744
- [Xander] It's about three centimeters.

141
00:05:32,744 --> 00:05:34,334
- [Cameron] Three centimeters.

142
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,195
- [Elondra] So, depth of straight channel

143
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:41,724
is three centimeters.

144
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:56,027
- [Elondra] Okay, what do we measure next?

145
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,717
- [Cameron] Okay, time to do the width.

146
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,346
- [Elondra] How much was it?

147
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:04,438
- [Cameron] Three centimeters.

148
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:05,529
- [Elondra] Three? Okay.

149
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:07,247
What's the widest?

150
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:14,381
- [Girl in floral] Where's the measuring tape?

151
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:27,642
Around six centimeters.

152
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:28,780
[Elondra] - How much?

153
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,150
[Xander] - Six.

154
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,914
- [Cameron] Six centimeters.

155
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:34,213
- [Elondra] Six.

156
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:37,023
Okay, now we need to do width of soil drop

157
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,567
to end of stream channel.

158
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,493
It's all this, it's all from right here.

159
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:43,257
- [Xander] It's from here to here.

160
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:46,311
You guys, we need the tape measure.

161
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,817
- [Girl in floral] Yeah, width, from here to here.

162
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,677
No, it's this long.

163
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,441
I've got it with my fingers.

164
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,502
This long.

165
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,805
- [Xander] It's about 15.

166
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:01,221
- [Girl in floral] No, it's 14 and a half.

167
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,241
- [Xander] No that's 15.

168
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,936
- [Elondra] Yeah, 15.

169
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:06,353
- [Girl in floral] Oh yeah, 15.

170
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:08,048
- [Elondra] Same with the other one.

171
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:09,743
- [Cameron] 15.

172
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:13,155
- [Elondra] It goes all the way to the end.

173
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,975
- [Cameron] Yeah, length.

174
00:07:18,194 --> 00:07:20,493
- [Elondra] Okay, 29.

175
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:21,491
- [Cameron] How many?

176
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,186
- [Xander and Elondra] 29.

177
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:26,948
- [Girl in floral] Yeah, and depth of soil dripped

178
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:28,410
at the end of end of the stream channel.

179
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,757
Where's the toothpick?

180
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,267
- [Girl in gray] So right here...

181
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,591
- [Cody] Right there, yeah.

182
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:52,132
- [Girl in gray] Okay, where's the time?

183
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:54,542
- [Girl in gray](Background Chatter)
- [Kendra] (Background Chatter)

184
00:07:58,726 --> 00:08:00,648
- [Kendra] (Giggles)

185
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:05,460
- [Girl in gray] Okay, so, can you hold that there?

186
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,410
(Background Chatter)

187
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,815
- [Jorge] How much is it?

188
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,809
- [Girl in gray] Five centimeters.

189
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:18,761
- [Kendra] How many?

190
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:20,734
- [Girl in gray] Five.

191
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,754
- [Kendra] Five c-m.

192
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:25,866
- [Kendra] Okay, width of the
soil dropped at the end

193
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:27,213
of the stream channel.

194
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,047
So right here.

195
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,139
- [Cody] We're gonna actually move to here.

196
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:34,612
- [Kendra] No no, width.

197
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,656
- [Cody] Oh, width?

198
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:40,826
- [Girl in gray] Looks about...

199
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:42,254
- [Cody] 11 centimeters, maybe?

200
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:44,501
- [Kendra] 11 centimeters.

201
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:49,693
Alright, length of the soil dropped

202
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:51,481
at the end of the stream channel.

203
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:54,152
So now we're measuring that.

204
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:56,913
- [Girl in gray] Here, you can do it.

205
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,121
- [Teacher] So what're you guys
working on measuring now?

206
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,747
- [Girl in gray] Length.

207
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:03,069
- [Cody] We've got a long length.

208
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,180
- [Girl in gray] 27.

209
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,759
- [Cody] 28.

210
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,408
- [Kendra] 28, yeah.
- [Cody] 28 centimeters.

211
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,183
- [Girl in gray] Jorge, you can measure--

212
00:09:14,183 --> 00:09:15,576
- [Cody] Now what do we measure?

213
00:09:15,576 --> 00:09:17,131
Depth of soil dropped at end of the--

214
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,525
- [Girl in gray] Wait, what was it?

215
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,802
- [Kendra] 28.

216
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:23,308
- [Cody] Depth of soil dropped at
the end of the stream channel.

217
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:24,654
- [Kendra] Where's the toothpick?

218
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:26,326
- [Girl in gray] I'm letting Jorge do it.

219
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,510
- [Cody] Okay.

220
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,927
- [Kendra] Jorge, you can do this one.

221
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:30,413
- [Cody] So, maybe poke it here.

222
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:32,572
- [Kendra] Poke it in there.

223
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,546
- [Cody] Now put your finger down.

224
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:36,589
Put your finger down where it is.

225
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:39,422
- [Kendra] Slide it down until you feel the dirt.

226
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:40,606
- [Cody] Good.

227
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:45,208
- [Girl in gray] Bring it over to Kendra.

228
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,908
- [Cody] So you can kinda see
the dirt right there.

229
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:50,551
That's not even a centimeter.

230
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,100
- [Kendra] You start here.

231
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,004
- [Cody] Okay.

232
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:57,440
That's not even a centimeter.

233
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,205
- [Kendra] That's three millimeters.

234
00:09:59,205 --> 00:10:01,573
- [Girl in gray] So we round it down to zero centimeters.

235
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:06,942
- [Cody] Okay.

236
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,521
- [Kendra] Zero.

237
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,425
Okay, we're all done.

238
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,399
- [Cody] No, we still have to--

239
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,789
- [Kendra] "Work on your bird's-eye
view picture in your notebook."

240
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,395
(Background Chatter)

241
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,177
- [Girl in gray] Up in the big can.
- [Cody] Oh no, they're over there.

242
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,233
- [Girl in gray] Okay. The same bird's-eye
view or a different view?

243
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,758
- [Kendra] That's what I was going to--
(Background Chatter)

244
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,381
- [Kendra] I'm especially gonna draw in here,

245
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,696
because that's really interesting.

246
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:48,127
- [Girl in gray] Really interesting.

247
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:50,473
- [Both] (laughs)

248
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:54,211
- [Girl in gray] Did Cody just go get something?

249
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:55,279
- [Kendra] Yes, he did.

250
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,276
- [Girl in gray] Oh my gosh, he's so nice.

251
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,971
- [Teacher] So did you guys finish taking your data?

252
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,619
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, we're gonna do
our bird's-eye view.

253
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,036
- [Teacher] Before you guys look
at your bird's-eye view,

254
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,336
I want you to share.

255
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:04,520
What'd you guys find from your data?

256
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,913
So let's look at your data tables for a minute.

257
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:07,004
- [Girl in gray] Okay.

258
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,816
- [Cody] It kind of made like a cave.

259
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:10,093
- [Girl in gray] No, right here.

260
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:11,114
- [Teacher] Yeah.

261
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:12,484
- [Girl in gray] So I see the 
difference right here.

262
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:14,810
In the depth of the stream channel,

263
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,121
the basic stream was actually more

264
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,956
than the rushing river.

265
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:21,465
- [Teacher] What was more?

266
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:24,396
- [Girl in gray] Like, in centimeters,
so one centimeter off.

267
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:27,262
- [Teacher] So, Alejandro's looking at the depth

268
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:29,514
of the stream channel,

269
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:31,256
and the last time it was
three centimeters deep

270
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,578
and this time it was only
two centimeters deep?

271
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:35,481
So last time it was actually deeper.

272
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,850
How about which one was wider?

273
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,173
- [Gitl in htsy] The rushing river.

274
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:41,077
- [Teacher] So the rushing river made
a wider stream channel?

275
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:41,983
- [Kendra] Yeah.

276
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,121
- [Girl in gray] I think the reason why it was wider

277
00:11:43,121 --> 00:11:44,537
is because more water came in.

278
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,416
- [Kendra] It basically didn't
spend enough time going in,

279
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,065
it basically just went--

280
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,388
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, and it made it

281
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,571
more curved-inish and stuff.

282
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,080
- [Teacher] Okay. Jorge, what'd you notice?

283
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,168
- [Jorge] I noticed that, right here,

284
00:11:57,168 --> 00:11:58,811
it made a little cave,

285
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:03,811
and I think something like water,

286
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,720
I think there was a
little whirlpool there.

287
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,137
- [Cody] Yeah, there was.

288
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:09,669
- [Girl in gray] There were a bunch of whirlpools.

289
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:12,014
- [Cody] Yeah, there were doubles.

290
00:12:12,014 --> 00:12:13,547
- [Girl in gray] There's one right here and here.

291
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,776
- [Jorge] So I think it broke the water 
(Background Chatter).

292
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,098
- [Kendra] I saw one little whirlpool right there,

293
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:19,514
and another one over here.

294
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:20,582
- [Cody] I saw one here.

295
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:21,952
- [Teacher] So the water was kinda
doing some different things

296
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:23,229
in some of these places?

297
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,715
- [Cody] Yeah, I think it's
'cause it curves like that,

298
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:27,223
so the bubbles keep on spinning

299
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,336
if the water's coming through.

300
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:32,372
- [Jorge] Yeah, so the water's--
(Background Chatter)

301
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,814
- [Teacher] So what about the delta?

302
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:37,300
The deposition?

303
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,389
How is this different than
your first experiment?

304
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,292
- [Girl in gray] Oh my gosh, it was
five centimeters bigger.

305
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:43,476
- [Teacher] Five centimeters bigger?

306
00:12:43,476 --> 00:12:44,869
What'd you notice, Jorge?

307
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:47,052
- [Jorge] The biggest part was that

308
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:48,932
it was only this part right here.

309
00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:50,395
- [Teacher] Okay.

310
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:53,460
- [Kendra] Yeah, that was the
longest part that was part of it all.

311
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,200
- [Teacher] So Cody, I noticed that, this time,

312
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,638
how deep was your delta?

313
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:02,864
- [Cody] Our delta, which would
be to get that soil?

314
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:03,886
- [Teacher] Yeah.

315
00:13:03,886 --> 00:13:04,884
- [Cody] Zero centimeters.

316
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,788
- [Teacher] So does that mean there's no delta?

317
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:08,460
So how did you guys come up with zero?

318
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,710
- [Cody] 'Cause it was three millimeters,

319
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,754
so we had to round down.

320
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:16,246
- [Teacher] Okay, so you guys have your data.

321
00:13:16,246 --> 00:13:18,220
- [Girl in gray] And the length of the soil--

322
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,112
- [Teacher] It was a lot wider, wasn't it?

323
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:21,575
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, the length of the soil

324
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:24,640
was like four centimeters bigger.

325
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,264
It was from the end right here

326
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:30,236
and it continued down.

327
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,606
- [Teacher] So you guys, remember,

328
00:13:31,606 --> 00:13:33,533
we're gonna take this data--

329
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:35,692
- [Jorge] Someday are we gonna put
more of that stuff in here?

330
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,409
- [Teacher] Oh, put more of the earth material in?

331
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,407
- [Jorge] Yeah.

332
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:42,347
- [Teacher] And see what it would be like
if you added more material?

333
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:44,158
- [Jorge] (Background Chatter)

334
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,992
- [Teacher] Okay, maybe that would be a
question we could investigate.

335
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,455
- [Kendra] Maybe the
delta would be thicker

336
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:50,496
because there's not
enough room for all of it.

337
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,075
- [Jorge] You know why
I'm asking you that?

338
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,978
Because I think it would be deeper,

339
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:57,369
because right here it only
makes little ones here,

340
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,411
but the other one would
probably make it bigger

341
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:01,920
because it has more space.

342
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,196
- [Teacher] Okay. So you think these
channels might be bigger?

343
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:05,357
- [Jorge] Yeah.

344
00:14:05,357 --> 00:14:06,634
- [Teacher] If there was more earth material?

345
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:08,514
- [Girl in gray] What
if we made an even bigger hole?

346
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,813
- [Teacher] Oh, so you're wondering if
it was an even bigger flood,

347
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,160
what might happen?

348
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,458
- [Jorge] Maybe that would be
a hole like this big.

349
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,339
- [Teacher] Yeah, you guys are doing
that thing that scientists do

350
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,802
after they do an investigation,

351
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:19,334
they start asking more questions,

352
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:21,401
"I wonder, what if we tried this."

353
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,212
So you guys have got your data,

354
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,326
so we'll be ready to put this

355
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:26,138
in the class data table, right?

356
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:28,227
Find our averages probably on Thursday?

357
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:30,851
Right now, you guys are
going to be working on--

358
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:34,102
you want to make sure you
get the runoff sample,

359
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:36,377
draw what that looks like today,

360
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,142
we'll see what it looks like
when it settles out later,

361
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:40,533
and then you guys are going to
work on your bird's eye view,

362
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,507
and think about where's the humus,

363
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,829
where's the gravel, where's the clay,

364
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,058
so you can add that into the picture.

365
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:48,683
- [Cody] Hey guys, I'm gonna like--

366
00:14:48,683 --> 00:14:50,123
- [Girl in gray] Yeah,
I was thinking the same thing,

367
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,261
like rip this up.

368
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,491
- [Cody] Whoa, there's the biggest--

369
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,907
- [Girl in gray] Oh, that's cool!

370
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:56,856
- [Kendra] Ms. Maher, it made a big dip.

371
00:14:56,856 --> 00:14:58,476
- [Cody] I'm guessing that
some water's still down there.
