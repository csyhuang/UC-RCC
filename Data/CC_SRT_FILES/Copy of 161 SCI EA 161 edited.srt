1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,985
- [Teacher] Okay guys, good morning
and welcome to class today.

2
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:07,076
We're going to continue
our discussion on energy,

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:09,923
but we're going to extend
it to cover some new points

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:11,638
that we haven't talked about yet.

5
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:13,414
So what I'd like for you to do first

6
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,722
before we get started with out discussion

7
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:18,495
is look at the big idea, the big idea

8
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:19,659
for just a moment.

9
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:21,715
So the big idea that we're
going to talk about today

10
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:24,115
is how do you think the sun

11
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,496
is going to help you
shoot the stretchy lizard

12
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:28,873
across the table?

13
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:30,502
So everybody's got their
little stretchy lizard.

14
00:00:30,502 --> 00:00:32,546
Without shooting them,
we're not doing anything

15
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,715
with them yet, I'd like for
you to talk in your table group

16
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,902
and see if you can come
up with a big idea.

17
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,732
I'm going to give you
30 seconds to do that

18
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,973
and then we'll just go around
and see what you think.

19
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:45,415
Okay, so 30 seconds to think
about what's the big idea.

20
00:00:46,372 --> 00:01:05,117
(Background Chatter)

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,319
[Teacher] Do you know who your
spokesperson is going to be?

22
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:17,827
- [Student] (mumbles)
(Background Chatter)

23
00:01:18,264 --> 00:01:20,844
- [Teacher] Alright guys, it's been 30 seconds.

24
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,767
I'm going to go to each table.

25
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:28,012
If you could just have
your spokesperson ready,

26
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,136
you could just tell me
what your big idea is.

27
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:31,309
We're going to put it up here

28
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:32,987
and we're going to come back to it

29
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:34,946
at the end of class
and see how we've done.

30
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:37,694
Alright, so how about we'll
start with you guys back here

31
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:38,993
since there's just two of you.

32
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:39,840
Alright, what do you think?

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,094
Shawn, are you going to speak?

34
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:45,367
- [Shawn] The sun would warm up the lizard

35
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:47,190
and make it go across the table.

36
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,238
- [Teacher] Okay, so the sun might
warm up the lizard.

37
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:52,913
I just put L for lizard, that's alright,

38
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,102
and make it go across the table.

39
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,334
Robert, how about your table,

40
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,500
who's your spokesperson going to be?

41
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:06,359
- [Student] The energy from the sun,

42
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:09,840
once it shines on the lizard

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,376
it would give the lizard energy.

44
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:18,437
- [Teacher] Okay, the energy from the
sun will shine on the lizard.

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,819
Right, is that okay?

46
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,701
Who's your spokesperson?

47
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,761
- [Student] We said that the sun

48
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,651
might make the lizard melt

49
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:32,009
and make it sticky and then maybe it would

50
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,539
shoot across the table.

51
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,766
- [Teacher] Okay, so it might make it melt

52
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:39,576
and sticky and that'll make
it shoot across the table.

53
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,383
Is that what you said?

54
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,783
Alright, Kendrick who's your
spokesperson going to be?

55
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:46,518
- [Students] Blaire

56
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:47,370
- [Teacher] It was unanimous.

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,759
Alright, Blaire, what do you guys have?

58
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,854
- [Blaire] We were
going to say things like

59
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:53,431
the other people said that
like the energy from the sun

60
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,383
is going...

61
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,730
- [Teacher] Is going to do what?

62
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,738
- [Blaire] Like the energy
from the sun would like

63
00:03:01,738 --> 00:03:04,761
shine on the lizard and it's going

64
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,471
to make it jump

65
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:07,847
- [Teacher] Okay.

66
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,878
Shine and make it jump.

67
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,786
Nicole, did you guys decide
who your spokesperson's

68
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,356
going to be?

69
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:19,886
- [Student] Arrington.

70
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:20,732
- [Teacher] Arrington.

71
00:03:20,732 --> 00:03:22,198
- [Arrington] The sun would
gives energy to the lizard

72
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,107
to help it sling.

73
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:26,211
- [Teacher] Okay, so the sun

74
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,700
gives energy and I didn't
hear the last part.

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,139
You want to tell me?

76
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,235
- [Student] That helps it.

77
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:37,331
- [Teacher] That helps it, okay.

78
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,958
And last but not least, Jada?

79
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,995
- [Student] We think that the sun

80
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:50,871
give heat to the (mumbles)

81
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:54,181
and make it more elastic
so it would stretch.

82
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,472
- [Teacher] Okay, so the sun would give heat

83
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:02,020
to make it more elastic?

84
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,304
I'm sorry, what was the last part again?

85
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:06,550
- [Teacher] Like make it more elastic

86
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,085
so it will stretch more.

87
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,261
- [Teacher] So it'll stretch farther, good.

88
00:04:16,157 --> 00:04:18,381
Alright, so what I'd like to do now

89
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:21,546
is I'd like to just kind of
recall some of the things

90
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:24,559
that we might already know about energy.

91
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:27,008
So if I call your number, I
would like you to think about

92
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:30,824
what do you know about, let's
start with potential energy.

93
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:33,584
What do you know about potential energy?

94
00:04:33,584 --> 00:04:35,609
So if I call your number just
tell me one factor, one thing

95
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,415
that you know about it
or an example of it.

96
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,714
Alright, we'll start with 15.

97
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:44,737
- [Student 15] When an object is
like still, it doesn't move,

98
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:46,302
it's holding it in.

99
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:48,721
- [Teacher] Okay, still, doesn't
move, it's holding it in.

100
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,795
How about number eight?

101
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,210
Robert.

102
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:57,676
Something you know about potential energy

103
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:00,320
or an example of it.

104
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,339
- [Robert] The lizards.

105
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,379
- [Teacher] Alright, very good.

106
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,708
When the lizard is still?

107
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,126
When it's moving, what do you think?

108
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:23,575
- [Robert] Still?

109
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,301
- [Teacher] Alright, very good.

110
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:26,570
19.

111
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,358
- [Student 19] It's stored energy.

112
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:32,727
- [Teacher] Alright, it's stored energy

113
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,595
and I'll do one more, number two.

114
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:37,982
Potential energy.

115
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:40,758
An example or something
that you remember about it.

116
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,100
- [Student 2] The pencil is still.

117
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,005
- [Teacher] The pencil is still.

118
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:43,981
Alright, very good.

119
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:45,536
Now I know we haven't
talked about these topics

120
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,540
too much yet, but I know from your pretest

121
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,491
you guys had a lot of
background knowledge on it.

122
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:51,193
Okay, the next thing I'd like to know

123
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,840
is what do you know, what
examples do you have,

124
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,025
what can you remember
about kinetic energy.

125
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,647
So we talked about potential.

126
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:00,188
Now I'd like to know a couple
things that you might know

127
00:06:00,188 --> 00:06:01,722
about kinetic energy.

128
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:03,057
Alright, so if I call
your number let me know

129
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:03,810
what you think.

130
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,893
Number 20?

131
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,638
- [Student 20] A car moving.

132
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,578
- [Teacher] A car moving.

133
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,940
Alright, number 13.

134
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,394
- [Student 13] A paint can being dropped.

135
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:19,331
- [Teacher] A paint can being
dropped, alright, very good.

136
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,545
Number 14.

137
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,279
- [Student 14] When you
push a pencil and it rolls.

138
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,241
- [Teacher] Alright,
when you push a pencil

139
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:27,060
and it rolls, very good.

140
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,909
And how about number
seven, we'll do one more.

141
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:33,821
- [Student 7] Like the energy of motion, 
like the (mumbles).

142
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:38,794
- [Teacher] The energy of motion?

143
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:39,737
- [Student 7] Yeah.
- [Teacher] Thanks.

144
00:06:39,737 --> 00:06:41,110
Alright, and if I didn't call your number

145
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,221
and you want to contribute
about either potential

146
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,476
or kinetic.

147
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,220
Anybody have anything
else to add about it?

148
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,426
Dylan?

149
00:06:47,426 --> 00:06:50,308
- [Dylan] Kinetic is when like the stored energy

150
00:06:50,308 --> 00:06:52,730
from the potential energy leaks all out

151
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,000
and it starts pulling.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,875
- [Teacher] Alright, very good

153
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,835
and that's a great way to
start into the next part,

154
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,202
what we're going to use
the lizards for today.

155
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:04,036
Alright, so what I would
like to know from you guys,

156
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:05,931
is everybody has a bucket
on their table, right?

157
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,734
- [Class] Um-hum, yeah.
- -Teacher] Okay.

158
00:07:07,734 --> 00:07:09,298
And you can raise your hand for this part:

159
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,347
how can you, from your seat,

160
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,802
how can you make the stretchy lizard

161
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,088
get into the bucket?

162
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:15,932
Anthony.

163
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:16,750
- [Anthony] Shoot it.

164
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,438
- [Teacher] You can shoot it.

165
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,192
- [Student] You can just toss it in.

166
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:22,202
- [Teacher] You can just toss it in there.

167
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:27,767
- [Student] You could pull its tail.

168
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,745
- [Teacher] You could pull
its tail and stretch it.

169
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:30,880
- [Student] You could drop it in there.

170
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,990
- [Teacher] You could just drop it in there.

171
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,065
It's not too far away.

172
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,526
Anybody else?

173
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:37,771
Okay, how about, and I'm not asking

174
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,812
for a demonstration yet,
we'll get to demonstration,

175
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:40,768
I promise.

176
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:43,610
How about if I asked you
guys, instead of in the bucket

177
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,373
at your table, how could
you get it into a bucket

178
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,642
at your neighbor's table?

179
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:51,106
At your neighbor's table?

180
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,107
Javious, what do you think?

181
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,012
- [Javious] You could toss it.

182
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:54,682
- [Teacher] You could toss it.

183
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,814
Arrington.

184
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:58,046
- [Arrington] You could sling it.

185
00:07:58,046 --> 00:07:59,939
- [Teacher] You could sling it.

186
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:01,627
Wilson.

187
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:02,760
That was your idea?

188
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,789
Alright.

189
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,033
- [Student] Walk over
there and put it in it.

190
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,007
- [Teacher] Yeah that's true.

191
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,655
I didn't say you had to
stay in your seat did I?

192
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,274
You could walk over
there and just put it in.

193
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:10,490
Gavin.

194
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,748
- [Gavin] You could like throw it.

195
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:13,808
- [Teacher] You might throw it.

196
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:15,166
Is that what you were going to say Dana?

197
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:15,956
Alright.

198
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:16,852
- [Student] Shoot it.

199
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,270
- [Teacher] You could shoot it, alright, very good.

200
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,557
- [Student] You could bend it back.

201
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:23,325
- [Teacher] Yep, you could bend it
back and shoot, very good.

202
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:27,587
How about if I asked you to shoot it

203
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,945
from one side of the room to the other?

204
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,327
Jade, I'll start with you.

205
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,078
- [Jade] Sling it.

206
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:32,936
- [Teacher] You could sling it.

207
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:33,912
Lewis.

208
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,490
- [Lewis] Like you
said, you could shoot it.

209
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,512
- [Teacher] Yeah, you could shoot it.

210
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:37,069
Anthony.

211
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:37,696
- [Anthony] You could throw it.

212
00:08:37,696 --> 00:08:38,393
- [Teacher] You could throw it.

213
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,706
So we're kind of hearing
the same things, right?

214
00:08:40,706 --> 00:08:42,275
We're kind of hearing--

215
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:42,992
Go ahead.

216
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:43,938
- [Student] You could
walk over and drop it.

217
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:44,916
- [Teacher] You could walk over and drop it.

218
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,617
I didn't say you had to stay in your seat.

219
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:47,910
Alright.

220
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,601
What would be the
difference, though, between

221
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:54,036
the bucket at your table,

222
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:56,159
the bucket your neighbor's table,

223
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,792
shooting it across the room,

224
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:58,790
going out on the football field

225
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,014
and going for distance?

226
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:02,804
What would be the difference
between what you did?

227
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:07,122
What difference would you
have between this bucket here,

228
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:10,276
the bucket at your neighbor's
table and so forth?

229
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:11,534
John, what do you think?

230
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,681
- [John] The amount of energy
you're putting into it.

231
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:15,221
- [Teacher] Can you just
show me without actually

232
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,144
shooting it, for example?

233
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:20,923
- [John] Like if you're trying to
get it into this bucket,

234
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:23,359
I only have to go like
this or drop it in there.

235
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,043
If I were trying to
send it across the room

236
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:26,530
I'd have to really stretch it out.

237
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,276
- [Teacher] Okay.

238
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,578
- [Student] The distance away from the bucket.

239
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,226
- [Teacher] Okay, so what
would you do differently

240
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:36,641
to make it go a different distance?

241
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:41,506
- [Student] Stretch it more.

242
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,643
- [Teacher] I might stretch it further,

243
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:45,485
is that what you two were going to say?

244
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:50,013
- [Student] The more potential energy
or kinetic energy it has.

245
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:51,682
- [Teacher] The more potential energy,

246
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,342
the more kinetic energy it has?

247
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,174
So when you talk about the lizard,

248
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:56,335
what do you mean when you say

249
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,593
the potential energy that it has?

250
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,503
How's it getting potential energy?

251
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:02,636
What does that mean?

252
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:05,149
- [Student] Before you sling
it, it's just sitting there--

253
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,786
(mumbles).

254
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,845
- [Teacher] Alright, so when it's just
sitting there it's potential.

255
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,860
What about when you stretch
it, what do you think that is?

256
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,937
- [Student] Kinetic.

257
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,471
- [Teacher] Okay, have you let it go yet?

258
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:21,746
- [Student] No.

259
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,814
- [Teacher] Alright, so we'll think
about that for a little bit.

260
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:26,450
What I'd like for you guys to
do is talk to your neighbors

261
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,352
at your table, or if you don't
like what they have to say,

262
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,105
you can think about it on your own.

263
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:33,593
I'd like for you to make a hypothesis

264
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:36,015
and I'd like for your
hypothesis to start with

265
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:39,870
"I think" and then think
about what we just said

266
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,331
about how you would get
the lizard in the bucket

267
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:45,397
at your table versus
your neighbor's table.

268
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,009
What do you think you
would do differently?

269
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,213
"I think if I", do what to the lizard

270
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,309
it's going to go in the bucket at my table

271
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:54,667
versus the one at the next table.

272
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,839
So make a hypothesis
about how you could test

273
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,350
how can you get the lizard in that bucket

274
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,683
versus the next one.

275
00:11:00,683 --> 00:11:01,810
- [Student] By slinging it.

276
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,366
- [Teacher] Yeah, talk amongst yourselves

277
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:04,585
and see what you guys think.

278
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:07,018
Alright, I'll give you
30 seconds to do that.

279
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:39,784
(Background Chatter)

280
00:11:40,747 --> 00:11:43,059
- [Teacher] But then compare it to
the next table as well.

281
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,725
What would you have to do
differently to the lizard

282
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,334
to get it in this bucket
versus the next one?

283
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,305
That's what I want you to do.

284
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:52,824
Okay, alright.

285
00:11:52,824 --> 00:11:54,899
So let me just have...

286
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,408
Let's hear one table. Gavin,

287
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,411
I kind of liked what I
was hearing from yours.

288
00:11:58,411 --> 00:11:59,980
Ready guys?

289
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,110
Gavin, I liked what I was
hearing from your table

290
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,085
when I was walking around.

291
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:07,741
Tell me what you guys came
up with for a hypothesis.

292
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:10,623
- [Gavin] That if you were
shooting it at your table

293
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,630
you'd only pull back a little
bit, but if you're shooting

294
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,414
it across to another person's
table, you'd have to pull

295
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:17,835
it back farther.

296
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:22,014
- [Teacher] Okay, any other
table have a similar hypothesis?

297
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:25,308
So their hypothesis then
was if they want to shoot it

298
00:12:25,308 --> 00:12:28,961
into the bucket at their table,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

299
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,185
they'd only have to
stretch it a little bit,

300
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,798
but if they wanted to shoot
it at their neighbor's table,

301
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:34,693
they'd have to stretch it further.

302
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,139
Did anybody have a similar
hypothesis to that?

303
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:37,732
You guys did.

304
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:39,413
How about you guys,
what did you say Nicole?

305
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:43,490
- [Nicole] We said that maybe we'd have to

306
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,399
aim our trajectory much different

307
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,966
that we would between tables.

308
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,902
- [Teacher] Okay, so not only

309
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,493
the amount of stretch,
but also the trajectory

310
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:55,468
of how you aim it.

311
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:56,223
Alright, very good.

312
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:58,202
How about you guys over there?

313
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:03,955
- [Student] You'd have to really aim

314
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,253
and focus on how much
power you put into it.

315
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,635
- [Teacher] Alright, very good.

316
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:09,620
And I know you guys were
coming up with the same thing.

317
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,937
So we're going to do an
experiment in just a minute

318
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:15,600
to test that hypothesis
about the amount of stretch.

319
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,301
Is the amount of stretch
related to how far

320
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:19,997
your lizard can fly?

321
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:22,811
Okay, so if that's your hypothesis,

322
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:25,937
I think the amount of stretch
that I give the lizard

323
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,588
will make it fly a different length,

324
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,160
what would the manipulated variable be?

325
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,296
What would the thing be that you change

326
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:35,632
between the different steps?

327
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,633
Anthony.

328
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:38,028
- [Anthony] How far you pull it back.

329
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,408
- [Teacher] How far you pull it back, very good.

330
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:44,511
How far you pull it or
can I put stretch also?

331
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:46,463
Good.

332
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,104
What would our dependent variable be?

333
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,732
What are you going to watch for?

334
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:52,689
How do you know if that
stretch has made a difference?

335
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:53,606
Jada?

336
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:56,109
- [Jada] (mumbles)

337
00:13:56,109 --> 00:13:58,393
- [Teacher] Alright, very good
and where else might it go?

338
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:01,245
- [Jada] (mumble)

339
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:02,861
- [Teacher] Right, but you're
talking about your bucket

340
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,395
and you're also talking about--

341
00:14:04,395 --> 00:14:08,521
- [Jada] (mumbles)

342
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:09,240
- [Teacher] Very good.

343
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,091
So we're talking about--

344
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:11,996
- [Jada] Distance.

345
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:12,774
- [Teacher] Alright,
so can I put that down

346
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:13,682
for the dependent?

347
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:14,412
- [Jada] Yes.

348
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:16,100
- [Teacher] Okay, good.

349
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,911
How about some constants.

350
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:22,383
What are some things that
have to stay the same?

351
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:25,262
Guys, don't let that table
do all the work, come on now.

352
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:26,174
Alright, Ada.

353
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,128
- [Ada] The type of lizard.

354
00:14:27,128 --> 00:14:29,644
- [Teacher] The type of lizard, very good.

355
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,227
Would it be fair if I gave
one table battery powered

356
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:35,690
and the other table not, right?

357
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,433
Alright, very good.

358
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:37,175
Sierra, what else?

359
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,672
- [Sierra] The size and shape of it.

360
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,304
- [Teacher] Size and
shape of it, very good.

361
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:44,072
Anything else that has to
stay constant or the same?

362
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:45,545
- [Student] How big is the container.

363
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:46,266
- [Teacher] Alright, very good.

364
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:48,164
How big is the container.

365
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,236
Wilson?

366
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:54,241
- [Wilson] How stretchy it is.

367
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,976
- [Teacher] Okay, how stretchy it is.

368
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,564
Alright, I'm going to give you 30 seconds

369
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:05,951
and what I would like for you
to do with those 30 seconds,

370
00:15:05,951 --> 00:15:07,969
is I'd like for you to practice.

371
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,436
Alright, I'd like for you
to practice at this point

372
00:15:10,436 --> 00:15:12,053
just at your table.

373
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,496
If you want to practice
on moving the bucket

374
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,519
to one end and you guys
try from the other end,

375
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:19,026
that's fine, but I would like for you guys

376
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:23,305
to control the lizards so
they stay at your area, okay.

377
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,192
Alright, go ahead.

378
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,374
Without hitting your neighbor.

379
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:27,792
Maybe move to the side, Kendra.

380
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:28,487
30 seconds.

381
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,484
Go ahead and practice and
see the amount of stretch

382
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:33,420
you give the lizard makes a difference.

383
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,278
30 seconds.

384
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:35,185
Gavin.

385
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:57,213
(Background Chatter)

386
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,681
- [Teacher] See if you
have some information

387
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,633
when you're done besides that it sticks

388
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:03,565
to your neighbor's head.

389
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,983
Alright, hold on and we'll try it again.

390
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,158
I promise we'll try it again 
at further distances

391
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:14,128
in just a minute.

392
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:16,133
Let's think guys.

393
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:20,818
Can anyone make a
conclusion that starts with:

394
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,836
"When I change the amount of stretch..."?

395
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:26,137
Can anyone make a conclusion that starts--

396
00:16:26,137 --> 00:16:27,412
Good job.

397
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:30,392
Nicole.

398
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:33,759
- [Nicole] When I change the amount of stretch...

399
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,716
If I change the amount of stretch far

400
00:16:38,716 --> 00:16:40,812
then it goes further.

401
00:16:40,812 --> 00:16:42,490
- [Teacher] Okay, if I
change the amount of stretch

402
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,733
when I make it further, it goes further?

403
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,539
Alright, Lewis.

404
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,938
- [Lewis] You might
plan for it to go one way,

405
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:53,663
but the way that you shoot it really,

406
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:56,795
it doesn't exactly go where you plan.

407
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,616
It's all over the place.

408
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,009
- [Teacher] But if we just focus back

409
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,920
to the amount of stretch and the distance--
