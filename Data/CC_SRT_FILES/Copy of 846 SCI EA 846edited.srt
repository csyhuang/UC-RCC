1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,441
- All the water goes into the jeans

2
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:06,088
and this water dripped out the bottom.

3
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:07,528
- Mmhm.

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:09,943
So, it'll drip out the bottom as it dries

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,196
and go into the ground.

6
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:14,494
Okay. Other ideas about A?

7
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:16,281
Other ideas about A?

8
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:17,373
Okay. How about B?

9
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:20,739
It disappeared. It no longer exists.

10
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:23,502
It's gone forever.

11
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,523
Maybe not forever, but it's gone.

12
00:00:25,523 --> 00:00:28,843
Anybody choose B?

13
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:29,818
No choosers for B.

14
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:30,933
Okay, how about C?

15
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,580
It's in the air in an invisible form.

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,716
Kyle.

17
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:39,663
- I think it's evaporated into a gas,

18
00:00:39,663 --> 00:00:41,962
and you can't see it.

19
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:43,262
- It evaporated into a gas

20
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:44,516
and you can't see it.

21
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:46,373
Okay, other ideas about C?

22
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:47,882
- I just have similar to Kyle's,

23
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,737
but water vapor, you can't usually see it.

24
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:53,873
- Okay, so it became water vapor,

25
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:54,937
which you can't see.

26
00:00:54,937 --> 00:00:56,028
Alright.

27
00:00:56,028 --> 00:01:00,022
How about D, it moved up to the clouds?

28
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:01,276
Lots of Ds.

29
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,040
How about Mina? What do you think?

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,616
- Well, I think it evaporated,

31
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:09,913
and then it went up, so.

32
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:11,051
- It evaporated and went up.

33
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:14,487
And when things evaporate,
they form clouds?

34
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:17,174
- Mm, no.

35
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:21,301
- Okay. So who?

36
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:24,275
Can you explain your ideas?

37
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:27,567
- Well, it was like,

38
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:32,889
actually, it did go into the clouds,

39
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:36,320
because the water's still wet, so...

40
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,881
- Okay, so when it evaporates,

41
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:38,996
it goes to clouds.

42
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:39,971
Alright.

43
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,363
Other ideas about D?

44
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:44,429
Moving to the clouds. Luke.

45
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,134
- I do think that it
turned into water vapor.

46
00:01:47,134 --> 00:01:48,244
- Okay.

47
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:50,873
- But I think that maybe clouds are there

48
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:53,659
and then it gets soaked
up by clouds, sort of.

49
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,863
- Okay. So, okay.

50
00:01:56,863 --> 00:01:58,512
Let's talk about some of these ideas.

51
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,950
So, I'm hearing the word 'evaporate'

52
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,343
from a couple different people.

53
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:04,735
What does that mean, to evaporate?

54
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:06,151
What are your ideas about that?

55
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,265
Emmie.

56
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:09,193
- Doesn't it mean to like,

57
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:12,002
when the water gets at
a certain temperature,

58
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:13,929
it turns into a gas.

59
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,485
- Okay, so when water gets
to a certain temperature,

60
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:17,145
it changes to a gas.

61
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:19,003
Other ideas about evaporate,

62
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:21,528
or what that means?

63
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:25,754
When it changes to a
gas, what's happening?

64
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:28,081
Ideas about that? Mitch?

65
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,570
- Well, maybe it first comes out

66
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,124
of the machine,

67
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:36,945
maybe the sun could

68
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:39,987
make it heat a lot

69
00:02:39,987 --> 00:02:44,189
and sort of the bubble question,

70
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,604
like maybe it could be a heat bubble

71
00:02:46,604 --> 00:02:48,090
under each town.

72
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,367
Not be an actual bubble,

73
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,200
but go up to the water cycle

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,892
and then go, come back down (muttering).

75
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,726
- Okay, so when you say
'go up to the water cycle'

76
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,305
what happens to it?

77
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,559
- It's evaporated up.

78
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,279
- It's evaporated.

79
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,927
And where is it when it evaporates?

80
00:03:02,927 --> 00:03:03,902
- In the clouds.

81
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:05,690
- In the clouds. Okay, other ideas?

82
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,410
Jake.

83
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,734
- Well, when it evaporates,

84
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:09,893
the way it works is the heat makes it

85
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:13,422
so the atoms get, go farther apart,

86
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:18,112
and that makes it change
into the state of gas.

87
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:20,922
- Okay, the atoms go farther apart.

88
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,547
So, is it still water?

89
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:23,964
- Yes, but in a different form.

90
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:25,171
- Okay. Okay.

91
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:28,539
Other ideas about evaporation?

92
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,548
And how about clouds?

93
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:33,706
So, some people are saying
when it evaporates,

94
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,563
it turns into a cloud.

95
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:36,747
What is a cloud?

96
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:37,839
Ethan, share?

97
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:40,718
- I think it's like a gas.
- Okay.

98
00:03:40,718 --> 00:03:42,436
- But then I think when it evaporates

99
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,038
and goes up to the cloud,

100
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:47,498
and then I think it will
be turned into rain.

101
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:48,426
- [Student] I agree. Yeah.

102
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:49,959
- So, first it's a gas when it's a cloud

103
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,720
and then it turns back to rain.

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,393
- Uh-huh.

105
00:03:52,393 --> 00:03:53,671
- Okay. Jamie, other ideas?

106
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:57,939
- I think a cloud is, like,

107
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,864
water turning into mist,

108
00:04:00,864 --> 00:04:02,815
and it gathers in the cloud.

109
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:03,813
So, when it gets dark,

110
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,901
it builds up with more water,

111
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:09,130
and then when it rains, all the,

112
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,661
the cloud gets too heavy with water,

113
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:13,187
and then it rains.

114
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,882
- Okay, so it's a mist.

115
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:15,555
- Yeah.

116
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,157
- Is it a liquid or a gas?

117
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:20,385
- A liquid slash,

118
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,080
a liquid slash gas.

119
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,448
- Okay, a little of both? Okay.

120
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:26,886
Okay, alright. Let's move on.

121
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:27,885
How about E?

122
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:31,692
It changed into a new substance.

123
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:35,779
No takers for E, new substance.

124
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:39,773
Okay. How about F, it went to the sun?

125
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:43,273
It went up to the sun.

126
00:04:45,043 --> 00:04:47,551
No takers for F either?

127
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,641
There's a lot of hands I'm not seeing up.

128
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:50,662
How about G?

129
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:52,111
It broke down into atoms

130
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:56,285
of hydrogen and oxygen.

131
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,706
Alex?

132
00:04:57,706 --> 00:05:00,098
- I said that because, well,

133
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:01,863
it goes up into the sky,

134
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:04,811
and it must be really
humid because it like,

135
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:08,747
I can't remember, is it
when the atoms separate,

136
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:13,716
or, and because we're humidity-ing it?

137
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:14,691
Yeah.

138
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:15,922
- Okay, so it becomes more humid,

139
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:18,221
and that makes the atoms separate?

140
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,103
Is that what you're saying?

141
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:20,473
- Well, not exactly.

142
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:22,470
It's hard to find the words.

143
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,931
- Okay. Can you try?

144
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:28,083
It separates and that's
what makes it humid?

145
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:31,357
- Well, I don't know, I guess.

146
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,403
- I'll come back to you.
Keep thinking about it.

147
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:36,495
How could you explain your ideas?

148
00:05:36,495 --> 00:05:37,910
Joey, what are your ideas?

149
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,277
- I, can I go off of Alex?

150
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:41,951
- Yeah.

151
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,712
- Oh, so when hot air rises,

152
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,520
so when the water gets
to a certain temperature,

153
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,422
I forgot who said that, but it,

154
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:56,064
the atoms spread apart

155
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,432
and change into a gas.

156
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,313
And it would be more humid

157
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:03,541
because hot air rises and the gas rises

158
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,516
into the clouds.

159
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:05,723
- Okay, so as the hot air rises,

160
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:07,999
the gas rises with it?

161
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:08,742
Is that what you're saying?

162
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:09,276
- Mmhm.

163
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:10,529
- Okay.

164
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,871
And the water becomes hydrogen

165
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,752
and oxygen as it goes up?

166
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:17,426
- Mmhm.

167
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:18,773
- Okay. Other ideas?

168
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:19,515
Dylan?

169
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,953
- Well, so, there's oxygen and hydrogen

170
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:23,346
in the atmosphere,

171
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:25,250
and the atmosphere is gas,

172
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,433
and gas doesn't sit at the bottom.

173
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:28,872
It's in the air,

174
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:31,845
which means it's obviously
floating, I guess.

175
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:35,420
And so if water turns into vapor,

176
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,301
which I think most of us know,

177
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,810
and vapor can float,

178
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,784
and obviously it's turning into a gas,

179
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,990
like oxygen and hydrogen.

180
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,219
And so how would water be able to float

181
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,841
if it's turning into gases,

182
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,952
it's breaking down into
atoms of hydrogen and oxygen?

183
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:55,110
It's still almost like a liquid gas,

184
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,498
but if it wasn't a gas
that consists of things

185
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:00,659
like hydrogen and oxygen,

186
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:01,542
how would it be able to float?

187
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,190
How would it be able to turn to clouds?

188
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,278
- Okay, so it can't be water still

189
00:07:06,278 --> 00:07:07,648
if it's going to be floating
around in the air.

190
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,182
- Well, yeah.
- Is that what you're saying?

191
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,363
- It's still water, but
it's in a different form,

192
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:15,953
that it has components that make up,

193
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:18,863
it's pretty much a liquid gas, almost.

194
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:19,838
- It's a liquid gas.

195
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:20,767
- Yes, yeah.

196
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,369
- Which makes it float in the air.

197
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:23,484
- Well, yeah, gas.

198
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,804
Gas can float, and hydrogen and oxygen.

199
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:27,895
- Okay.

200
00:07:27,895 --> 00:07:32,394
- So, it becomes hydrogen
and oxygen in the air?

201
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:36,463
- Well, as it heats up, then it breaks,

202
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:40,201
because as it heats up,
then it creates vapor.

203
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,568
Water evaporates, and so as it heats up,

204
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,170
when it gets to that
point, then it breaks down

205
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,679
into atoms and everything else.

206
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,910
- Okay, when it gets to the air.

207
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,187
- Yeah, when it turns into vapor.

208
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,673
- Okay, when it turns into vapor,

209
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:51,857
that's when it becomes hydrogen.

210
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:53,947
- Because yeah, that's how it,

211
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:56,594
when the atoms of hydrogen
and oxygen break down,

212
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:59,102
I'm guessing that that means that

213
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:00,750
that's when it's turning into vapor.

214
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,451
- Okay. Okay, okay, great.

215
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,347
Luke, other ideas?

216
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:08,366
- I think it might become
the combination of the two,

217
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:12,777
because I think more than just one,

218
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:15,982
because I think it does
split into different atoms,

219
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:18,536
which makes it a gas.

220
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:21,392
And then, um,

221
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:25,014
and then also it could go into the clouds,

222
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:29,379
or something like in
other parts of the answer.

223
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,467
- Okay, so maybe it turns
into this hydrogen and oxygen gas,

224
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:33,814
but then goes to the clouds.

225
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,763
- Yeah, because I think
that that's kind of

226
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,899
the only way to go to the clouds,

227
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,778
and I think its probable
that it would, so...

228
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:44,262
- Okay. Okay, okay.

229
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,190
Lots of different ideas.

230
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,112
We're going to move on so that
we can get to the others.

231
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,364
How could we observe this?

232
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,850
What could we do to know if

233
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,588
some of these options
are the right option,

234
00:08:56,588 --> 00:09:00,535
or be able to eliminate
them as possible options?

235
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:02,439
What could we do?

236
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,995
Turn and talk to your partner, quickly.

237
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:05,853
What could we observe?

238
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:19,748
(class chattering)

239
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,711
And see what happens? Okay.

240
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:24,590
Would we be able to eliminate any of these

241
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,446
if we agreed with Owen's suggestion?

242
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:30,906
(class chatters)

243
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:33,205
Eliminate F? How come?

244
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,991
- Because the sun's very far away.

245
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:36,827
- Okay.

246
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,474
- And it's really, really hot, so.

247
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,890
- Okay, if we did it in the classroom,

248
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,560
would it be able to get to the sun?

249
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,627
No, it'd be stuck in the classroom, right?

250
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:46,509
Okay.

251
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,552
Are there others that we
might be able to eliminate

252
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:50,340
if we did that?

253
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,616
(class chattering)

254
00:09:52,616 --> 00:09:55,055
Good.

255
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:58,624
Okay, let's hear your ideas.

256
00:09:58,653 --> 00:09:59,628
What could we do?

257
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:04,498
How could we observe this scenario?

258
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:06,106
- Trenton, I haven't heard from you today.

259
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,264
- Okay, so to eliminate some of them,

260
00:10:09,264 --> 00:10:11,632
if soaked into the ground,

261
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:14,906
you could check if the
ground was wet or anything,

262
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,670
and it moved up to the clouds.

263
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,294
You could check if there's any clouds.

264
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:21,036
- Okay. See if a cloud forms.

265
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,381
Okay, Miley, other ideas?

266
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,774
- I agree with Trenton, but I think

267
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:27,653
I've seen them where
the area's curved over,

268
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:29,511
like our roof, and the sun is out,

269
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:33,853
you can see mist kind of stuff coming out.

270
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,803
And I think if we did that,

271
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,869
then maybe we could observe something

272
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:38,821
that could be useful.

273
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:41,422
- Okay, what would we have to do, though,

274
00:10:41,422 --> 00:10:42,978
to set this up?

275
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:44,324
What do we need? Owen.

276
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,530
- You can wet a paper towel

277
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,993
and then hang it from somewhere

278
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:50,802
and then heat it by a light, and then,

279
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:53,101
or you could have a fan.

280
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,935
- Okay, heat it with a light or a fan.

281
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:57,907
So, perfect. I like your idea.

282
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:02,157
So, we have a cloth. It's wet.

283
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:05,587
Is it wet?

284
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:06,332
- Kind of.

285
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,260
- Kind of? It's not wet enough?

286
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,304
Should we make it a little more wet?

287
00:11:09,304 --> 00:11:10,071
- Yeah.

288
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:12,921
- Okay, let me make it a little more wet.

289
00:11:15,434 --> 00:11:17,152
That better?

290
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:18,499
- Yeah.
- Okay.

291
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,236
And in this scenario, this
is hanging outside, right?

292
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,971
Well, we're going to hang
it in our classroom.

293
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:29,497
And

294
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:33,445
since we don't have a lot of sun today,

295
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:37,735
we're going to make our own light energy

296
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:41,339
with this lamp.

297
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,150
So, don't look at the lightbulb

298
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,659
because it's real bright.

299
00:11:44,659 --> 00:11:45,588
There we go.

300
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,699
And we're going to set it up here.

301
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,973
So as we watch this,

302
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:54,852
which one of these, or which ones,

303
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:57,244
might we be able to eliminate?

304
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:58,893
So as we observe,

305
00:11:58,893 --> 00:12:01,052
what can we, how will we know

306
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:05,296
which ones are true or not true?

307
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:08,041
Let me give you a minute to think.

308
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,223
I want to hear from someone new

309
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:11,756
I haven't heard from yet.

310
00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:13,544
Who haven't I heard from yet?

311
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:14,798
Augustine.

312
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:18,211
- A, because I wasn't sure if the ground

313
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,952
was wet or dry.

314
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:20,811
- Perfect, yeah.

315
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:21,995
It can't soak into the ground, right?

316
00:12:21,995 --> 00:12:24,433
So, we'll see if the counter is wet,

317
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,246
if there's a puddle there,

318
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,847
then we'll know that A
is the correct answer.

319
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:28,915
Excellent.

320
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:33,233
Others that we might be able to eliminate

321
00:12:33,233 --> 00:12:34,325
just by observing?

322
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,486
Jake.

323
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,668
- B, it disappears and no longer exists,

324
00:12:37,668 --> 00:12:40,756
because nothing can't disappear.

325
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:41,825
Something can't disappear

326
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,403
unless it goes into a black hole.

327
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,493
- Okay, will we be able
to observe that, though?

328
00:12:45,493 --> 00:12:46,213
- No.

329
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,118
- Not really, yeah.

330
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:48,117
So, that one might be tricky,

331
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:50,508
but that's good prior knowledge.

332
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:53,388
Jamie, others that we
might be able to eliminate?

333
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:56,476
- We can tell if

334
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,542
it moved up to the clouds,
because there's no way

335
00:12:58,542 --> 00:12:59,750
it can move up to the clouds

336
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,328
because there's a ceiling.

337
00:13:01,328 --> 00:13:02,257
- Yeah, there's a ceiling.

338
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:05,415
Well, so if we saw a cloud
forming in our classroom,

339
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:09,316
right, then we'd know
that it makes a cloud.

340
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:10,616
But if we don't see a cloud,

341
00:13:10,616 --> 00:13:12,984
then we'll know that we
can eliminate that one.

342
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,261
That one's wrong. Good.

343
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,583
Others that we can eliminate? Miley?

344
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,393
- F, it went up to the
sun, because it can't,

345
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:22,986
we don't have a sun in the classroom.

346
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,541
- If we saw it, right,
gathering up the light,

347
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,095
right, that might tell
us that maybe F is true.

348
00:13:31,095 --> 00:13:33,070
But it can't get to the sun

349
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,299
because it's stuck in our classroom.

350
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,112
Good.

351
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:37,922
Any others that we might
be able to eliminate?

352
00:13:37,922 --> 00:13:39,292
Emmie?

353
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:43,192
- We might be able to, well, C,

354
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:46,397
because if the cloud isn't wet anymore,

355
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:51,083
and you can't see anything

356
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,383
or feel anything,

357
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,682
we would know that that's true.

358
00:13:54,682 --> 00:13:55,797
- Okay, okay.

359
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:59,000
So, if it disappears, we
can't see it or feel it

360
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,508
in the cloth, but we can't
see it anywhere else,

361
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,178
maybe we'll know that C is more likely.

362
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,498
Okay, good. Very good.

363
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:07,448
Excellent.

364
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,886
So, we're going to keep
observing for these things.

365
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:11,697
Those are the things that
we want to keep an eye out,

366
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,090
look for a cloud forming,

367
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,109
look for water puddling at the bottom,

368
00:14:16,109 --> 00:14:19,267
look for water gathering at the light.

369
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:22,332
See if it chemically changed
into a new substance,

370
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:24,445
we might be able to see it, right,

371
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:25,652
in our classroom somewhere.

372
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:29,297
So, we'll be observing for that.

373
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:30,876
Is it going to happen immediately?

374
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:31,642
- No.

375
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:32,966
- No, so we'll have to
come back to this one.

376
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,684
Keep looking back as we go.

377
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:37,772
In the meantime, uh-oh.

378
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:40,042
No, here we go.

379
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:41,928
We'll go to the next one, next scenario.

380
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,809
What's in the bubbles?

381
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:46,410
So, turn to that scenario in your notebook

382
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,942
if you're not there right now.

383
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:49,312
What's in the bubbles?

384
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:51,471
So, Hannah is boiling water

385
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,654
in a glass teakettle.

386
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:54,861
She notices bubbles forming

387
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,974
on the bottom of the kettle
that rise to the top,

388
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:00,829
and wonders, "What is in the bubbles?"

389
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:02,361
She asks her family what they think.

390
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,381
This is what they say.

391
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:08,352
So, who agrees with Dad?

392
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:11,393
Who may agree with Dad?

393
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,065
Owen.

394
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,687
- Well, since it's being heated,

395
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:18,963
and being heated from the bottom,

396
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:21,656
the bubbles will form
on the bottom as heat,

397
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:24,466
and then the heat would
make it rise to the top.

398
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,743
- Okay, the heat makes it rise to the top.

399
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:27,376
Good. Other ideas?

400
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,318
Other people who agree with Dad?

401
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:30,224
Mitch?

402
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:32,998
- Well, I agree with Dad and Calvin.

403
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:33,998
- Okay.

404
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:36,464
- And for Dad, if the bubbles are heat,

405
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:40,226
maybe the heat forms the bubbles

406
00:15:40,226 --> 00:15:43,778
and then the oxygen in the bubbles

407
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:45,380
makes it float to the top.

408
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,888
- Okay, okay.

409
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:49,421
So, let's move on to Calvin then.

410
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,488
Other thoughts about Calvin.

411
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:55,365
Who agrees, the bubbles
are filled with air?

412
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:58,378
Reed?

413
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,812
- I forgot.

414
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,927
- Okay, we'll come back to you.

415
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,110
- Anybody else agree with Calvin?

416
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,377
Anyone I haven't heard from yet today?

417
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:15,956
No? Trenton, anything
for you to contribute?

418
00:16:15,956 --> 00:16:18,301
- Well, I didn't at first,

419
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:20,716
and I don't really know if I do still,

420
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:24,547
but like I kind of do,
because with the water,

421
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:26,985
all water has oxygen in it,

422
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,029
which is kind of like air,

423
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,210
and then the air could be in the bubbles

424
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,949
because the bubbles would probably heat up

425
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,550
and be at the bottom, and
then the air would fill up

426
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,384
from the water and go into the bubbles,

427
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:41,288
and then (muttering).

428
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,471
- Okay, so there's air in the water,

429
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:46,373
and as it heats up, it
comes out of the water.

430
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,208
Okay, other ideas? Miley?

431
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,717
- I agree with Trenton and Mitch,

432
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,014
because they could be
both filled with air,

433
00:16:53,014 --> 00:16:54,825
but they could be hot,

434
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,960
because it's where the source of heat is.

435
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,306
- Okay, alright.

436
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:00,723
Reed, did you remember?

437
00:17:00,723 --> 00:17:02,255
- Yes.
- Okay, go ahead.

438
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:06,551
- Well, the heat can take the air

439
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:07,874
out of the water.

440
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:09,337
- The heat would take
the air out of the water,

441
00:17:09,337 --> 00:17:10,080
like Trenton was saying.

442
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,123
- And since air's lighter than water,

443
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:13,307
it would rise to the top.

444
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:14,213
- It goes to the top.

445
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,049
Okay, good.

446
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,581
How about Grandma?

447
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:20,157
The bubbles are an
invisible form of water.

448
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:22,711
Anyone agree with Grandma?

449
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:25,353
Rupo.

450
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:27,347
- I said I believe with Grandma

451
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:31,944
because I thought that they'd go up

452
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:35,126
to the top.

453
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:36,449
I thought it was just invisible because

454
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:37,354
I thought it was just going up,

455
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:39,351
and the cloud's just evaporating

456
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,907
higher and higher.

457
00:17:40,907 --> 00:17:41,905
- Okay, so there are,

458
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,856
the bubbles are evaporated water.

459
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,179
(coughing)

460
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:46,201
And then go away.

461
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,803
Okay. Matthew?

462
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:50,473
- Well, it had to be a form of water,

463
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:54,095
because it came from water, I guess,

464
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:58,762
and they're invisible, so yeah.

465
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:00,898
- Okay, so it had to be water

466
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:01,990
because it's coming from water,

467
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,360
and you can't see it, so it's invisible.

468
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,800
- Uh-huh.
- Great.

469
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,169
How about Mom?

470
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,955
The bubbles are empty,
there's nothing inside them.

471
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,556
Who agrees with Mom? Who agrees with Mom?

472
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:12,601
Jonathan?

473
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:16,060
- I think that there's
nothing inside the bubbles

474
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,638
because how could anything
get in the bubbles

475
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:20,844
in the first place?

476
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:23,096
How could that turn into bubbles?

477
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:24,698
- Okay, how could anything be in there?

478
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:25,743
Where would it have come from?

479
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:27,136
- Yeah.
- Okay.

480
00:18:27,136 --> 00:18:30,015
Anybody else agree with Mom?

481
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,292
Anybody else agree with Mom?

482
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,221
Okay, how about Lucy?

483
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,427
The bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen

484
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:37,933
that separated from the water.

485
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,094
Lots of hands.

486
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:41,392
Who haven't I heard from today?

487
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:44,388
Jodie.

488
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:46,152
- Well, I don't really know why,

489
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:48,594
because it just sounded more scientific.

490
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,594
(laughing)

491
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:54,268
- Sounds more scientific. Okay.

492
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,846
Any other reasons?

493
00:18:56,846 --> 00:19:01,605
- No.

494
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:03,184
- No? Alright.

495
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,341
Kyle, can you add on to that?

496
00:19:06,341 --> 00:19:09,333
- I think in the water, when it's not hot,

497
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,260
that there's oxygen and hydrogen

498
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,862
and other things in it,

499
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,140
and then when it heats up,

500
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,528
it forms into, I don't know.

501
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:19,967
It rises up.

502
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:24,077
- Okay, so where did the
oxygen and hydrogen come from?

503
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,283
- I think it's part of the water.

504
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:29,557
- It's part of the water. Okay.

505
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:30,880
Good. Emmie?

506
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,518
- Well, I know that,

507
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,845
I'm pretty sure water is made of

508
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:38,910
two oxygen molecules and
one hydrogen molecule.

509
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,885
- Opposite.

510
00:19:39,885 --> 00:19:40,791
- Oh, other way around.

511
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,463
- Yup, two hydrogens and one oxygen.

512
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,206
You're right.

513
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:47,060
- Okay, and I'm with Lucy

514
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,987
because bubbles usually kind of

515
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,971
probably form by the water, and inside,

516
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:56,106
and since the water's (muttering)

517
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:59,213
the molecules, that
that's what's happening.

518
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,309
- Okay, so water--
