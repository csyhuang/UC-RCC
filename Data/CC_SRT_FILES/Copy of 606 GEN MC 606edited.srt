1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Background chatter]

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,630
- Okay, so put these where
they need to go on the board.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,544
And Liz, your job is graphing.

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,965
So, Harper tell me about your data.

5
00:00:14,979 --> 00:00:16,836
You, your plant is...

6
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:18,067
- 20 centimeters.

7
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,390
- [Teacher] Okay, and it's grown...

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,551
- 11 centimeters.

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,514
- [Teacher] Wow, that's a
lot of growth, isn't it?

10
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:23,675
Good job.

11
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,705
And, Emma, what's your job?

12
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:28,829
You were the recorder.

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,755
And so, some of the observations...

14
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:33,601
- [Emma] The leaves are bigger.

15
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,435
It has grown bigger.

16
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,961
In the middle of the leaves
there are tiny leaves.

17
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,240
- [Teacher] Cool, in the middle of

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,796
the leaves, there's tiny leaves.

19
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:43,278
That is interesting.

20
00:00:43,278 --> 00:00:46,721
And your cotyledon has come off.

21
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,965
Okay, so that's good.

22
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,119
Excellent.

23
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,034
Okay, so Coby, you're
going to be using the board

24
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:54,915
and putting your data up there.

25
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:58,730
So, tell me how high, how
tall is your plant now?

26
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,684
- [Group] 20 centimeters.

27
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:01,678
20 centimeters.

28
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:03,277
Okay, let's go check your graph.

29
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:05,042
- [Student] We're out of room.

30
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:06,841
- [Teacher] I have more.

31
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,035
So next time, you'll have a graph that

32
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,199
will be, take two of this,

33
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,912
and it will be 40 centimeters.

34
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:16,477
Because 20 plus 20 is 40.

35
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:19,310
So, here's your 20 centimeter line,

36
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,091
what needs to go down here?

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,871
Okay, now remember to help Parker

38
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,224
with observations.

39
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:35,028
(background chatter)

40
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:38,638
- Natalie does the board.

41
00:01:38,638 --> 00:01:40,040
Oh, Natalie, go up there.

42
00:01:40,040 --> 00:02:01,608
(background chatter)

43
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,606
- [Teacher] Okay, girls,
let's talk about what

44
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,998
your findings are, because, just a second.

45
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:10,275
Talk to me about what happened

46
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,518
with your plant.

47
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:14,118
(students all talking at once)

48
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:16,330
- Let's take a look.

49
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,875
So, what do you think has,

50
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,441
is the reason for it not changing?

51
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:25,357
It was 10 centimeters when you started.

52
00:02:25,357 --> 00:02:28,950
It was 10 centimeters again on Monday.

53
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,974
(classroom noise drowns out student)

54
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,144
Okay, but that's okay because we know the

55
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:37,118
cotyledon was for germination.

56
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:39,231
It's done with that now, and it can grow

57
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,914
without it.

58
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:45,251
(classroom noise drowns out students.)

59
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:47,909
- [Teacher] Is it a growing plant?

60
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:48,837
Looking at your graph.

61
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:51,409
Is it growing?

62
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:55,351
So, maybe the leaves
will get bigger and then,

63
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,637
- The roots will get bigger, too.

64
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:59,801
- [Teacher] the roots will get bigger.

65
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,276
The water and the nutrients.

66
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:08,354
Okay, let's take a look
at your observations.

67
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,396
Roots longer, white
root, cotyledon fell off,

68
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,505
leaves are pointy, bigger leaves.

69
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:16,004
Now, what did we observe about the growth?

70
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:20,758
About the growth of the plant?

71
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:23,275
What did we observe about it?

72
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:24,401
I think we should include that

73
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,642
in your observations.

74
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:31,129
Okay, so observer should record that.

75
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:34,547
Okay, boys and girls, I need

76
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,971
all board job people to come on up here.

77
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:52,638
Okay, now you guys, one at a time,

78
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:54,391
are going to fill in your data.

79
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:58,277
Make sure that you're
choosing a new color.

80
00:03:58,277 --> 00:03:59,917
And I'm going to make sure that these

81
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:01,078
have seen all of your,

82
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:04,486
I don't think I've heard
about your growth here.

83
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,463
Okay, tell me about
what happened (mumbles).

84
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,767
Joshua, you need to go sit
down, work on the math.

85
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,274
You're not ready for that yet?

86
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:18,549
Okay, so talk to your group and see

87
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,560
what you need to do next.

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,231
Okay, so tell me about what has..

89
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,547
(classroom noise drowns out teacher).

90
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:29,155
(multiple students talking)

91
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:33,752
How about the growth?

92
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:37,557
Right now it is, okay, so Alex...

93
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:39,931
Yes, go get some.

94
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:45,925
Now, your plant has,

95
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,595
it's 12 centimeters now, it started at...

96
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:52,789
So, how much total growth has...

97
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,941
(classroom noise drowns out teacher)

98
00:04:55,941 --> 00:05:00,660
(multiple students talking)

99
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,928
Okay, so it started at
the 10 and now it's a 12.

100
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,426
So, can we make that, who's the recorder?

101
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:10,798
So, we want to make that,

102
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:14,682
because this is how much is it growing.

103
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,157
Okay, so it's growing,

104
00:05:19,157 --> 00:05:21,024
and let's look at our graph.

105
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:23,081
You've got your day, and now...

106
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:27,284
Oh, so you went up a
little bit too high here.

107
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,786
(classroom noise drowns out teacher)

108
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:36,921
(multiple students talking)

109
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:42,591
Let's take a pencil,
Alex, and just do a small

110
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:44,681
X right there, so that
we know that we really

111
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,485
wanted our bar to stop at 12.

112
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:54,996
Maybe more so that we can see it.

113
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,549
Keep erasing it, that's good.

114
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:03,484
(multiple children talking)

115
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:08,597
Don't play with your plant please.

116
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:10,838
If you're all finished,
you should be working on

117
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:11,668
the math problems.

118
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:16,668
(multiple children talking)

119
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,984
Okay, now, let's talk about your plant.

120
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:30,080
Okay, let me come around here.

121
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:36,851
Tell me about your plant.

122
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,467
- It started to get bigger.

123
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,520
The shell was growing out and we, it's

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,520
12, 12 centimeters.

125
00:06:50,834 --> 00:06:53,393
- And how much has it grown total?

126
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,511
- 50.

127
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,931
Oh, five.
- Five, that's right.

128
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,276
You started at seven,
and now you're at 12,

129
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,075
so the difference between

130
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,757
12 and seven is five, right?

131
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,510
That's exactly the same as my plant, too.

132
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,553
What I noticed about yours, is over

133
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,910
the week, it came out of, like you said,

134
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,671
the seed cover came off, and the leaves...

135
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,912
- Started to peel and it started to break.

136
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:17,073
- Yeah.

137
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, so the stem is really long.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,834
Let's put this up here.

139
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,406
The leaves are bigger.

140
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,035
Who is the observer?

141
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:28,624
You are, okay.

142
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:34,312
And, can we see something
about the seed cover?

143
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:35,718
Okay, so while he's doing that, we need

144
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:38,441
to do some important things here.

145
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:41,144
What about the date?

146
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:46,854
(multiple children talking)

147
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:52,489
One 30 goes here, because that was Monday.

148
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:56,563
One slash 30.

149
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:11,365
(classroom noise drowns out teacher)

150
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,766
Okay, and today's date is...

151
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:28,462
Okay, and that's it, because today's the

152
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:30,111
third and this bar shows...

153
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,667
Natalie go sit down.

154
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:35,005
This bar shows that...

155
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:41,289
Good job you guys, and
you've got that added.

156
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,510
And let's make sure that we're gentle

157
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,749
with that measuring.

158
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,396
You can work on it together.

159
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,480
Molly, stay with your group.

160
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:59,617
(multiple students talking at once)

161
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:05,903
You guys work on that together.

162
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:09,644
You guys can work on it together.

163
00:09:13,582 --> 00:10:18,076
(multiple students talking at once)

164
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,553
So, you guys have had,

165
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:30,877
what's the most common number

166
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,284
of seeds they found?

167
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,054
- [Group] Five.

168
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,632
- Five, good.

169
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,200
How about the total number of seeds?

170
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,004
Now do we know, is each dot worth one?

171
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,076
Okay, so what's the total number of seeds?

172
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:48,996
(students talking)

173
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:55,722
So how many seeds in all?

174
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:04,156
Okay, boys and girls,
Sophia's finishing up.

175
00:11:04,156 --> 00:11:07,558
If you have math extension
problems in your

176
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:11,800
table group, please put those to the side.

177
00:11:11,952 --> 00:11:16,823
And I'm going to ask Chloe's group and

178
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:21,037
Angel's group, and
Derek's group to come and

179
00:11:21,037 --> 00:11:22,512
have a seat here on the carpet so

180
00:11:22,512 --> 00:11:24,410
we're close to our graph.

181
00:11:27,237 --> 00:11:29,037
You do not need to bring anything with you

182
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:32,004
because we have it all up here already.

183
00:11:35,596 --> 00:11:38,563
Chloe come join us, please.

184
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:52,590
Alright, Ashton, and Josiah
you can move closer,

185
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,243
so you can see,
or you can stay there.

186
00:11:58,283 --> 00:11:59,969
Coby and Isaiah please come join us.

187
00:12:10,343 --> 00:12:11,997
Alright.

188
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:17,591
Now one last person needs to fill

189
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:19,235
in her data.

190
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,236
Let's see, that would be me, and my

191
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:27,476
height was 16.

192
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:29,031
Okay, so while I'm doing that,

193
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:31,516
take a look at the graph we just built.

194
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:32,921
And think about what are some things

195
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,028
that you notice about the graph?

196
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:37,713
What do you see?

197
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:39,791
What are some things in common?

198
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,967
What are some things that are different?

199
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:56,080
Turn to your neighbor
and tell them one thing

200
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,408
that you noticed about the graph.

201
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:24,600
(children talking over each other)

202
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:31,471
Okay, eyes on me.

203
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:32,876
Now you tell me, what are some things

204
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:35,403
that you noticed about the graph, Alex?

205
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:38,753
- [Alex] That six and three
has the same height as us.

206
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:41,400
Okay, so group six and three, and

207
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,503
you are group?

208
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:43,559
- [Alex] Five.

209
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,593
- Five, all have the height of,

210
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,285
all the way across, and it's...

211
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:51,736
- [Alex] 10, 12.

212
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:55,078
12, and what's our unit?

213
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:56,190
Centimeters.

214
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,560
That's right, so we have three groups

215
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,592
that have the same height.

216
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:00,718
12 centimeters.

217
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,193
Ashton, what did you notice?

218
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,474
- [Ashton] So, group one, four, and

219
00:14:04,474 --> 00:14:09,154
your group, eight,
they're all not matching.

220
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:12,344
But all the other ones have a match.

221
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,319
So group eight,

222
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,860
and one and four are separate.

223
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,799
They don't have someone who's

224
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,064
kind of similar.

225
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:24,305
So, that leads me to ask about groups two

226
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:27,320
and seven, tell me about them, Blake.

227
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,866
- [Blake] Seven and two are the same.

228
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,514
- Seven and two are the same, they both

229
00:14:30,514 --> 00:14:32,360
are the same, why Keith?

230
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,671
- [Keith] Because they both have 20.

231
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:35,681
- 20?

232
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,760
- [Keith] Centimeters.

233
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,991
20 centimeters, that's right.

234
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:42,804
So, what group on there
has the smallest plant?

235
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,667
Alfredo, what group on there has the

236
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,560
smallest plant?

237
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,500
Group four.

238
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,991
Toby, and how tall is group four's plant?

239
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,233
- [Toby] Ten centimeters.

240
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:53,638
Ten centimeters, that's right.

241
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:55,309
Now, group four, Molly, tell us a little

242
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:58,320
bit about what happened with your plant.
