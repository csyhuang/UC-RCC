1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,271
- Counting on that.

2
00:00:01,271 --> 00:00:03,541
I agree with AJ, but also I think that...

3
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:05,389
What I want to say is that

4
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:06,658
it kind of adds a lot more risk

5
00:00:06,658 --> 00:00:08,349
when they get rid of the space shuttle

6
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,603
because kind of like what AJ was saying,

7
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:12,443
it's good to have a backup

8
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:13,883
just in case you want it.

9
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,063
And we still do need to go

10
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:16,203
up to space every now and again

11
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:18,283
if we want to maintain stuff up there.

12
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:19,343
So we know that,

13
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:21,563
so we're having other people work with it,

14
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,933
but the problem is,

15
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,523
is that actually adds more risk

16
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:25,643
because now we have to deal

17
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,843
with the fact that,

18
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,003
"What if they messed up?

19
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,463
"What if they blow up

20
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,133
"or do something wrong?"

21
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,903
And if they're not as stringent

22
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:34,403
on safety standards as we are

23
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,063
then there's gonna be a lot more problems

24
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:39,723
and if it's not able to do the same things

25
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:41,513
that's going to be completely bad, too.

26
00:00:41,723 --> 00:00:44,335
- Okay, Eric said, "Go up to fix things."

27
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,335
What would be some things

28
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,895
that we would need to make sure

29
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:49,045
that we're going up to maintain in space?

30
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:50,080
Just to kind of follow up.

31
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,800
- [Girl] International Space Station.

32
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,210
- Okay, International Space Station.

33
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,460
- Some of the satellites we have in orbit.

34
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,720
- Okay, satellites that do what for us?

35
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,807
- Television and communication.

36
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:02,707
- Okay.

37
00:01:02,707 --> 00:01:04,847
- Ms. McCall, what's that one with the sun

38
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,157
that is predicting the sun flares?

39
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:11,501
- [Teacher] You can just write Sun Probe.

40
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:12,771
- Sun probe.
- [Teacher] That's fine.

41
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,511
Excuse me while I turn this on.

42
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,611
- [Eric] And the Hubble.

43
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,471
- Hubble's gone a lot longer
than they expected it to,

44
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:23,881
so if it breaks, we'd want to repair it.

45
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:25,821
- Especially since we
don't have a new one.

46
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:26,891
- Alana.

47
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:27,804
- I know how Mer

48
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,136
was talking about the risks,

49
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:31,296
like with the Challenger

50
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:33,316
and that was really devastating,

51
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:34,856
but I remember the wife

52
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:36,996
whose husband died on Challenger.

53
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,736
She said that he knew the risks.

54
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:40,276
That's part of being an astronaut

55
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:41,576
and being in NASA

56
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:42,546
and willing to go up there

57
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:43,766
and you're risking your life.

58
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:44,897
It's not like they went in there

59
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,497
totally blind about that.

60
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,137
I think that's kind of the price

61
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,377
of gaining so much knowledge

62
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,657
about something so unknown right now.

63
00:01:51,657 --> 00:01:53,737
We have to be able to
risk our lives to get it

64
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,438
and if they have people
willing to do that,

65
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:56,748
I say go for it.

66
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,699
- [Teacher] Okay, Blanca and then Megan.

67
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:02,589
- I get what she's saying

68
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,199
with they risked their lives,

69
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,769
but you're also risking...

70
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,892
the money and time that
everyone has put into it.

71
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,262
They spent all this time
and all this money on

72
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:17,722
these ginormous space things

73
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,362
and to put them up into space.

74
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,672
And like the Challenger

75
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:21,662
it just exploded

76
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:23,262
and they didn't even really get that far

77
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:25,022
just for one minor error.

78
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:28,262
And I don't think they
should cut all the way

79
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:29,402
like they were saying.

80
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:31,822
Have it just when you need it,

81
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:34,202
but it's still a lot of money

82
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:37,062
that our country doesn't
really have right now,

83
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:40,842
so maybe it's not the most important thing

84
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:42,562
and there's other things
that they need to fix

85
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,002
before they can go back

86
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:46,342
to putting more money into that.

87
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,042
- [Teacher] We'll go Megan, then Bieber.

88
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,342
- So, you know how we're paying Russia

89
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:52,422
to fly up to the
International Space Station?

90
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,602
I think what we should
do is have a shuttle

91
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:56,902
and have people pay us to ride up

92
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:59,122
to the space station.

93
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:01,541
Because then we have more funding for NASA

94
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,961
and then we have a shuttle.

95
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,421
Then people know they can get us

96
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,961
instead of giving all this money

97
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:07,901
to Russia to fly up there.

98
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,501
I feel like we should
still have our own shuttle

99
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,821
so that we can fly up, not for free,

100
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,501
but we can fly up with the United States

101
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:17,641
and then have open seats
for other countries

102
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,041
who need to come in.

103
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,461
They can pay us for it

104
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:23,141
and then we get the money.

105
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:26,691
- [Teacher] Okay, Bieber,
you need to sit close.

106
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:28,141
Eli, then we'll go Rachel.

107
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,468
- I don't know what color to show,

108
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:32,188
but Russia's not making a profit

109
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,168
off of us riding up there.

110
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:36,158
They're just trying to cover their costs.

111
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:40,118
It's not like we'll be doing good business

112
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:43,338
ferrying people to the
International Space Station.

113
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:46,398
It's not like a tourist
attraction or anything.

114
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:48,548
It's pretty bland up there.

115
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:52,370
Russia's just trying to pay

116
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,210
to get us up there.

117
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,430
That's the cost of flying somebody there.

118
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,750
They're not making profit out of it.

119
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,031
- [Teacher] Okay, good,
that's a downpoint. Rachel?

120
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,073
- [Rachel] I agree with
what Eli said and also,

121
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,073
people were talking earlier about...

122
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:08,343
jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs.

123
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:09,424
And I think I read somewhere

124
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:12,237
that they created 25,000
jobs or something like that.

125
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:13,537
But if you think about it,

126
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:16,017
if there's 300 million people,

127
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,587
that's still less than
1% of the population.

128
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:20,537
So, while it seems like a big number,

129
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:21,997
it's still not creating as many jobs

130
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:24,412
and we could be creating
other jobs somewhere else.

131
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:25,992
Especially with the economy,

132
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:27,612
so we could be spending the money

133
00:04:27,612 --> 00:04:28,832
that we would be spending on NASA

134
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,392
on something else to
help boost our economy

135
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:32,012
before we start focusing more on NASA

136
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,792
and spending billions of dollars.

137
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:35,592
- [Teacher] Amber, then Clark.

138
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:37,052
- I was going to say I kind of agree with that

139
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:39,672
because our economy is so bad right now.

140
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:41,792
Any kind of job that is offered

141
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:44,012
will be really good for us right now,

142
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,532
at this point in time.

143
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:47,752
So, I don't think cutting the funding

144
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,252
for it would be a really
smart idea because

145
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,312
that's also putting a lot
of people out of work.

146
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:54,473
- [Teacher] Clark.

147
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:59,043
- The statistics with the jobs created

148
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,923
are probably from when NASA

149
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:03,033
was being used a lot

150
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,293
and now that it's been cut down already

151
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,413
all those jobs have already been cut.

152
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:09,713
And I don't think in this economy,

153
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:12,813
people need jobs requiring
that much education...

154
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,034
not everybody has that kind of education

155
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:18,224
to have a job like that.

156
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:20,714
People just need regular jobs in general.

157
00:05:21,774 --> 00:05:23,114
- So, you're saying their employment

158
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,554
would be kind of geared towards

159
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:27,584
upper level educated
as opposed to maybe...

160
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,955
- And like in science and stuff

161
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,335
and not everybody has that.

162
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:32,945
- That's a downpoint. Luis.

163
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:35,455
- Going back to the billions of dollars

164
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:37,875
that are wasted or could
be used for better things,

165
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,415
I found out that the funding for NASA

166
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,795
only accounts for 0.7%

167
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:45,375
of the US government spending.

168
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:48,655
I feel like if you just cut all of that,

169
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:49,735
that's not really going to make

170
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,055
a huge difference when the government's

171
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:54,845
spending 99.3% on other things.

172
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,326
- [Teacher] We'll go Hallie, then Troy.

173
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,567
- Going back to the risk

174
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:01,967
of sending people out into space,

175
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:03,926
I researched and...

176
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,436
I found out that

177
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:09,007
the risk of manned space flights

178
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,286
are actually increasing because

179
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,606
the budget cuts have already happened.

180
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:16,336
As we're pushing for more
people and more money,

181
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,386
we're actually hurting ourselves more

182
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,666
because the safety and
quality assurance programs

183
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,006
have been trimmed back.

184
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,586
The risk is just becoming more and more.

185
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,066
- That's an interesting point.

186
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:27,126
As we're slowly cutting back

187
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:28,836
on the budgets already,

188
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,526
we're automatically increasing that risk

189
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:32,666
because of those budget cuts.

190
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:33,466
Troy?

191
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:34,946
- I actually support...

192
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,956
them cutting the budget because...

193
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,826
for one, when they cut budget,

194
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,256
they're setting aside money to...

195
00:06:43,976 --> 00:06:47,006
buy more space exploration
from private companies.

196
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,826
Those people are more likely

197
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,366
to employ more employees
than the government,

198
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,793
which also stimulates
the economy a lot more.

199
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:55,853
I mean, if everybody's employed

200
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:56,943
by the government,

201
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:58,493
like what could happen to Greece.

202
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,933
- Okay, Shannon hasn't spoken, Bieber.

203
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,313
- Kind of off of what Holly said

204
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:06,353
with the risk and everything going up,

205
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:09,833
I did a little research and with NASA,

206
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,993
there was only a 4.1% fatality rate.

207
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:16,073
Out of something like 439 astronauts,

208
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,833
there have only been 18 deaths.

209
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,293
I feel like there are other jobs

210
00:07:20,293 --> 00:07:22,013
with a higher fatality rate

211
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:23,553
than being an astronaut.

212
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:26,193
- Okay, so even with the budget cuts,

213
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:28,773
we're not seeing this huge increase...

214
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:32,533
Jillian.

215
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,013
- A lot of people are
making the points that

216
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:37,113
it's only affecting the people

217
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:38,733
that are on the space shuttles,

218
00:07:39,103 --> 00:07:40,273
but at the same time,

219
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:42,173
I don't think people realize

220
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,733
the amount of carbon dioxide...

221
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,073
put off by one shuttle launch.

222
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:52,153
It's 28 tons of carbon
dioxide and it's killing...

223
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:56,553
the plants and fish around the site area

224
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:59,473
and it has a lot of
negative effect on everyone,

225
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,833
not just the people in the space shuttle.

226
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:04,573
- So, you're taking the
environmental aspect.

227
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:07,793
Besides looking at costs,

228
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:09,633
besides looking at jobs,

229
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,273
there's this environmental piece

230
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,015
specifically with carbon dioxide.

231
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,255
What is the issue associated

232
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:15,525
with carbon dioxide, Jillian?

233
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,555
- The ozone layer depleted...

234
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,755
and global warming.

235
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:22,145
- Thank you, global warming.

236
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:24,645
Tyler?

237
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:27,246
- To go along with what Luis said,

238
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:31,016
they only get 0.7% of
the national spending,

239
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:34,366
but we also have gained
more knowledge from NASA

240
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,446
than any other government thing.

241
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,506
We can discover

242
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:42,566
maybe how Earth is going to end,

243
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:44,168
and we can discover things

244
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,208
that are more important
than other government,

245
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:49,868
government spending.

246
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:51,578
- So, you're kind of going at the idea

247
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:53,868
that the benefits are outweighing

248
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:54,968
the small amount of cost

249
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,268
when we compare government spending.

250
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:58,559
We'll go Eli, then Justin.

251
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,651
- Also, Luis said it doesn't account

252
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:04,871
for very much of the US budget

253
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:07,531
and if we cut that spending,

254
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,731
it's really not going to go

255
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,591
to anything more productive.

256
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,811
Maybe more guns or something.

257
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:15,951
It's not going to feed the world

258
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:18,841
and buy food for homeless people.

259
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:24,511
It's just going to go to
corporations and wars.

260
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:28,791
And then in regards to CO2 emissions...

261
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,251
does anyone know how much

262
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:36,371
CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year?

263
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,611
Far more than a truck driver.

264
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:41,671
Cows and moose.

265
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:44,201
I think they can flirt over that.

266
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,492
I think that's just moose.

267
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,712
(laughter)

268
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:50,412
- So, you're making the comparison to say

269
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:52,612
the idea that even though
it's a human-made craft,

270
00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:56,112
if we look at natural sources
of the CO2 emission...

271
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:57,753
- And the relative frequency

272
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:00,153
that a moose passes gas.

273
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:03,713
A space shuttle launch doesn't have

274
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:06,013
that big of an effect on the environment.

275
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,023
- Touche.

276
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,943
Anyone have a cup that hasn't spoken yet,

277
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,213
that wants to jump in real quick?

278
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:11,914
Justin.

279
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:13,334
- Going off of what Tyler said,

280
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:14,754
if we stop funding NASA,

281
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:17,294
then we pretty much cut off studying

282
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:19,014
anything outside of our solar system

283
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:21,775
because of the atmosphere of Earth

284
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,655
just doesn't allow us to see that far.

285
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,136
So, it would lessen the chances

286
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,996
of seeing the birth of a star

287
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,356
or the death of a star

288
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:31,296
or where earth might be
heading in the future.

289
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:33,026
- Interesting point.

290
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,496
Amber, then Eric.

291
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:38,356
- Besides everything about the jobs,

292
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:40,876
NASA has created a lot of things

293
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:42,096
that have helped us today,

294
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:43,256
different technologies.

295
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,436
Like in someone's presentation,

296
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:48,416
they were saying something about

297
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:52,016
they're creating lighter
systems for firefighters,

298
00:10:52,746 --> 00:10:54,976
and then cosmetic companies
are even using their stuff.

299
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,916
So, there's a lot of technology

300
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,786
that's been created because of NASA,

301
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:04,216
so I think it's benefited us a lot more

302
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:07,056
than it hasn't helped us.

303
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:09,876
- And so, you're saying those products

304
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:12,196
that have been produced
because of the exploration

305
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,546
are useful to us in our everyday lives.

306
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:18,016
It's not just useful for
exploring many new things.

307
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:19,876
I forgot my order.

308
00:11:19,876 --> 00:11:21,316
Was it Eric on that one?

309
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,716
- I have a couple different connections.

310
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,836
One of them's with the cost.

311
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:32,346
Like they're saying, it's
0.7% of the total budget,

312
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:35,817
but the thing is, not only
is it that low of a cost,

313
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:38,297
it's 14 billion, just to
give you an actual number.

314
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,457
It's 14 billion dollars for
the entire budget of NASA.

315
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:43,877
This year, just for this year alone.

316
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:45,437
To give you a comparison,

317
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:48,017
it's around $640 between $680

318
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,577
for the military budget.

319
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:52,037
That is 47 times more expensive.

320
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:53,557
Now you can say,

321
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:55,019
"Well, alright, that's the military."

322
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,142
The thing is that first of all,

323
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:58,602
it has a lot higher mortality rate.

324
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:00,282
Second of all, it's...

325
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:03,902
a lot less productive in general.

326
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,282
I mean, we're pretty much paying people

327
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:06,632
to kill other people on the planet.

328
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:08,812
I'm sorry, but that's
not very cool in general.

329
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:11,832
For one of those things,

330
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,642
we're trying to get a high fatality rate,

331
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,442
not for our side but the other side.

332
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,022
But the other thing is that
for jobs creations,

333
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,532
if you want to create more jobs

334
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,201
and you're going for a more positive feel,

335
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:28,541
you wouldn't decrease funding for NASA,

336
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,201
you would increase funding.

337
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:31,781
Because, think about it.

338
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:35,401
If you increased it 47
times to the military,

339
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:37,751
I'm pretty sure you'd get
a lot more than one million

340
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,991
even a lot, lot more than

341
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:42,401
just one million jobs from NASA,

342
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,821
if you increased this funding a lot,

343
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:47,421
because imagine whole new planets.

344
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:49,581
Just for environment alone is the fact

345
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:51,642
that we have seven billion
people on this planet,

346
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:52,912
and with seven billion people,

347
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:55,652
we can't hold that many people
very long on this planet.

348
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:57,942
But there are so many
other planets out there,

349
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:00,482
that we could easily fit everyone.

350
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:03,442
There's enough planets
in this entire galaxy

351
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,252
for each person to have their own planet.

352
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,922
That's how many planets there are.

353
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:09,002
- So, you're thinking planning for the future,

354
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:10,932
that it might be beneficial for us.

355
00:13:10,932 --> 00:13:11,782
Holly.

356
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:14,793
- As I was researching,

357
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,353
I found out that there's

358
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:18,773
really no short-term benefits

359
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:20,993
and we're not guaranteed
long-term benefits.

360
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,913
Yes, we are learning about things outside

361
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:26,053
of our solar system and universe,

362
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:30,173
but the main goal of
studying outside the universe

363
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:32,573
is so eventually it could help us.

364
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:36,873
We're not guaranteed to find some new way

365
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:39,914
to cure cancer or to
protect the earth from...

366
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,944
magnetic storms.

367
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:46,034
There might be some way
we can save ourselves,

368
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,924
but we're not guaranteed that.

369
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,494
- So, you're saying the unknown part

370
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,934
of that research kind of plays into 
the factor.

371
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,004
We can keep researching,

372
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,924
but we may never find the answer.

373
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,574
Monique, you got some info?

374
00:13:57,574 --> 00:14:00,364
- Yeah, I think when Hepetiah
said how benefits outweigh

375
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,144
the budget and the risks,

376
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:06,134
we've talked about what was up there.

377
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,507
The benefits are so much longer than

378
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:09,217
what we have in the risk section.

379
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,877
We gain knowledge, we need to study,

380
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:12,137
the sun probe and Hubble

381
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:13,337
and International Space Station.

382
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:16,657
With jobs, it provides
a whole section of jobs,

383
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:19,877
having shuttles go up to space.

384
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,777
Not only that, but they've created

385
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:24,497
new inventions through that,

386
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,257
and I think the inventions
they have created

387
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,937
is really important at
home and in the hospital.

388
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:32,300
Going from there,
there's going to be more.

389
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,460
Not just stopping now.

390
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,920
- So again, tying in the
cost-benefit analysis,

391
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,400
that the benefits are much more

392
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,670
outweighing the costs.

393
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,490
A.J. and then we'll go Alana.

394
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,980
- I guess to counter what Troy said

395
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,500
and what a few people have said,

396
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,720
when they talk about that more jobs

397
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,340
can be created using the money.

398
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,070
It's not just about the economy.

399
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,100
When you think about it,

400
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,700
NASA wasn't meant to
help the economy at all,

401
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,200
and it wasn't meant for job creation,

402
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,440
even though it has
employed so many people.

403
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,160
Through the research that I did,

404
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,580
there was a story from somebody

405
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,360
that's going to be retiring just because

406
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,310
he knows he'd lose his job anyway.

407
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,590
He said that, "After 30
years, this is all I know."

408
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,600
We're losing the most brilliant
minds our country has,

409
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,700
because they just don't
know what else to do.

410
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,060
NASA's been open for decades
and that's their job.

411
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,280
Technicians and analysts,

412
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,761
they're not going to just
become accountants or something.

413
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:32,312
There's nothing after NASA.

414
00:15:33,102 --> 00:15:36,062
That's probably the highest,
most prestigious thing.

415
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:37,942
What do you do after that?

416
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:40,133
It's not like they're just
going to fill minimum wage jobs,

417
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:41,203
which is what most people

418
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:42,963
are looking for right now, anyway,

419
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:45,343
if you're thinking about job creation.

420
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,353
- It's a good point, you have

421
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,563
all these highly educated,

422
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:49,833
specialized people as A.J. points out.

423
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:51,227
Where are they going to go?

424
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:53,197
Are they going to be able to
find jobs within our country?

425
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:54,737
Are they going to go
overseas and then maybe

426
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,197
be helpful and more productive
for other countries?

427
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,217
It's a good point.

428
00:15:58,217 --> 00:15:59,297
Alana, then Troy.

429
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,737
- I know we're talking a lot about

430
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:03,497
the cost-benefit and job creation,

431
00:16:03,497 --> 00:16:05,157
but I want to go back to the safety,

432
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,987
and I have a question for
everyone just to think about.

433
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:12,497
The main part in all the failed missions,

434
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:14,757
especially with the
shuttle and the Challenger,

435
00:16:14,757 --> 00:16:16,657
it's basically been human error.

436
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:17,748
You know they talk about how

437
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:18,818
the higher guys wouldn't listen,

438
00:16:18,818 --> 00:16:21,398
that it was too cold outside
and the ring would break and 
everything,

439
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:24,658
but I've been thinking:

440
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:27,938
what if we were to use some
sort of higher technology

441
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:29,518
instead of relying on human
  
442
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:31,188
and the possible errors that we make.

443
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:33,954
Like robots, we use robots
to build half our cars,

444
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,374
and that probably cuts down a lot

445
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,214
on the human error rate.

446
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:39,894
So, do you think using more robotic

447
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:42,554
and higher technology than just humans,

448
00:16:42,554 --> 00:16:45,454
would that help in any
way with the safety issue

449
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,454
and the errors that we make?

450
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:49,564
- [Teacher] That's an interesting point.

451
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:51,314
We'll have to put that
on the question board.

452
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,564
Troy, what you got?

453
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,394
- Kind of to counter what A.J. said,

454
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,374
these people are highly educated.

455
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,974
Minimum wage places are probably the ones

456
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,054
that are hiring the least.

457
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,674
Companies with a lot of money

458
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:05,564
are the ones that are hiring them now.

459
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,244
People that have...

460
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:10,124
highly specialized degrees,

461
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:11,034
they're really intelligent

462
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:13,284
and they could be working

463
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:15,554
at places like in finance.

464
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:17,494
Those people are being hired

465
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,194
a lot more than people that
have financial degrees.

466
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:23,914
If you can do quantitative physics,

467
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,044
those people are going to be hired

468
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:28,374
a lot more than someone
who's just a finance agent.

469
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:29,694
- So, your counterpoint is the idea that

470
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:30,924
because they're so highly educated,

471
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,314
they will find some sort of a niche.

472
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:33,524
- Yeah. There's a lot of people

473
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,074
that actually get
degrees in rocket science

474
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:38,134
and end up going into finance

475
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:39,734
because it pays better.

476
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:41,474
- Interesting. Jillian?

477
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,474
- Back to what Alana said,

478
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:48,454
if you're using robots to make it safer,

479
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:51,014
that's also just going to cost more money

480
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:52,394
to make those robots

481
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:54,514
and to find people that
can make those robots.

482
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:57,474
If you're using robots as the engineers,

483
00:17:57,474 --> 00:18:00,874
then you're having people lose jobs.

484
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:03,324
- Interesting point.

485
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:05,294
So, kind of a counterpoint to...

486
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:09,054
shifting our focus from human
exploration to robotics,

487
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,494
there's some drawback association.

488
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:11,734
We'll go Rachel.

489
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,874
- Going back to what
Eric said a while ago,

490
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:15,034
he was talking about the military

491
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:16,094
and it has a higher budget,

492
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,206
but I feel like the military
helps a lot of people,

493
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:20,656
and it creates a lot of
jobs and educates people,

494
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:21,966
because the military pays

495
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,586
for a lot of people's
education, university and stuff.

496
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:26,646
I know a lot of people now,

497
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,466
since university is so expensive,

498
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:30,246
a lot of people are
going into the military

499
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:32,236
so they can get their education paid for.

500
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,986
So, I feel like it should
have a higher budget

501
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:35,666
because it's creating so many jobs

502
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,826
and especially for people
who aren't necessarily...

503
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:43,586
has a doctorate in physics or something.

504
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:44,776
People that are really smart,

505
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:47,506
like what Troy said,
they won't really have

506
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:49,266
that much of a problem finding jobs,

507
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,326
especially with a big corporation.

508
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:53,226
They don't have to necessarily
work for the government

509
00:18:53,226 --> 00:18:54,306
or NASA or something.

510
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,716
So, I think that the budget

511
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,687
should stay where it is,

512
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,886
because that's pretty funny.

513
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,166
- [Teacher] We'll go Megan and Tyler.

514
00:19:01,446 --> 00:19:03,146
- I don't know when it was mentioned,

515
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:06,586
but we were talking about
how we're trying to find

516
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:09,946
how the earth will be when all has failed,

517
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:12,546
and I feel like with all
the carbon dioxide emitted

518
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:16,536
and with our atmosphere right now,

519
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:18,927
we're trying to discover
what our world will be like

520
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:20,907
when all of that's gone.

521
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,707
I feel like that's really important

522
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:25,907
for the development of Earth,

523
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:27,987
is to know what it's going to be like

524
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,587
when there is no more.

525
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,467
What can we do so that we don't

526
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,207
turn into a Mars or Venus?

527
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:37,967
What can we do now to
stop it from happening?

528
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:39,967
- Good, so you're making connections

529
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,367
to maybe the video when

530
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,667
they talked about the future if there's

531
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,109
an issue with our magnetosphere.

532
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:47,309
Potentially could we wind up like Mars?

533
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:49,149
So, kind of getting a jumpstart

534
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,890
to say where we are
headed, future-wise.

535
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,570
So, almost like a selfish need

536
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,970
to figure out what's going on out there

537
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,190
and where we might go.

538
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,789
Anyone that hasn't spoken
yet want to comment?
