00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,217
- ...confusing for people to understand,

2
00:00:02,217 --> 00:00:04,751
but we're looking at density today.

3
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:09,035
We're looking at how much stuff
is packed in a certain area.

4
00:00:09,251 --> 00:00:11,851
So, if you flip over to
the back of your paper,

5
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,984
you've got that little box at the top.

6
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,684
And it tells you one of the reasons

7
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:18,985
some of the objects float
while the other objects sank

8
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,751
is because of their density.

9
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:24,804
If you could write down
the definition of density

10
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:28,001
in your box, I would appreciate that.

11
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:30,785
The amount of matter, when I say stuff,

12
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:31,951
like when we were learning about

13
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,570
solids, liquids and gases at
the beginning of the year,

14
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:36,384
stuff is matter.

15
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:40,100
So the amount of matter
that's in a certain area

16
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:42,568
is an object's density.

17
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:45,551
It's not its mass, it's its density.

18
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:50,034
So the marble is more dense
than the Styrofoam ball.

19
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:51,900
Okay?

20
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,884
So now that we know the word 'density,'

21
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:58,285
we're going to start using the word 'density'

22
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,202
for the next part.

23
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:03,250
(Classroom chatter)

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,451
The amount of stuff
packed in a certain area,

25
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,350
or the amount of matter.

26
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,084
The marble had more
matter in that small area

27
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,852
than the Styrofoam ball.

28
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:13,018
The Styrofoam ball is spread out

29
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,384
and have all those air holes,

30
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:18,018
making that matter more
spread out, less dense.

31
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:18,485
Krayla?

32
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:20,768
(Student asking question)

33
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,384
Yes, right now.

34
00:01:22,384 --> 00:01:23,818
Okay? All right.

35
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,775
So that was simple.
