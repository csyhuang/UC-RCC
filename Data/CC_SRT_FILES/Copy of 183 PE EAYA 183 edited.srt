1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,418
- [Teacher] Today we're gonna work

2
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:04,193
on soccer special olympic skills, alright?

3
00:00:04,193 --> 00:00:06,190
We've done this a couple of times before.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,152
Inside we did it on the gym floor

5
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:09,614
and the ball moved real fast.

6
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:13,016
It'll be a lot easier out
here today on the grass, ok?

7
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:13,794
You guys are gonna be awesome,

8
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:14,977
we'll have a good time.

9
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:17,694
First thing we're gonna do is dribbling.

10
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:18,913
When you dribble, I want you to use

11
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:20,968
the inside of your foot, right here.

12
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:24,532
Inside of your feet, keep the
ball real close to your feet

13
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:24,920
and dribble.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,977
When I say go, you're gonna start

15
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:27,416
right here at the start line.

16
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:28,774
And you'll dribble,

17
00:00:28,774 --> 00:00:30,840
stay in between these yellow cones,

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,301
all the way down to the finish line

19
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:36,606
where this other orange
marker is, alright?

20
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:41,079
Once you get here, put your
foot on top of the ball

21
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,461
and stop the ball.

22
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:45,972
And that's when I'll
stop the clock, alright?

23
00:00:45,972 --> 00:00:47,319
That'll be it, you just go from the start

24
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:50,308
to finish then stop right down there.

25
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,240
First time you do it,

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,634
you may have to walk and go slow.

27
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:54,481
Then we'll do it again,

28
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,258
and you can probably
get a little bit faster

29
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:58,400
the second time.

30
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,059
Alright, Taylor you wanna go first?

31
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:00,309
- [Taylor] Yeah.

32
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:02,281
- [Teacher] Show us how it's done?

33
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,713
Alright, let's go.

34
00:01:05,868 --> 00:01:06,880
Wait till I say go,

35
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,271
and then you'll be ready to roll, alright?

36
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,129
On your mark, get set,

37
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:12,516
go!

38
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:19,585
Doin' good, keepin that ball close.

39
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,036
Staying between the cones.

40
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,740
Good soft touches.

41
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:26,142
And stop it.

42
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,399
Awesome, good job.

43
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:29,700
14 seconds.

44
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,477
- [Taylor] Yeah.

45
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,079
- [Teacher] And next time you
dribble a little bit faster

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,367
and you'd do even better.

47
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,099
- [Taylor] Yeah!

48
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,736
- [Teacher] Alright, good job.

49
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:38,075
Colin, you wanna go second?

50
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,319
Yeah, come on.

51
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,750
We'll start right here by the start line,

52
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,975
right behind the start line.

53
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,864
You know what you're gonna do?

54
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:50,748
When I say go, what are you gonna do?

55
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:53,100
- [Colin] Um.

56
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:55,919
- [Teacher] Whatcha gonna do when I say go?

57
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:57,858
- [Colin] I'll just, start.

58
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:00,591
- [Teacher] Yeah you're gonna dribble
to that finish line, right?

59
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,867
When you get there,
stop it with your foot.

60
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,712
Stop the ball with your foot, ok?

61
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:05,989
You ready?

62
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:08,862
On your mark, get set, go!

63
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,369
Good, Colin.

64
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:13,853
Keep on dribbling it.

65
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:16,512
Inside the feet.

66
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,694
Good job.

67
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,272
Almost there.

68
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,185
Almost there.

69
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,546
Get across the line and stop it.

70
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,311
Good job.

71
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,051
Good job, Colin.

72
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,637
Faith, you ready?

73
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,767
Yeah, let's do that.

74
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,559
Can you get it up that hill?

75
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,754
You got it, Jessie?

76
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:01,555
Alright.

77
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:04,194
(grunting) You gotta be strong to do this.

78
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,490
Jessie's my helper, my assistant.

79
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,772
Yeah, go Faith.

80
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:16,522
Alright, Faith, you ready?

81
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:19,732
Let's get that ball in there.

82
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:23,755
Is that good?

83
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:26,291
That feel good, doesn't hurt?

84
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:28,721
He did?

85
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:29,593
Alright, y'all ready?

86
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,531
You ready Faith?

87
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,246
You ready to burn it up?

88
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:37,550
On your mark, get set, go!

89
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:40,231
There she goes.

90
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,192
There she goes.

91
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:47,433
Cross that line.

92
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,616
Stop.

93
00:03:48,616 --> 00:03:50,009
Whoo!

94
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:51,714
- [Faith] Yeah!

95
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,699
- [Teacher] How'd you do that?

96
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,448
Magic, good job Faith.

97
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:58,327
Alright.

98
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,110
Thank you, Jessie.

99
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,248
Alright, now it's your turn, Jessie.

100
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:05,785
See how fast you can do it.

101
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:09,823
I'll push Faith back
so you can get in there

102
00:04:09,823 --> 00:04:11,314
and get ready.

103
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:13,085
Alright?

104
00:04:20,335 --> 00:04:23,051
Was that fun?

105
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:27,311
You're doing a good job.

106
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:37,851
Alright Jessie, you know what to do?

107
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:38,280
- [Jessie] Yup.

108
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,563
- [Teacher] Go right there.

109
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,540
Alright, on your mark,

110
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,648
get set, go!

111
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,224
Go, go, go.

112
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,707
Jessie's flyin'.

113
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,367
Get there and stop it.

114
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,126
Get over the line, boom.

115
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,623
8.8

116
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:55,834
That's awesome.

117
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,942
Good job.

118
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,729
Alright, Taylor come on.

119
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,981
Let's go one more time.

120
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,997
And go even faster this time.

121
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,263
- [Taylor] Yeah!

122
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,725
- [Teacher] Yeah.

123
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,309
The speed of light.

124
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,922
Are you ready?

125
00:05:15,922 --> 00:05:18,830
On your mark, get set, go!

126
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,895
Oh, she's flyin'.

127
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:24,890
Keep it inside the cones, whoah.

128
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,593
Whoo!

129
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:29,950
So much faster, how'd you do that

130
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,359
so much faster?

131
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,548
That's five seconds faster.

132
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,497
That's awesome!

133
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,880
Colin, come on.

134
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,689
You ready?

135
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:53,552
Yup.

136
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:55,902
Alright.

137
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,926
You know what you're doing, right?

138
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,994
Dribble down there and stop.

139
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,137
She's over there.

140
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:03,298
You ready?

141
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,421
Alright Colin, on your mark.

142
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,873
She's just sittin down right now.

143
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:09,572
On your mark, get set, go.

144
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,924
Good job.

145
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:20,519
You're doin' good, Colin, keep going.

146
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,541
See if you can get across that line

147
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,486
and stop it.

148
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:24,320
Bottom of your foot, boom.

149
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,045
Good job.

150
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,111
Hey, that was faster than last time.

151
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:28,579
Good job.

152
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,436
Alright, Faith, you're up!

153
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,741
Faith's turn.

154
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:47,731
Faith is excited, I can tell.

155
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:48,335
Turn a little bit more

156
00:06:48,335 --> 00:06:51,127
just so I can get the head straight ahead.

157
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:54,035
(mumbling) There you go, just like that.

158
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:55,752
Alright, Faith.

159
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:02,021
You let me know if you're ready?

160
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,099
Is that good, Faith?

161
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:04,818
Alright.

162
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:07,971
On your mark, get set, go!

163
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,883
Uh-oh we're stuck in the grass.

164
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,009
Must be in a little hole there.

165
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,820
There you go.

166
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:18,446
(Faith giggling excitedly)

167
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,238
- [Teacher] Faster than last time.

168
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,818
Good job, Faith.

169
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:29,344
How'd you do that?

170
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,560
How did you do it?

171
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,206
Good job.

172
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:33,794
Alright Jessie, you get back.

173
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:34,751
Get ready to go.

174
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:36,565
I'll push Faith back.

175
00:07:36,565 --> 00:07:38,881
Good job Faith.

176
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,855
Awesome.

177
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,144
- [Faith] I'm doing great today, huh?

178
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:53,203
- [Teacher] You're doing great.

179
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,855
Doing great.

180
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,161
Alright.

181
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:58,815
Here you go, Jessie.

182
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:02,076
Last one, then we'll go to shooting.

183
00:08:02,076 --> 00:08:05,438
On your mark, get set, go!

184
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,270
Fast as you can go.

185
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,203
He's flyin'.

186
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,086
Good job.

187
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,211
Gimme five on that.

188
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,005
Alright, y'all ready to
move to the shooting?

189
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,313
Colin, come on over.

190
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:31,039
You wanna push Faith over, Jessie?

191
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:59,675
I'ma let Faith go first on this one.

192
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:01,364
Ok?

193
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:06,570
Faith, you're gonna go
first on this one, ok?

194
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:10,499
Alright guys, the way this one works,

195
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,056
we're gonna be shooting on that goal.

196
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:14,621
Everytime you make a
goal, you get ten points.

197
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,308
You guys are gonna get
a lot of points today.

198
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,581
Now when I say go, shoot
five balls, alright?

199
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,880
When I say go, I'll put a ball right here,

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,209
and you'll start at this line, you run up,

201
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,272
shoot in the goal.

202
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:29,687
Then you'll come back to this line,

203
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,068
i'll put another ball down.

204
00:09:31,068 --> 00:09:34,249
You run up, shoot it in the goal, ok?

205
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,693
Kick it in the goal.

206
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:38,544
That's right, Taylor.

207
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:42,665
Faith is gonna go first.

208
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,147
Are you ready?

209
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,702
On your mark, get set, go.

210
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:53,465
Come all the way up to
get the ball, Jessie.

211
00:09:53,465 --> 00:09:55,403
Alright, throw it in there, Faith.

212
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,290
Oh yeah, that's ten points.

213
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,506
Goin in, goin in. Whoo!

214
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:00,633
Good job.

215
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,332
Alright, that's good.

216
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:05,810
Go Faith, go Faith.

217
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,858
Ooh, you're throwing them hard today.

218
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:12,873
Three more.

219
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,591
You must've had a big old breakfast.

220
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:17,765
You got lots of energy today.

221
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:21,323
Go, go, go, three in the goal.

222
00:10:21,909 --> 00:10:23,900
Two more.

223
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:28,420
Good job Faith, throw it hard.

224
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,614
Uh-oh that one hit a bump,

225
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:33,069
went sideways.

226
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,368
Last one.

227
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:37,264
Throw it hard, hard, hard, hard.

228
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:39,505
Yeah, good job.

229
00:10:41,445 --> 00:10:42,560
That one's in the net.

230
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,183
Good job, Faith.

231
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,104
Good job.

232
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,985
Jessie, you ready?

233
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,676
I'ma let you blast the net.

234
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,934
That's fine like that.

235
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,439
Alright,

236
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:11,375
don't break my goal.

237
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,398
Don't kick them so hard
you break the net, alright?

238
00:11:14,398 --> 00:11:16,453
Are you ready?

239
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:19,703
On your mark, get set, go.

240
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,317
Fire that thing in there, boom.

241
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,389
Good one.

242
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:28,271
Boom, two good ones.

243
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,931
Boom, three.

244
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:34,419
You're bombin' em.

245
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,417
Four.

246
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:39,028
Last one.

247
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,095
Five for five, awesome.

248
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:45,523
Alright, get those balls.

249
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:47,043
Who wants to go next?

250
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:49,929
Taylor, I knew it was gonna be you.

251
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:59,395
Think you can make all five, Taylor?

252
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,668
Do you think you can make all five of 'em?

253
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:02,892
- [Taylor] Yeah!

254
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,557
- [Teacher] I do too.

255
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,605
Whoops, score a backwards goal.

256
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:11,273
Alright, thank you Jessie.

257
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:15,934
Alright, Taylor.

258
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:17,861
Here's the challenge, you ready?

259
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:20,769
On your mark, get set, go.

260
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,450
Boom, that's one.

261
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,143
Number two!

262
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,134
In the goal.

263
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,346
Number three.

264
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:34,675
Another goal.

265
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,933
Number four.

266
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:39,365
Another goal.

267
00:12:39,365 --> 00:12:41,049
What in the world?

268
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,071
Number five.

269
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:47,337
Woo! Awesome, good job.

270
00:12:47,337 --> 00:12:50,780
Alright Taylor, you can get those?

271
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:03,036
Taylor, you decide not to get 'em?

272
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:05,478
Silly?

273
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:07,761
Thank you.

274
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,942
Alright, Colin.

275
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:12,356
It is your turn.

276
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,606
Big Colin.

277
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:19,024
See if you can kick 'em all in.

278
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:25,480
Are you ready?

279
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,644
On your mark.

280
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,703
Start right there on that line.

281
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,038
Soon as I put the ball
down you're ready to go.

282
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:32,545
Mark, set, go!

283
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,507
Boom, good kick.

284
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:36,400
Back to that line.

285
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,302
Next one, shoot it in.

286
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,513
Good shot.

287
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:43,312
Colin's a lefty.

288
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,553
Alright, shoot it in, next one.

289
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:46,642
Whoo, good one.

290
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,505
Two more.

291
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,790
Number four, in the goal.

292
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,000
Good job, Colin.

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,042
Last one, let's do it.

294
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,787
Whoo, good job.

295
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,658
Alright, lets go one more time.

296
00:14:15,658 --> 00:14:16,770
Then we'll move to the dribbling,

297
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,829
I mean the run and kick.

298
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:21,028
Ok, so Faith's up first, come on.

299
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,820
We're gonna do this one more time.

300
00:14:25,288 --> 00:14:27,789
Practice it one more time.

301
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:30,482
Yeah, Thursday.

302
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:33,749
Y'all goin'?

303
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,839
Y'all better be.

304
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,139
Alright, you ready?

305
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,548
Go!

306
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:38,052
Alright, Faith.

307
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:39,816
See if you can score

308
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,012
some more goals.

309
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:41,755
There's a good one.

310
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,997
That one's in the net.

311
00:14:42,997 --> 00:14:45,754
Good job.

312
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:48,225
Alright.

313
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:49,444
All the way up and get it.

314
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:51,912
And shoot it in, Faith.

315
00:14:51,912 --> 00:14:54,116
Oh yeah.

316
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,731
It's in, good shot.

317
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,112
Come on.

318
00:14:59,112 --> 00:14:59,809
Strong as you can,

319
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,562
all that muscle you've
been workin' on the arms.

320
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,930
There you go, good job.

321
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,601
You made that one easily.

322
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:08,142
Two more.

323
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:09,641
Remember, all that muscle
you've been working on

324
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,360
on your arms.

325
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,542
Shoot it there.

326
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,063
Look at you!

327
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:16,197
You've been hidin that strength from me.

328
00:15:16,197 --> 00:15:16,840
How'd you do that?

329
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,640
Alright, last one.

330
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,963
Shoot it in.

331
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:21,448
Guess all that exercise is payin' off.

332
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:23,787
Good job, Faith.

333
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,550
Good job, how'd you do that?

334
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,285
It's magic.

335
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,706
Jessie, you're up.

336
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:34,959
I'll get these, you get ready.

337
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,390
Alright Jessie, you ready?

338
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,691
Big man?

339
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,364
On your mark, get set, go!

340
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:57,479
Fire it in there.

341
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:59,580
Poof, power!

342
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,123
Next one, fire it in there.

343
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,479
You got the hardest shot, that's for sure.

344
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,162
Go!

345
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,999
Shoot like the guys on my team.

346
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,407
Go.

347
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:12,434
Boom!

348
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,668
Last one.

349
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:16,861
Boom!

350
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,555
Good job.

351
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,570
Who's up now, Taylor?

352
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,240
And then Colin, alright.

353
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:28,511
Whew!

354
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,054
Got me runnin all over.

355
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,896
Alright, Taylor's turn.

356
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,583
On your mark--

357
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,104
Can she make five in a row again?

358
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,009
- [Taylor] Alright.

359
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,613
- [Teacher] I bet you can!

360
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:43,030
You little athlete.

361
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,527
On your mark, get set, go.

362
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,129
No, I messed up.

363
00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:47,380
Go.

364
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,704
Holy cow, you almost kicked that one over.

365
00:16:51,704 --> 00:16:54,106
How'd you get that so high?

366
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:58,318
Doing the chip shots.

367
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,181
Two for two.

368
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:02,061
Uh-oh.

369
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:02,751
Scoopin it.

370
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,109
Three for three.

371
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,414
Better be careful you
don't go over the goal.

372
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,884
You might kick a football field goal.

373
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:09,223
There you go, four for four.

374
00:17:09,223 --> 00:17:11,076
Last one.

375
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,705
Ooh, good job.

376
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:15,271
Awesome, you help me
get the balls this time?

377
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:15,910
- [Taylor] Yeah.

378
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,366
- [Teacher] Thank you.

379
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,180
Alright Colin.

380
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:23,320
That was good, Taylor.

381
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,655
That was incredible.

382
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:33,095
Colin's turn

383
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,765
to shoot 'em again.

384
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:38,638
Alright, thank you Taylor.

385
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:40,298
- [Taylor] You're welcome.

386
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,353
- [Teacher] Alright Colin, you ready?

387
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,832
Mark, get set, go!

388
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:45,399
Shoot it in there.

389
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,838
Whoo, good left foot.

390
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,870
Alright, back up.

391
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,017
Go.

392
00:17:51,017 --> 00:17:51,800
Good job.

393
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,238
Alright, number three, back on up.

394
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,827
Alright, go.

395
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:58,000
Good job, Colin.

396
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,507
Back up.

397
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,201
Number four.

398
00:18:03,201 --> 00:18:06,479
Awesome, last one.

399
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:11,737
Good job, buddy, that was awesome.

400
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:15,853
Alright, y'all ready to
move to the next one?

401
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:17,519
Let's do it.

402
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:23,050
Let's do it.

403
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,008
Ok, that sounds good.

404
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:39,833
Alright let's head this
way to the run and kick.

405
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,532
This is the one that's kinda tricky.

406
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,494
Y'all remember this one?

407
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:48,133
You gotta know which direction to go in.

408
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:52,608
Four balls going in a circle.

409
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:55,551
Is Jessie going first?

410
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,600
Alright.

411
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:22,936
Alright, last one.

412
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:23,551
Last event.

413
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,348
You guys remember this one, right?

414
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:29,046
Run and kick, you're
gonna start. (laughing)

415
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:30,677
Start right here in the middle, alright?

416
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:33,334
Arrows going to number one first.

417
00:19:33,334 --> 00:19:34,976
When I say go, I start the clock.

418
00:19:34,976 --> 00:19:38,097
Fast as you can run up to this ball.

419
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:40,558
Just pass it through those two cones.

420
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:41,498
Then we're gonna go this way

421
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:43,333
following the arrows to number two.

422
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,096
Same thing, pass it through those cones.

423
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:51,040
Number three, pass it through these cones.

424
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,953
Then to number four, pass
it through those cones.

425
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:58,075
And as soon as you kick
that ball, the clock stops.

426
00:19:58,075 --> 00:19:58,958
Alright?

427
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,373
Remember, you don't have to
hit it real hard on these.

428
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,836
Just kick it easy, nice and soft

429
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,192
and aim it between those cones.

430
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:08,395
Jessie, you're the first one up.

431
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:10,585
You ready?

432
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,740
Start on that arrow in the
middle and I'll say go.

433
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:20,221
On your mark, get set, go.

434
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:23,557
Boom, alright.

435
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,394
Go faster if you can.

436
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:26,788
I know you can go faster than that.

437
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:28,174
There you go.

438
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,241
There you go.

439
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,517
Alright.

440
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,447
13 seconds, that was flying.

441
00:20:35,447 --> 00:20:36,946
You wanna get that one
right there, Jessie?

442
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:38,594
Taylor, can you get that ball?

443
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,928
Colin, you get that ball right there?

444
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:44,417
We're gonna set 'em up and go again.

445
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:10,822
Alright, Taylor.

446
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:12,609
You wanna go next?

447
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,812
Ok.

448
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:17,534
Yeah, you can do that if you want.

449
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:18,303
That'd be great.

450
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:19,892
Thank you.

451
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:23,227
Colin, you ready to go after Taylor?

452
00:21:23,227 --> 00:21:27,429
Alright Taylor, are you ready?
- [Taylor] Ready.

453
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,336
- [Teacher] On your mark, get set, go!

454
00:21:33,268 --> 00:21:35,434
Boom, perfect.

455
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,533
Beautiful.

456
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:42,816
Awesome.

457
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:45,540
Terrific.

458
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,596
13 seconds, you were flying.

459
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:49,116
Good job.

460
00:21:49,116 --> 00:21:50,684
Get that ball for me?

461
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,186
Good job, Taylor.

462
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,985
Aim it right in there,

463
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,429
nice and soft.

464
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:03,808
Thank you for getting that ball, Colin.

465
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,407
I don't know, are you?

466
00:22:16,457 --> 00:22:19,585
- [Colin] Is it my turn?
