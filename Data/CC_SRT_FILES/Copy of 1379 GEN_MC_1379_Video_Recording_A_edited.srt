1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:03,201
(crosstalk)

2
00:00:04,065 --> 00:00:05,948
- I don't want a straight line.

3
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:06,781
- No.

4
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:07,614
- I like curves.

5
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,181
- Yeah, a lot.

6
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,713
- Because the friction in the air--

7
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:11,546
- Yeah.

8
00:00:11,546 --> 00:00:13,055
- Pushes it, and the gravity (mumbles)

9
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,149
going on the next turn.

10
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,279
- I think it's because
there's like a big wall,

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,341
and that's a small little plane,

12
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:21,469
and everything has gravity.

13
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,970
- You need to pull on the string.

14
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,577
(all agreeing about pulling)

15
00:00:24,577 --> 00:00:26,557
- And, the reason why
it's not going that way

16
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:29,807
is because that wall will stray them away.

17
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:33,019
- The wings get cool.

18
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:35,571
- What was your longest throw?

19
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:36,699
How long was it?

20
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:37,667
- Oh, it was--

21
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,500
(coughing)

22
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,667
- It was mine, and it was
probably one, two, three,

23
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:45,477
four, five, six.

24
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:47,082
Five-

25
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:48,332
- No, it's six.

26
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,475
- One, two, three, four, five, six.

27
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:56,700
- Into the six, but not before the six.

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,538
- Oh yes, into the six.

29
00:00:58,538 --> 00:00:59,371
- Alright.

30
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:03,151
Go over there, check that out.

31
00:01:04,749 --> 00:01:05,582
- 38.

32
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:10,589
- Four hundred--

33
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:12,089
- 538 centimeters.

34
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,315
- Yeah.

35
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,952
- Let's put how many meters.

36
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:18,952
Five meters.

37
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:21,558
- Write 538.

38
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:28,953
- But, why did, because fliers
don't go into the wall.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,643
- Because ...

40
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:36,591
Everything has a little bit of gravity.

41
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,453
There's not a whole lot of gravity

42
00:01:38,453 --> 00:01:40,583
where it would just go (smacking).

43
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,275
- Yeah, and then that doesn't
have a lot of gravity, but I mean--

44
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:46,221
- I can see that, but he threw it high

45
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:48,031
and it went up to the wall right there.

46
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,413
(crosstalk)

47
00:01:50,413 --> 00:01:51,246
- But, it kind of did like that.

48
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:53,913
- But, it didn't really smash.

49
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,663
- I mean, it didn't go and stick.

50
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,448
- Yeah, it didn't go.

51
00:02:00,506 --> 00:02:03,440
Gravity pulled it, but it
wasn't going to hold it there.

52
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,413
- Yeah.

53
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:05,488
(crosstalk)

54
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:06,729
- It's got more force on it.

55
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:07,934
- Yeah, I think there's more gravity

56
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:09,934
up there than right here

57
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,941
because that's higher,

58
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:15,274
and it's closer.

59
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,283
It's like, it has a lot more gravity.

60
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:24,555
- What has more gravity?

61
00:02:24,555 --> 00:02:27,508
- (all together) Up there.

62
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:28,530
(mumbles)

63
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,438
- Had more pull?

64
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:34,026
- I think the reason why
the sticks were going

65
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:36,459
and the straw was going this way is

66
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,739
because everything has
a little bit of gravity--

67
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:40,900
- And, the wall!

68
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,540
- And, the wall, it like, a
lot bigger than that stick,

69
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,152
and it's gravity that's pulling it there,

70
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,478
but it doesn't have enough gravity

71
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,433
where it will just be like--

72
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,208
- It's not like this!

73
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,775
- Okay, so if everything
has a little bit of gravity,

74
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:01,220
what is the major gravity pull, though,

75
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,549
that is bringing it down?

76
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,739
- The Earth.

77
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,162
- The Earth, because--

78
00:03:05,162 --> 00:03:06,852
(all talking together)

79
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:09,305
That's why, like if we threw this,

80
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:13,222
that's why--
 (crosstalk)

81
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:16,132
- That's why it chops.

82
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:26,069
- Okay, this one went,
it went three meters,

83
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:28,337
330 centimeters.

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,613
(mumbles)

85
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:39,915
This one covered straw with
paper and this one glides.

86
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,278
- It's a lot bigger.

87
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:45,419
- So, when it went like here,
it went all the way down

88
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,660
to the (mumbles).

89
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,594
- Yeah, it's faster because it's bigger

90
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:56,348
and this one's smaller
and it doesn't go far.

91
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:58,648
- Glider, the other one's probably bigger.

92
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:00,898
(agreeing)

93
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:06,528
- This one's also flat

94
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,948
so it's got a better chance to glide.

95
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:09,781
- Yeah.

96
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:14,362
That one's like round and bigger,

97
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,594
and it doesn't flop on the,

98
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:18,814
and it doesn't go, like, far.

99
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:21,455
When you throw it, it doesn't, like,

100
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,958
when it goes it doesn't go far,

101
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,708
but this one, like, it'll go far.

102
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:34,602
- What do you think would
happen if we put a paperclip

103
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,482
on either the front or the back?

104
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:40,315
- It would help--

105
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:41,148
- It would lay it a little bit down--

106
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:44,540
- It would go a little
bit down, because it's,

107
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,849
it has more weight, it'll go down.

108
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:47,926
- If you put a paperclip on it,

109
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:50,008
like a paperclip's not that
heavy, but it would make it,

110
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:53,627
like, when we fly it,
it goes up in the air,

111
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,806
and then comes back down and floats down.

112
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,246
That's why they're so short.

113
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:58,392
- What makes it come down?

114
00:04:58,392 --> 00:04:59,319
- Gravity.

115
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,348
- Okay.

116
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:03,439
- And, like you put a paperclip
on it, it'll come down.

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,185
Because the paperclip is
heavier than the straw.

118
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:09,137
- What if you put it on the back?

119
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:11,776
- It would, it would ...

120
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,222
- It would kind of slow it.

121
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:17,389
It would be like that (mumbles).

122
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,833
- Okay, can you think of?

123
00:05:23,746 --> 00:05:24,726
What about this one?

124
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:26,343
What if we put the paperclip on this one?

125
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:27,412
- It would--

126
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:28,353
- It wouldn't feel.

127
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,686
It would get worse.

128
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,650
- If we put the paperclip on here,

129
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:39,355
then it would get all messed up

130
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:44,852
because if it's flat and
it's trying to (mumbles).

131
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:47,674
It has weight, it will just go.

132
00:05:47,674 --> 00:05:48,745
- Uh-huh, right.

133
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:53,512
That one, when you fly it,
before we got the paperclip,

134
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:56,286
it goes high before it comes down.

135
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:58,926
But, when we put the paperclip on it,

136
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,228
it goes straight down, like that.

137
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:03,895
And, like without the paperclip,

138
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:07,064
without the paperclip
on it, it will go like,

139
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,005
it will go like an ocean.

140
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,761
(crosstalk)

141
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,030
With the paperclip on
there, it would go farther.

142
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,765
It would go farther and then it'll fall

143
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:19,265
just down like that, but not go like that.

144
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,780
- This one, let's try this one!

145
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,464
- See, that one goes a lot farther.

146
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,363
- And, it probably goes farther

147
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:43,780
because I put a lot of force on it.

148
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:49,061
If you even put a lot
of force on this one,

149
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:52,832
it will go down because it flies like,

150
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:54,582
I threw it like that,

151
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,019
and it just flies off,

152
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,149
because it's the gravity.

153
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,704
And you throw that one, it goes farther.

154
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,876
- Okay, so gravity makes it come down

155
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:07,379
faster than the glider?

156
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,861
- It makes it go down,

157
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:13,028
because if you just throw
it without the paperclip,

158
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:18,114
it won't, it will just come
down because of gravity.

159
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:22,886
_ Yeah, the straw one is going like that.

160
00:07:22,886 --> 00:07:25,136
And then it just goes like,

161
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,761
see how it flips down?

162
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:32,261
But, with the paperclip, it'll go farther.

163
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:35,309
- Like that.

164
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:38,712
- Tyler, what were you
saying about the air?

165
00:07:38,712 --> 00:07:39,724
Do you think that has a,

166
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,436
do you think that makes a difference

167
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,298
in what Mary Morgan
is saying this one kind

168
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,704
of floats and then comes down?

169
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,915
Go talk about that.

170
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:50,028
- See, the air--

171
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:53,549
- The air feels like windy in here.

172
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,678
- It would push it, and then it would--

173
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:56,989
- It would go like this.

174
00:07:56,989 --> 00:07:57,822
- Yeah, like that.

175
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,822
And, it would just push.

176
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:06,751
It would just push it towards
like where everything was.

177
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:12,903
- Yeah, and this one with the
paperclip goes really far.

178
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,529
- And, that paperclip,

179
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:22,076
the reason it went far

180
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:26,243
without the paperclip is
because air pushed it and force.

181
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,550
- What is that force called?

182
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,314
When you push it?

183
00:08:31,314 --> 00:08:32,799
(all unsure)

184
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,470
Remember, it's called--

185
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,303
- The thrust.

186
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:36,158
- The thrust, that's right.

187
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,408
So the thrust, when you push the plane,

188
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,413
made a difference, is that what you said?

189
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:44,246
(student agrees)

190
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,293
Could you change the one with the straw,

191
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,887
is there any changes that you could make

192
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:52,127
that you think would make it fly further?

193
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:53,677
Talk about that as a group.

194
00:08:53,677 --> 00:08:55,162
- Put two paperclips.

195
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:57,341
- One on the front and one on the back.

196
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,605
- Put the lighter one on the back.

197
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:00,744
Let's try that.

198
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:01,685
I bet it will-

199
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,352
It might go farther too.

200
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,275
Okay, now push.

201
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,640
- We have a paperclip on it,

202
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,464
and we're going to see if it
goes farther the second time.

203
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:18,749
I think, I bet it will go,
I bet it goes a lot longer.

204
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:19,916
- That's fine.

205
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:29,021
(plane impact on ground)

206
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:29,854
- Well ...

207
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:34,720
It went to 10!

208
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:37,434
- It went to 10.

209
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:39,767
(mumbles)

210
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,461
- Okay, so I want you to discuss

211
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:50,381
in this group,

212
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,562
I want you to discuss what
you found when you threw,

213
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:55,116
when you tested this
with the paperclip on it.

214
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,828
Just talk about that together.

215
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:59,828
- Well, (crosstalk).

216
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:06,181
- So when there's air, I think
when they closed the air up,

217
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,181
it went in and back out.

218
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:13,534
But, but, but, tied together (mumbles).

219
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,840
- So, if you like flip off--

220
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,059
- The paper clip.

221
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,892
- The air,

222
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,505
like if you could do this,

223
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,743
and turn off the air,

224
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:34,740
it would go further.

225
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,131
- But, if you take off of it,

226
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:39,548
I mean if you, it won't make it that far.

227
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:45,480
It will just be like (mumbles).

228
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,140
- The paper clip, the straw, it does help.

229
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,723
- Yeah, about the same
as this one without.

230
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,250
- I wonder what that one's
like with paperclips.

231
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,083
- Me too.

232
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:00,916
- I want to try it.

233
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,029
- This is my prediction.

234
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,299
I think it's on an angle--

235
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,220
- I think that's going to go further.

236
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,199
- I don't know,

237
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,554
because they don't have
no air stream to hold it.

238
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,722
(mumbles)

239
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:13,715
- I think it will go farther.

240
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,548
- I don't.

241
00:11:17,365 --> 00:11:18,198
- See?

242
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:22,365
- Well, you didn't put a
lot of force on that one.

243
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,919
Well, we all have to try.

244
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,419
- But, I still think it went the farthest,

245
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,256
but I think (mumbling).

246
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,428
- I think it's going to go farther.

247
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,564
- Nope.

248
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:44,582
- Well, it went farther than you.

249
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:45,415
- It went

250
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,667
70.

251
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:51,927
- But, I mean, it didn't go--

252
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,134
- You all tried it with this didn't you all?

253
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,051
Let me try it this way.

254
00:11:57,138 --> 00:12:01,305
- I tried it with that, I
tried it with that side.

255
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:16,541
- It all went to the yellow, but--

256
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,695
- But, it didn't--

257
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,028
- Strong enough.

258
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:23,907
- So, what did we find out back here?

259
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,657
- That it puts more weight on it so it goes.

260
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:29,894
- What puts more weight?

261
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,894
- This little paperclip.

262
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,457
The paperclip puts more
weight to that one,

263
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:36,826
and it's not going to nose dive.

264
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:40,402
But I was standing right
here and mine hit that wall.

265
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,945
And, that's without the paperclip.

266
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,276
And, then you put the paperclip on there,

267
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:46,107
it doesn't go near as far.

268
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:48,753
- Why did that make a difference?

269
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,967
Was your throws the same?

270
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:53,035
Did you use the same amount of force?

271
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:54,381
What happened?

272
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:56,970
- Mine felt like I was
using the same force.

273
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,650
I think it's just because that,

274
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,675
since there isn't any
air space on that one--

275
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:02,989
- What do you mean airspace?

276
00:13:02,989 --> 00:13:04,979
- I mean like, the air
can't go through this.

277
00:13:04,979 --> 00:13:08,396
- Yeah, like that's a
straw, it has a hole.

278
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,249
- It's just putting
more weight on that one,

279
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,632
so that's just going to go boop.

280
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:15,412
If you use this one, and put
the paperclip right here,

281
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:19,751
it's going to cut off the
air coming in right here.

282
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,593
And, that's going to go further.

283
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,883
- Oh, you're took off
the air of the straw.

284
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:25,285
And that makes it go further.

285
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:26,118
(all agreeing)

286
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:27,335
- Why does that?

287
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:31,502
- Because the air in the
straw is pulling it down because it's like...

288
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:33,664
- Do you know what that's called?

289
00:13:33,664 --> 00:13:34,807
- Gravity.

290
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:35,640
- Well, the gravity,

291
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,632
but what about the air
when the air is coming in?

292
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:38,465
- Friction!

293
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:39,298
- Oh, friction!

294
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,297
- Friction, the air is causing friction?

295
00:13:41,297 --> 00:13:42,247
Okay.

296
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:44,840
- The air's slowing it down.

297
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,673
- And, also the air.

298
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:47,316
Okay, now I want you to think about

299
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:50,591
if you change this plane in any way,

300
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:53,440
what changes could you make
to it to make it fly further?

301
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,480
- We could cut it up!

302
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,085
(extreme crosstalk)

303
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,752
- Wrap around, and then
have that like this.

304
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:08,321
- Yeah, I think that's set
to have the same throw.

305
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:12,903
Because, actually having--

306
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:15,135
(crosstalk)

307
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:20,080
- That one can go farther,
but the paperclips on it,

308
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,086
it won't fly further.

309
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:25,336
But, if you put paperclips on this one,

310
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,743
it'd probably go farther.

311
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,692
Put some paperclips on there.

312
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:36,778
- Because paperclips add more weight.

313
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,695
- Yeah, and it lets it go further.

314
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:45,184
- Here, Tyler, you want to throw?

315
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,432
- That went two.
