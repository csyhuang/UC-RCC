1
00:00:01,304 --> 00:00:02,051
- The corners.

2
00:00:02,051 --> 00:00:03,166
- [Teacher] The corners, that's fine.

3
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:07,749
How do you get exactly one painted face?

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,581
Which one of these have
just one color on them?

5
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,989
- The middle.

6
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:14,361
- [Teacher] Yeah just the ones
in the middle on each face.

7
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,775
And how many of them are there?

8
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:16,564
- Six.

9
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:17,866
- [Teacher] So that's 6 out of 27.

10
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:18,676
So that's fine.

11
00:00:18,676 --> 00:00:20,468
And realize that if you did it right,

12
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:21,609
those are all your options.

13
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:24,133
Each of these cubes
has either zero colors,

14
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:25,716
up to three colors.

15
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,661
Nothing has four colors.

16
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,441
So that means all your
probabilities should add up to what?

17
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:31,241
- [Student] 27.

18
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:32,606
- 27 out of 27.

19
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:36,516
Does it?

20
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:38,046
- [Student] No.

21
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,390
- No, so what's the issue?

22
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,565
One of these numbers
at least has to be off.

23
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:46,134
So figure out which one that is.

24
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:52,641
See if you could figure what one.

25
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,238
So keep in mind, these look right.

26
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:57,998
But realize, these are all probabilities

27
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:59,853
because you're picking
them out of that hat.

28
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,235
So, these should all be out of...

29
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:03,363
- [Student] 27.

30
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,634
- Right, because there's 27
cubes you're picking from.

31
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:06,712
- [Student] Right.

32
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:09,357
- And if you did it right
and these are all the cubes,

33
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:11,255
then they should add up to what?

34
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:12,791
- [Student] 27.

35
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:16,744
- Right, does it?

36
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,498
- [Student] Yeah it does.

37
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:19,735
- 27, okay so fine.

38
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:20,620
Good.

39
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:26,409
So when you do the next one
it should all be out of...

40
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:27,414
- We can figure that out.

41
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:32,818
- You can figure that out.

42
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:37,075
- [Student] Isn't it 16 times 4 so 64?

43
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:38,870
- So where are you getting
these numbers from?

44
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,805
- [Student] My mind.

45
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,421
- Okay, so I get no painted faces.

46
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,649
There's just the one cube
that's right in the middle.

47
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,085
So that's one out of...

48
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,085
Because you're picking them out.

49
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,333
1 out of 27.

50
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,028
You gotta do a probability, right.

51
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,194
But then how many have one painted face?

52
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:55,006
How'd you get six?

53
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:56,176
Which six?

54
00:01:56,176 --> 00:01:57,465
- The middle ones.

55
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:58,510
- Sure, the middle ones.

56
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,806
And there's six faces so it
makes sense, 6 out of 27.

57
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:03,950
How do you get three painted faces?

58
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,155
- [Student] I didn't do that one.

59
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:06,083
- Okay.

60
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,502
The corners.

61
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,867
So that should be eight.

62
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,563
And then realize if you did this right,

63
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,632
it should all at up to what?

64
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,795
- [Student] 27.

65
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:15,203
- 27 out of 27.

66
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,835
So how do you figure out

67
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:19,341
how many have two painted faces?

68
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:20,984
- Just add these together
and subtract them.

69
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:21,848
- Yeah you could do that.

70
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:23,245
Now, there is a pattern to the two,

71
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,126
just like the other ones.

72
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:27,629
But you can also subtract
and figure that out.

73
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:35,554
So, yeah, good.

74
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,575
Oh that brings up a good point.

75
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:41,177
Everybody, for your first cube...

76
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:43,388
For your very first cube everything

77
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,854
should be out of what number?

78
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:45,835
- [Students] 27.

79
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:46,667
- 27.

80
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,502
All your probabilities
should be out of 27.

81
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,103
Is it possible you can
reduce the fractions,

82
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,127
when you figure it out?

83
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,090
- [Students] Yes.

84
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,028
- Yes, I'm gonna tell
you, don't reduce them.

85
00:02:55,028 --> 00:02:57,699
Leave it out of 27.

86
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:01,219
Even if it's 3 out of 27,

87
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,081
don't reduce it to one ninth.

88
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:08,967
Just leave it at 3 out of 27,
it'll help you down the line.

89
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:09,730
So those look good.

90
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,728
And you know--

91
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:12,531
One of the ways you could
check if you did this right,

92
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:15,238
is all four of these
should add up to what?

93
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:16,053
- [Student] 27.

94
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:16,786
- 27.

95
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,077
And does it?

96
00:03:18,077 --> 00:03:19,314
- Yeah.

97
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:20,840
- It adds up to 27 out of 27.

98
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,077
So you got all your bases covered.

99
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,026
So that's good.

100
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,722
Okay, good keep going.

101
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:26,482
How many have no painted faces?

102
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,338
- Four.

103
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:30,235
- Why four, which four?

104
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,796
- The four is right over here inside,

105
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,895
and then there's four.

106
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:36,401
- Okay but let me ask you
this, there's these four.

107
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,206
But you said go inside a layer.

108
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,116
And then you're right
there's four underneath.

109
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:44,009
But then there's another
layer underneath that.

110
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,659
- So there's eight.

111
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:52,438
- So there should be eight.

112
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,205
And one of the ways you know
you're right about this,

113
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:57,413
besides just hoping that you're thinking

114
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,363
about it the right way.

115
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,898
How do you know there's
three painted faces?

116
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:02,082
Which eight are you talking about?

117
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:03,493
- [Student] The corners.

118
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,335
- The corners.

119
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:06,074
So you know you're right with the eight,

120
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:09,135
but these should all add up to what?

121
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:10,741
27 out of 27.

122
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,698
And they do, so you're okay.

123
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:13,925
Okay, good.

124
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:16,591
So keep going and you're
good, it's all out of 64.

125
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:22,499
So that's a good start.

126
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:26,483
- [Student] Will this still
have one painted face?

127
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,334
- Well there is a pattern to it,

128
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:29,614
just like the other ones.

129
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:32,515
But it's fine if you
can't figure that out yet.

130
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:34,673
Just keep going, you've
got the right number.

131
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:39,800
So see if you can figure
it out now for the 4x4x4.

132
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,931
How are we doing on the front side?

133
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,814
Everything good?

134
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,677
So let me ask you this about this stuff.

135
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,100
I assume you all have the same answers.

136
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,037
- [Student] Yeah.

137
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:51,812
- So, you said one painted
face, there's six of them.

138
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:55,183
Which six?

139
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:59,838
Just one color painted.

140
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:01,825
Sure the center of each of the six faces.

141
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:04,360
And there's six faces,
so six times one is six.

142
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,810
That's fine.

143
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,939
No, we got 8 out of 27 for three.

144
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:12,141
Because which ones are you looking at?

145
00:05:12,141 --> 00:05:13,208
The corners.

146
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,234
No painted faces, there's
just one in the middle.

147
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:18,114
If you added all these up,
what should they equal?

148
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:20,663
(background chatter)

149
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:23,682
27 out of 27 because that's all the cubes.

150
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:26,519
But what does it equal up to?

151
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,695
Not 27.

152
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,139
So, what's the issue?

153
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,692
What's the deal there?

154
00:05:30,692 --> 00:05:32,712
- [Student] No idea.

155
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:36,502
- Where is there something going wrong?

156
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:45,591
Because you know that one has to be eight.

157
00:05:45,591 --> 00:05:47,160
You know there's exactly one

158
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,248
because it's the center one
in each of the six sides.

159
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,691
So, you know that has to be six.

160
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,451
The issue is with the two painted faces.

161
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,125
It's not eight.

162
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,493
Now, you can figure it out by subtracting,

163
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,832
and just figuring out what adds up to 27.

164
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,389
Or you could go back
and just look at those,

165
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,237
how many of those have
the two painted faces.

166
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:11,307
Where are you getting eight from?

167
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:14,420
Which cubes here have two painted faces?

168
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,158
- These ones.

169
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,491
- So that's four on this front side.

170
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,794
- There's four on the back side.

171
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:20,986
- That's eight.

172
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:22,720
- Two on this side, 10, 12.

173
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,247
- 12.

174
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:25,993
Does that make sense?

175
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,700
And that adds up to 27 then,

176
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,990
when you add all those up.

177
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,939
So now do the same thing
for the one out of 64.

178
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:35,871
Okay.

179
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,781
Good.

180
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:39,280
How we doing?

181
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,020
- These should add up
to 64 shouldn't they?

182
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,535
- They should add up to 64.

183
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,743
How do you get no painted faces?

184
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:47,715
How do you get the four
with no painted faces?

185
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:49,074
- [Student] The center pieces.

186
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:51,852
- So, over here, let's say
these four in the middle.

187
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:53,127
But you're not looking at those.

188
00:06:53,127 --> 00:06:54,119
Those have one painted face,

189
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,028
but you look a layer below that.

190
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,565
And that's four right there.

191
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:00,460
But you can go a layer below that.

192
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,830
So that should be eight.

193
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,181
So does that mess up something else?

194
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:06,267
I don't know how you
got the other numbers.

195
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,355
- So the equation for this,

196
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:10,928
it'd be distance...

197
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:13,498
divided by two to get three.

198
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:17,496
- Does that work up here?

199
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:18,554
You're on the right track.

200
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:19,770
You're thinking the right way.

201
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,783
- Minus two.

202
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:22,951
- Does that work?

203
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:27,268
I mean, once you get this, I
would try to do a 5x5x5 cube.

204
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,033
Even though, I didn't write it down there.

205
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,543
See if it holds up.

206
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,800
- Yeah, because there'd
be 27 in the middle.

207
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,414
- That seems to make sense.

208
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:43,452
And that'll help you on the
back side when you get there.

209
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,779
So these look fine.

210
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,232
Let's talk about this one for a second.

211
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,744
If you add these up,
you have 24, 24, 18, 4.

212
00:07:50,744 --> 00:07:53,549
If you add all those up what do you get?

213
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:56,763
(background chatter)

214
00:07:56,763 --> 00:07:59,490
Do you?

215
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,515
24 plus 24 is 48.

216
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:05,307
- 60.

217
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:06,182
- [Teacher] 60.

218
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:07,714
Right now you have 60 out of 64.

219
00:08:07,714 --> 00:08:09,591
So there's four squares
you haven't counted yet.

220
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,868
Where did they go?

221
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,769
And you kinda know you're right
with the three colored cubes

222
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,838
because you know which ones they are.

223
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,699
Which ones are those?

224
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,710
- So would we add it to
the non painted faces?

225
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,195
- Why?

226
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:25,910
You can't randomly--

227
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,537
What's the pattern?

228
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:30,560
Which ones have no painted faces?

229
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,181
- The ones on the top.

230
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:36,195
- So basically, you have
these four right here,

231
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,778
but a layer below, right?

232
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:41,514
But there's also another layer below that.

233
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:43,209
- Oh so it's eight.

234
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:45,231
- So that's where there's eight.

235
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:46,238
Does that make sense?

236
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,444
- Oh yeah, I see that.

237
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,375
- So that's where that's coming from.

238
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,804
So now it adds up to 64.

239
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:53,225
It looks like you're probably good.

240
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:56,382
Why don't you try doing
it for a 5x5x5 cube

241
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:57,609
before you go to the back side,

242
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,970
so at least you have some
patterns you can detect.

243
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,770
It'll make the back side easier.

244
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:09,563
But it should be a breeze
now to get the 5x5x5 cube.

245
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,384
Wow, Chris.

246
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:18,090
You're on a roll.

247
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,954
Smart idea, making a graph.

248
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:25,924
And that should be eight over what?

249
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:33,593
(background chatter)

250
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,114
Over here how many squares do we have?

251
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:37,491
- We have 27.

252
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,846
- And you got that because it's...

253
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,270
- Three cubed.

254
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,299
- [Teacher] Three cubed.

255
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,241
And the other one is four cubed.

256
00:09:44,241 --> 00:09:47,206
If you do the 5x5x5,
it would be five cubed.

257
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:50,736
So if you have an nxnxn, what is that?

258
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:51,824
n cubed.

259
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,624
So everything should be
out of n cubed on the back.

260
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:57,445
And you're right that
it's eight out of n cube

261
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,568
for the three painted.

262
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,275
Why don't you try the no painted?

263
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:04,310
That's probably the next one to get.

264
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:07,919
- [Student] But what,
there's the one middle.

265
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,989
- How do you figure that out?

266
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:10,340
And this is where you gotta go back

267
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,301
and look at the pattern you
got for no painted faces.

268
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,279
How did you figure that out?

269
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,623
And maybe the numbers help,

270
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,713
but maybe just look at the
picture and figure out,

271
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:21,500
how did we know how many
had no painted faces?

272
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,516
- [Student] Right.

273
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:23,859
- What do those numbers have in common?

274
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:26,759
- [Student] Okay.

275
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,699
- How we doing?

276
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:33,795
Well you're definitely right
with eight over n cubed.

277
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:35,222
That makes sense, right?

278
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:37,816
Because always the corners in the cube.

279
00:10:37,816 --> 00:10:39,139
It's always the same.

280
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,061
How did you get 6n here?

281
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,041
And you got it over here.

282
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,802
You guys have 6n in different places.

283
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:47,465
- Well see, I thought I got a brain blast.

284
00:10:47,465 --> 00:10:49,079
- What?

285
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,445
- But it didn't work out.

286
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,637
I mean, I felt really
smart for two seconds.

287
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:55,351
But I was thinking that,
since there's six sides,

288
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:57,059
it has to be six times something.

289
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,135
- Okay.

290
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,567
Okay, that's not a bad way to think.

291
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:02,607
You know the answer here was 12.

292
00:11:02,607 --> 00:11:03,329
- Yeah.

293
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,806
- That was with the 3x3x3 cube.

294
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:07,468
Does that work?

295
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:11,531
If n is three, you would get 18.

296
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,707
But that's not what you
got on the front side.

297
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,456
So there's some discrepancy.

298
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:16,288
- Okay.

299
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,735
- But that's not a bad way to think.

300
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:21,888
Some of these things have
to do with six faces.

301
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,787
Like, there's some
multiplying by six involved.

302
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:26,090
You know the corner ones are
gonna be eight no matter what.

303
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,128
That has nothing to do with six faces.

304
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:28,857
- Right.

305
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:30,319
- Right, that's just the corners.

306
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,372
- [Student] How do you do this?

307
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:33,930
- Go back a second.

308
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,541
Sorry, a lot of flipping.

309
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,207
You feel confident about
these two sets of numbers?

310
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:38,975
- [Student] Yeah.

311
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,599
- So why don't you try
doing it 5x5x5 cube,

312
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:43,337
even though I didn't ask for it.

313
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:45,215
But see what numbers you get for that

314
00:11:45,215 --> 00:11:47,956
because it'll make the
back page a little better.

315
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,630
Because now you'll have
more numbers to use

316
00:11:49,630 --> 00:12:00,950
and try to find a pattern.

317
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,398
You guys have different numbers.

318
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:03,210
Why is that?

319
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,217
- [Student] What do you mean?

320
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:05,299
- On the front side.

321
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,529
- [Student] What do you mean?

322
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,573
- Sarah has 8 out of 64 here.

323
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:10,834
You have 4 out of 64 here.

324
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,274
- [Student] Oh blood.

325
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,565
- Oh my god.

326
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:14,845
Do you need to go?

327
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:15,699
Go, go.

328
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:16,649
Go to the bathroom.

329
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:17,653
- [Student] I don't care.

330
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,418
- I care, go.

331
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:19,700
- [Student] Do you have band-aids now?

332
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,562
- I don't know.

333
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:21,415
I don't think I do.

334
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:24,926
Go to the bathroom.

335
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,680
Things still happen.

336
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,775
So you have eight out of eight cubed.

337
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:31,433
That's fine...

338
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:33,852
We know the three painted faces
are going to be which ones?

339
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:34,790
The corners.

340
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,602
- The corners.

341
00:12:35,602 --> 00:12:36,673
And there's always gonna be eight.

342
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,613
So that's fine.

343
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:38,975
Eight out of n cubed.

344
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:44,642
How do you figure out how
many have zero painted faces?

345
00:12:44,642 --> 00:12:46,190
- It's always the ones in the middle.

346
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,971
- Yes, always the ones in the middle.

347
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,571
So when you had a 3x3x3 cube,

348
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,813
what was in the middle?

349
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,688
- One.

350
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,130
- And what's the dimensions of that cube?

351
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,221
1x1x1.

352
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,098
When it was a 4x4x4 cube,

353
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:00,847
what were the dimensions of the middle?

354
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,330
That you couldn't see.

355
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,951
- 4x4x4.

356
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,159
- Well 4x4x4 is the whole cube.

357
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,460
- 2x2x2.

358
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,017
- [Teacher] 2x2x2.

359
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:11,311
If it was a 5x5x5 cube
what would be the middle?

360
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,226
- 3x3x3.

361
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,476
- [Teacher] 3x3x3.

362
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:20,844
If its an nxnxn cube, what's the middle?

363
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:22,524
You kinda have it.

364
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:25,594
If it's 6x6x6, what's the middle?

365
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:26,641
- [Student] I don't know.

366
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:27,395
I'm kinda lost.

367
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:28,765
- Okay go back for a second.

368
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,819
You lost me at the 5x5x5 one.

369
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,440
- Okay, you know its 3x3x3.

370
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,253
And the center was 1x1x1.

371
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,386
That's the ones you
couldn't see any color.

372
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:39,063
4x4x4 cube, what's the center?

373
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,194
- [Student] 2x2x2.

374
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,210
- If it's a 5x5x5 cube, let's say.

375
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,034
What would the center be?

376
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:45,271
- [Student] 3x3x3.

377
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,402
- 3x3x3.

378
00:13:46,402 --> 00:13:48,660
If it's a 6x6x6 cube?

379
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,284
- [Student] 4x4x4.

380
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:52,695
- If it's an nxnxn cube?

381
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,092
- [Student] n minus two.

382
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,237
- Times n minus two times n minus two.

383
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,801
So what's the pattern
for no painted faces?

384
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,539
- [Student] n minus two cubed.

385
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:04,533
- Exactly.

386
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,518
That's the sort of
pattern you need to find

387
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:09,435
for those first two now.

388
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:11,712
How are you figuring these out

389
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:15,865
when you actually have
a concrete 5x5x5 cube?

390
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:17,120
- Is this what you're supposed to do?

391
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,096
Because it's saying that n
is the number of small cubes,

392
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:23,510
so you can't just say it's a 4x4x4.

393
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,570
n is representing the
whole 125 cubes right?

394
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,711
- Right.

395
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:29,670
- So is this the correct
equation for one painted sides?

396
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,986
- For one painted side?

397
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:32,052
- Yeah.

398
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:33,567
- For one painted side.

399
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:36,635
Well, how are you finding
the one painted face?

400
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,671
Or how many painted
cubes did you have here?

401
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,183
- I had six.

402
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:44,014
- Six, which six?

403
00:14:44,014 --> 00:14:46,270
It's basically the one in the center,

404
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,328
but there's six faces
so we multiplied by six.

405
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,078
So, I get where this is coming from.

406
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:51,418
The multiply by six.

407
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,589
- So n represents the 125.

408
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:56,439
- n represents how many across you have.

409
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,639
- Oh.

410
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:58,920
I thought n represented the whole--

411
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,117
- No, I mean.
