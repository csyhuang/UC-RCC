1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
[Background chatter]

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,500
- We all know it's splash.

3
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,040
Just put it next to it.

4
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:07,745
- Your turn.

5
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:09,255
- Okay, let's see.

6
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:12,197
- [Teacher] How are we doing?

7
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:13,747
How many animals do we have?

8
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,499
Do you have a few?

9
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:17,596
- We think mussel...

10
00:00:17,596 --> 00:00:18,529
- It can be in the middle.

11
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:20,739
- It can be in the high
tide and the low tide.

12
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,078
- Because it can move around.

13
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:25,242
And then it eats clams

14
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,672
and clams would be in the high tide.

15
00:00:30,358 --> 00:00:32,128
- It can grab on to the wave.

16
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:37,653
It eats clams.

17
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:40,183
- It says this eats clams.

18
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:44,345
- I saw the, of the mussels sort of

19
00:00:44,355 --> 00:00:47,392
in the mid-high tide one day.

20
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:48,749
- When you were out at the tides before?

21
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,499
- Yeah.

22
00:00:49,499 --> 00:00:51,167
- Excellent, so you're using some of your

23
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,887
previous experience to help you.

24
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:53,838
Good, excellent.

25
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,028
Okay, I'll be right back.

26
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:58,026
- It's a snail.

27
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:00,866
The shell protects its soft part.

28
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,786
As a hermit crab grows,

29
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:05,506
it moves into a new shell.

30
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:07,256
It may take an empty shell

31
00:01:07,256 --> 00:01:09,066
or steal one from another.

32
00:01:09,676 --> 00:01:10,827
- So it's like war.

33
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,317
- I think that would be in the high.

34
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:17,917
- Yeah, that's a high.

35
00:01:17,947 --> 00:01:19,438
- Yeah, I think the high tide.

36
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,634
- I thought it would be in the mid or low.

37
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:22,970
But no.

38
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,830
- Well it could move down there.

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,180
- What's your next one?

40
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,976
Tuesday, put this circle right
on top of the clock.

41
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:45,177
Same time.

42
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:46,577
Same height.

43
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:50,077
Wow, that's pretty interesting isn't it?

44
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,027
Good for you.

45
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,107
Oh, you're looking at your first
one. What's your first one?

46
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,027
Yeah, just line it right there on the clock.

47
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:58,867
- That's eight.

48
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,087
- Yep, like eight.

49
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,538
Yeah, excellent.

50
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,878
And Margo you're getting
your first measurement?

51
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:19,661
Negative one!

52
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,711
Oh, awesome.

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,690
Monday's negative one.

54
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,741
Hello Kazhu,

55
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,631
I will show you where you need to go.

56
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:48,233
- It's negative something.

57
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:53,225
- I don't know what negative.

58
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:57,857
It's right here. Look here.

59
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,852
12 o' clock, I think everyday.

60
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,473
- [Teacher] Did you find
out they went that low?

61
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:26,403
- Yeah.

62
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,670
- Mine went to negative six!

63
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:29,647
- Wow!

64
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,617
- I didn't put Tuesday.

65
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,403
and then I'm going to put a block under it.

66
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:36,723
- You had one that went really low.

67
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:37,741
Look at that.

68
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:39,051
Awesome.

69
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,651
You set that up first
pretty well, didn't you?

70
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,421
Look's like we got Monday

71
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,131
and Tuesdays getting done.

72
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,681
Wednesdays are being worked on.

73
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:55,651
Perfect.

74
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,062
So much to hear, what it is you guys

75
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,172
are gonna discover from the charts.

76
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,452
- [Student] Let's do a worm.

77
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:08,493
Whatever that says.

78
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,965
They have a veil of flaps on each side.

79
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,927
The worms usually stay buried

80
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,617
in the sand.

81
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,757
If a wave comes,

82
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:25,997
it swims back down toward the sand

83
00:04:26,187 --> 00:04:27,939
and wiggles into it.

84
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,459
- I'm pretty sure that's low.

85
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,489
- [Student] Yeah.

86
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:32,823
- No, how about maybe high?

87
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:33,767
- High tide.

88
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:34,917
- High tide.

89
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:37,492
- No, but the waves crash
there a lot actually.

90
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,242
- Splash!

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,970
- There's more of the sand.

92
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,171
- Yeah, I think it would be splash.

93
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,869
- [Teacher] Want to try splash on that one?

94
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,429
Good.

95
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,538
And you guys thought that because

96
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:53,318
what did it say?

97
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:55,098
- It said it buries in the sand

98
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:56,238
and if a wave crashes

99
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:57,797
it has to wriggle back down.

100
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,667
- Okay.

101
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,847
- So, it stays in sand as much as it can.

102
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:03,337
- How many does Nate have?

103
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:04,287
Oh, two.

104
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,659
- [Teacher] The whelk?

105
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,741
That's a scientific name.

106
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,210
That's a tough one, isn't it?

107
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,870
- Ah, it's hard.

108
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,171
- It's hard, it's okay you can skip it.

109
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,661
Just say "look for

110
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,495
the whelk on rocky beaches."

111
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,545
- "On rocky beaches

112
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:36,337
and on rocks, sift, or
muddy gravel beaches."

113
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,767
"The shell of the snail can reach

114
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,477
about two inches in height."

115
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:46,518
"It is a scavenger, feeding on kin.

116
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,631
It also preys on injured animals

117
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:52,997
such as limpets"

118
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:58,017
"The snail has also..."

119
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:11,008
- So, I thought the sentence said

120
00:06:11,008 --> 00:06:12,908
"it also preys on injured animals,

121
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:14,438
such as limpets."

122
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,418
So "preys on them" what does that mean?

123
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:19,808
- I think I know.

124
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,078
- What do you think, Andrew?

125
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:23,148
- It means catch them and eat them.

126
00:06:23,148 --> 00:06:24,768
- It catches them and eats them.

127
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:27,689
Where do you think that would need to be

128
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,279
if it's gonna eat limpets?

129
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,910
- I think it would be in the high tide.

130
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:43,509
- Oh, you've got both of them.

131
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,400
So, you also might want to talk to Addy

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,633
and find out what Addy has.

133
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,434
And try to figure out where those guys are

134
00:06:48,434 --> 00:06:50,124
before you place your whelk.

135
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:54,705
No, so Addy what do you think?

136
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,601
What is one of yours?

137
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:57,491
Let's find out what yours are, right?

138
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,430
- Under each shell.

139
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:05,398
I think it's already
in the high tide zone.

140
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:07,099
- I thought it would be in the splash.

141
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:08,459
- Wait, no.

142
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,730
- High, high, high.

143
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,300
- Yeah, high tide.

144
00:07:12,151 --> 00:07:13,185
Okay, the limpet...

145
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,405
- Guys, I thought it
would be in the splash.

146
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,581
- No, remember you gotta, like, figure.

147
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:19,452
Okay, I'll let you two go.

148
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:21,816
- I thought it would be splash because...

149
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,226
- No, I don't think that...

150
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:26,752
- The thing should be
underwater most of the time.

151
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:30,668
- It says "Watch for
whelks on rocky beaches

152
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:34,088
and muddy or gravel beaches."

153
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:35,627
- It could be in the middle.

154
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:36,749
- True.

155
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:37,939
Yeah, mid.

156
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:39,459
- Okay, mid.

157
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:41,901
No, you have to say

158
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,138
where the other food is.

159
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:46,748
- I put it to high splash.

160
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:48,607
- Okay, you go, then you go.

161
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,136
- Guys look, too much heart.

162
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:12,377
One that was lower than...

163
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,017
negative four.

164
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,657
And this is negative four.

165
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,312
- [Teacher] What do we have?

166
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,824
Margo, did you finish your graph?

167
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:36,895
Excellent.

168
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,726
How are you doing on yours, Joshua?

169
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:42,840
You finished?

170
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,700
- I'm on Friday.

171
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,812
- You're on Friday.

172
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,134
So, maybe you two should start setting

173
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,165
up your circle.

174
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,033
Pick your question, Margo.

175
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:57,138
Joshua.

176
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:00,685
And this is your question.

177
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,345
And set up your circle right on there.

178
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,575
Grab your graph and a chair.

179
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,952
And sit in your circle
off to the side there.

180
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:23,782
- I think it's either low or splash.

181
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,091
- No, not splash.

182
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:26,440
- Not splash.

183
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,020
Otherwise there wouldn't be anything.

184
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,090
- Lower mid.

185
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,110
- I'd think low.

186
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,161
- No.

187
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,253
- No, remember at the aquarium,

188
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,013
they were underwater completely.

189
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,503
No things sticking out.

190
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:43,776
- Only some of the spine.

191
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:45,326
- Yeah, but the rest,

192
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:46,796
it was just...

193
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,128
boom there.

194
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:53,674
- I am doing it.

195
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:57,096
I'm doing the sand dollar for my...

196
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,086
report.

197
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,466
And it's high.

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,900
- No, remember at the aquarium also,

199
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,710
it was at the bottom of the tank.

200
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,132
Remember?

201
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,156
- [Student] No, it was at mid.

202
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,685
I remember, I checked.

203
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,335
And also anyways...

204
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,845
I'm doing the sand dollar.

205
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,165
- Okay.

206
00:10:20,976 --> 00:10:21,726
- [Teacher] Okay,

207
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:24,376
so Margo, do you have
your question with you?

208
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,900
So, everybody gets a chance

209
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,340
to converse and talk about

210
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,710
the answers to that question.

211
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,211
Or maybe you might realize something

212
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:35,260
or come to a realization
about your information.

213
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,530
And all of you can
contribute to the answer.

214
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,410
Okay?

215
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:39,673
So, go ahead.

216
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:44,879
- Were there any patterns you noticed

217
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,129
doing your graph?

218
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:47,429
What are they?

219
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,079
- I noticed that first it went

220
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:56,509
to medium then it went lower

221
00:10:58,131 --> 00:11:00,661
and then it went higher and higher

222
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:03,918
the third, fourth, and fifth time.

223
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:09,235
- My pattern was that each time...

224
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:14,106
each level started
getting higher and higher

225
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,956
and higher and so it's really high.

226
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:23,576
- Mine would go to 12, to 12,

227
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:26,216
then it would go to 11,

228
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:27,427
and then it went down to 10

229
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,405
and then it went down to nine.

230
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:31,615
It went lower and lower.

231
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:33,425
- [Student] And it was kinda like a mix.

232
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:39,065
- Monday and Tuesday were the same

233
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,805
and then it started going higher

234
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:42,936
and higher and higher,

235
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,016
all the way.

236
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,087
- What was unexpected?

237
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:53,947
I'll go first.

238
00:11:54,497 --> 00:11:58,178
It went lower than the average

239
00:11:58,178 --> 00:11:59,608
on the chart.

240
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:04,494
It went lower and then it started

241
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:06,324
going higher and higher.

242
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:14,738
- I thought it was just gonna stay

243
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,998
in the negative parts

244
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,498
but it actually went up to the nine.

245
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:22,752
- [Student] In mine,

246
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:25,802
I expected it to be some different levels,

247
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:27,230
but it kept going higher and higher

248
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,365
and higher and then when it started

249
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,895
to go even higher it just
kind of stayed the same.

250
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:36,852
- Mine went higher and higher and higher

251
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:38,882
and higher again.

252
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:42,138
Okay, who's next?

253
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:44,224
- [Student] I am.

254
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,001
Unless you want to go.

255
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,311
Read your question.

256
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:51,954
- What was your highest tide?

257
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,184
What was your lowest one?

258
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:58,332
My highest was Tuesday and Friday.

259
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:01,602
They were both negative one.

260
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:03,992
And Friday and Thursday,

261
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,103
they were both negatives.

262
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:09,973
Everything was negative.

263
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,703
- [Teacher] Everything
was negative on yours?

264
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,163
Wow!

265
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,445
Negative.

266
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:17,305
- Even one below the negatives.

267
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,465
You have five negative.

268
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,425
Negative five.

269
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:20,073
- [Teacher] Yeah, that's right

270
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:20,875
because you're grabbing,

271
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,591
you don't realize you'll
get a negative five.

272
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,941
- That tide's really low.

273
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:26,961
- [Teacher] Very low tide level, yeah.

274
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:28,911
Margo has her hand up, go ahead Margo.

275
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:32,426
- On the day that was highest, was Friday.

276
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,487
It went all the way up to nine.

277
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:40,033
And my lowest was Monday and Tuesday

278
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,583
because they're both negative one.

279
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,663
- Oh, and my lowest was Thursday.

280
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:49,433
(mumbles)

281
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,608
- Thursday and it was 9.

282
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:00,864
- [Teacher] Thursday and it was nine?

283
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:01,533
- Yeah.

284
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,543
- [Teacher] And Maia what
was your lowest tide?

285
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,505
- My lowest was Monday.

286
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:07,895
It was about at eight

287
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,588
and then it starts going higher

288
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,868
and my highest was at 12.

289
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,161
- So, I'm wondering now

290
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,671
if we look at all of our charts,

291
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:19,941
all of our graphs,

292
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,681
who had the highest tide of everybody?

293
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,781
Who had the highest?

294
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,961
So, you had a 12.

295
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,251
- I had two twelves.

296
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:30,261
- No, she had 11.

297
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,397
- So, it looks like maybe Callen and Maia

298
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,887
have close to each having a 12.

299
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,634
- I have the lowest score.

300
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,003
I have the lowest.

301
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,214
I think Joshua got the lowest

302
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:46,354
with a negative five reading

303
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:47,424
on his.

304
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,831
Anybody else have a negative five?

305
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,861
- No.

306
00:14:49,911 --> 00:14:52,241
I have a negative one.

307
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,099
But no negative fives.

308
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:55,980
- [Teacher] Okay, alright.

309
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,659
So, whose question's next?

310
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,940
Alright, I'll be right back.
