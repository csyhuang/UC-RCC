1
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:04,415
- But you're putting
children in your sweatshops.

2
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:07,782
- How are you gonna get more money?

3
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:12,438
How are you gonna finance
the country still?

4
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:14,678
- Both of you need to listen to Cambodia.

5
00:00:14,678 --> 00:00:15,746
Because Cambodia...

6
00:00:15,746 --> 00:00:17,325
- I am awesome, Cambodia is awesome!

7
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:18,417
- What are you doing to fix this?

8
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,272
- Well, for the money
problem, I'm not really sure,

9
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:25,545
but you can get loans for
other wealthier countries

10
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:33,709
and then as you're getting
better, pay 'em off and then for,

11
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:36,601
and then for child labor, you make a law

12
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,575
that kids have to go to school and learn,

13
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:43,516
so that way they can get
better skills and stuff.

14
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:45,188
And then put their, after that works

15
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:54,916
and everything to age laws.

16
00:00:54,916 --> 00:01:01,620
I'm the only one with an answer!

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,819
- I have no child labor whatsoever.

18
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:07,199
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought we discussed

19
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,453
that you do have child labor, but...

20
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:10,636
- Well, we do have some child labor

21
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:14,560
but it's more the grits going in

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,746
and making your child choose
the forms to get hired.

23
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:25,925
- So, what do I win as the
only one with an answer?

24
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,845
- How did you pull your
country off child labor?

25
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:29,865
You need to be giving them
suggestions and ideas,

26
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:34,358
OK, what can we do, what
can we do to crack...

27
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:36,970
- You told us some
solutions the other day.

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,084
- Right, so that's why you guys are

29
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:40,058
supposed to be discussing now.

30
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,210
- OK.

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,440
China do you wanna go ahead and...

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,741
- So, China, you know how to get rid of

33
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:45,134
all your child labor in your country?

34
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,479
You have a plan, you have
your whole plan in place...

35
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,408
- Pretty much.

36
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,940
- What's the first step,
what's the second step,

37
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,053
what's the third step,
what you're gonna do.

38
00:01:52,053 --> 00:01:53,539
- Yeah, you wanna hear it?

39
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,644
- I do.

40
00:01:56,644 --> 00:02:00,092
- First, we'll make it illegal
for children to work all day.

41
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:03,430
And the other half they go to school...

42
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,659
- OK, but wait a minute,
but don't your parents,

43
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,447
your families depend on that income

44
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,747
that those children are bringing in?

45
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:10,326
- Yes, but if they work half the day,

46
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:12,369
while they're at school,
they still earn money.

47
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,622
- But then they're
losing half their income.

48
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:18,805
- But then on weekends they can.

49
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,972
- But they work weekends
right now, anyway.

50
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:22,349
- Maybe we could establish
a minimum wage over there.

51
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,444
- Oh! Now there's an idea!

52
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,090
- What?

53
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,855
- They could establish a minimum wage.

54
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,988
- Yeah.

55
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,892
- OK, so you're gonna
establish a minimum wage.

56
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:36,552
- Yes, and going to
school to get a education

57
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:38,838
helps them get better
jobs when they're employed

58
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:42,961
so they can get more
money with better jobs,

59
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,943
so then they don't have that issue...

60
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,638
- So what are you going
to do in the process,

61
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:49,908
because you are gonna have to have

62
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,909
children leaving the workforce,

63
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,337
just starting to get their education

64
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,493
that takes several years for that

65
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,467
generation to become educated,

66
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:01,017
what are you gonna do in that gap?

67
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:04,463
You still have to have a plan
for those 12, 13, 14 years.

68
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:07,829
- What about programs
like those they used in

69
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,057
like the de, de,
depression, that's the word!

70
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:13,031
- OK, that's what you
guys should be discussing,

71
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,609
those are some of the things
you should be coming up with.

72
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:15,747
- They could start...

73
00:03:15,747 --> 00:03:17,256
- Keep in mind that needs money.

74
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:19,895
- But then they would get
loans from wealthier countries,

75
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,452
and as they're getting
stronger and more...

76
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,910
- OK, take those ideas and work with them.

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:33,246
You guys are on the right
track, you're rolling with it.

78
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:43,578
- So, put that down,
establish a minimum wage...

79
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:46,996
- OK, Cameroon, what was your solution...

80
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:50,014
- Say the children stop
working, and the adults get it,

81
00:03:50,014 --> 00:04:17,079
well it would be taking
money away from the family.

82
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,832
Not other than the ones
we came up with on Friday,

83
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,476
like have countries send money.

84
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:24,286
- What about that like education

85
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:27,347
like half school half work
campaign, it's like where

86
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:31,669
where you're working, part of your wages

87
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,808
pay for your school and
then you take the rest home

88
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:38,979
- And then, like, with me, in my country,

89
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,067
48% of working children
already go to school.

90
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:49,612
So, I guess all those times you mentioned.

91
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:52,023
But they only go for like six years,

92
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:55,355
from age 7 to...

93
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:58,736
Wait, I don't know.

94
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,315
- [Student in blue] OK, anyway,

95
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:21,582
that would help with
like the country being...

96
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:30,731
- France for the win!

97
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:41,295
Like the same thing but more...

98
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:45,493
- Coffee, OK, if it was our major export

99
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:48,762
it would get rid of
poverty and many things.

100
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:52,755
- Where's your country?

101
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:56,006
Where's your country?

102
00:05:56,006 --> 00:05:58,700
OK, never mind.

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,983
I was thinking you move
at the same time, but no.

104
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:12,753
- If we work together with
the coffee export, like...

105
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:26,755
If we combine the export...

106
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:35,462
If we produce...

107
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,875
Well, I meant like from whatever we sell,

108
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,452
we could try to hawk them together,

109
00:06:41,452 --> 00:07:03,232
to help each other create
better education...

110
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:06,140
- Y'all can combine your profits

111
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:33,353
in coffee, and begin making schools.

112
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:34,885
- You have an industry that brings in

113
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:36,813
a lot of potential money, correct?

114
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:37,625
- Right.

115
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,879
- OK, but remember, you don't sell

116
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,295
that product to the customers,

117
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,548
you're selling it to the businesses.

118
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:46,286
But that's bringing money
in to your businesses.

119
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:50,024
It's the businesses that hire
people and you create jobs.

120
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:53,600
So you need to figure out a way to take

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,244
that industry, that product and expand it,

122
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:02,791
so that it's bringing more
money and bringing more jobs.

123
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,507
Which is gonna help because
then you'll have adults,

124
00:08:05,507 --> 00:08:07,528
you have 45% income.

125
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,755
- We can combine it so that children

126
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:14,493
who are of suitable ages can have jobs.

127
00:08:14,493 --> 00:08:18,586
- What would be a suitable age?

128
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:19,321
- Eighteen.

129
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:20,598
- Eighteen?

130
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,197
This mine is not an easy job, is it?

131
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:26,913
It's hard work, it's dangerous down there.

132
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:32,834
To have twelve-year-old kids down there...

133
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:35,109
- You're still United Nations, correct?

134
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:37,269
Is that gonna be agreeable to you?

135
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,150
You can create laws that forbid

136
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:45,034
businesses from running her product.

137
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:47,332
So whatever she suggests to you,

138
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,608
you have to make sure
that that's OK, because,

139
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,600
remember, you can tell her,
sorry it's not gonna happen.

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:09:01,388
- Yup.

141
00:09:01,388 --> 00:09:02,712
- Which means you have more money

142
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:04,634
going out than coming in, correct?

143
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,654
So you need to figure
out a way to change that.

144
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:08,488
You need some money coming in.

145
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:10,973
So what are the strengths
your country has?

146
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:13,527
That you could potentially build and grow,

147
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:26,155
when she's got the diamonds.

148
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:31,395
- I saw a pendant on the internet,
and it had like, a string

149
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:35,789
and there was like three fat
fond doves on one string.

150
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,900
- OK, that's a factory purchase,
but what you could make...

151
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,154
- I don't know.

152
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:45,178
- That's what you need to know.

153
00:09:45,178 --> 00:09:46,873
What does your economy depend on?

154
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:51,501
I mean, you have to produce something.

155
00:09:51,501 --> 00:09:58,227
- It says making foreign...

156
00:09:58,227 --> 00:10:18,660
OK, I have a question, what
is a "foreign exchange?"

157
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,028
- It's Nestea's largest exporter,

158
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:28,458
so you are exporting product.

159
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:36,020
So you do have some products
that you're exporting.

160
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,668
Oh, you're Taiwan?

161
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:46,576
You have a lot of textile
factories, you make clothing.

162
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:53,488
Your country's the one that's
got all the sweatshops.

163
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:59,912
So that's what you need,
you need to build...

164
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:03,604
You should be suggesting
some ideas to her.

165
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:06,715
Giving her ideas, say, OK,
you've got a product to export,

166
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,596
but you need to do this, and you need to

167
00:11:08,596 --> 00:11:28,606
do this, and you need to do this.

168
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,464
- [Student in green] They
need to find some way to pay.

169
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:34,226
- Exactly.

170
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,360
- Wait, I have a question
for the United Nations.

171
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,100
OK, how you said, setting up your steps,

172
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,304
well if there's not a lot of educated people,

173
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,603
then how are they gonna find teachers?

174
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:49,794
- Well, if you said, exactly...

175
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,975
Well, first...

176
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:54,133
- You could hire people from...

177
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,549
- Different countries.

178
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,776
Maybe if you like hired somebody

179
00:11:58,776 --> 00:12:02,841
from like the US that's educated,

180
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:06,648
they could do administry of helping

181
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:11,193
like educating adults and
then they're educated.

182
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:12,795
They're doing the same
thing that kids are,

183
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,419
they've been in child labor and stuff,

184
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,346
plus when they got older,
they're just working again,

185
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,459
so they haven't really changed anything,

186
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:24,800
so to change that, I
guess, maybe if you got

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,233
other countries to come and educate them

188
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:34,784
and then after that
they could the educate the children.

189
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:38,831
So you couldn't get the
kids out of the work so fast

190
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,968
because you still have to
educate all the teachers.

191
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,935
And the kids have no where to go.

192
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:46,912
- Well, I say, since
they're already adults, that

193
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:50,651
we kinda like, work on the
children more with education.

194
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:56,000
I guess because the children are small.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,350
- So, before you even take
the kids out of these places

196
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,113
You have to get all the
people, and you have to...

197
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,899
So you have to figure out some, like,

198
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,314
you're gonna have to figure out a timespan

199
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:11,404
of how long that's gonna take.

200
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:27,012
It's basically, you're taking,
elementary schools you like.

201
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:30,905
- I mean, they could set up a scholarship.

202
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:34,833
That way they could go from like...

203
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,322
- And even, your country could help pay,

204
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:42,146
help pay the people that are teaching.

205
00:13:42,146 --> 00:13:44,148
Because in the long run, you're gaining,

206
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:50,765
that money's gonna be spent...

207
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:53,456
- The population is gonna face it,

208
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:56,152
they get the cotton for the clothes,

209
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:59,507
and get the food for their
teachers and all that.

210
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:19,807
- If we can help poverty...

211
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,668
To help pay for some schools.

212
00:14:22,668 --> 00:14:43,092
- Yes, that would be amazing.

213
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,821
- We could also have all the adults work

214
00:14:44,821 --> 00:14:51,361
the rest of their life,
like, insanely or something.

215
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:52,801
- I'm the government, I can say,

216
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,215
hey, there's laws now that
a kid's gotta go to school,

217
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:59,075
and he can't work so many days of work,

218
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:01,073
so many hours of work.
