1
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:03,748
- Does everyone agree
on the first question?

2
00:00:03,748 --> 00:00:04,108
- Yeah.

3
00:00:04,108 --> 00:00:05,326
- What did you all agree on?

4
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:08,805
- That it wasn't really fair for--

5
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:12,925
- For First and Second Class to go through

6
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:14,225
without any problems,

7
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:16,044
and the people from the Steerage

8
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:18,151
had to go through examinations,

9
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,364
and this whole, long hassle.

10
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:21,853
- And why was that?

11
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:23,468
Why did people who were
First and Second Class

12
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,011
just get to come right on in

13
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:26,265
and not have to go through examinations?

14
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:27,705
- Cause of the money.

15
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:28,412
- What about the money?

16
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:31,930
- Because they thought that they had--

17
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,510
they were perfect.

18
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:33,463
They had no disease.

19
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:34,412
They had lots of money,

20
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:35,762
and thought they would work hard.

21
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:37,595
- So the stereotype is, what?

22
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:40,823
- That rich people are
more-- can work harder,

23
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:44,841
or have less chance of disease

24
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,261
than the people in Steerage.

25
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:49,181
- Do you think that that
stereotype is still true today?

26
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,691
Or do you think it's not true anymore?

27
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:53,291
It was just for First and
Second Class passengers

28
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,835
for Steerage passengers before emigrating?

29
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:58,074
- Well, it's kind of like this.

30
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:02,470
It's not over-the-top, but
it's just a little bit.

31
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,138
- What do you guys think about
what Eric said?

32
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:06,784
- I agree with him.

33
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:10,600
- Why?

34
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,450
- It's not fair because
First and Second Class

35
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,581
usually are kings or royalty,

36
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:22,352
and so if you're in Steerage,
you're just a normal person.

37
00:01:22,352 --> 00:01:24,207
If you're in Steerage,
it's not going to be fair.

38
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:26,702
You have to go walk through that and--

39
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,700
- Well, First and Second Class Passengers

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,987
they weren't necessarily royalty,

41
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:32,813
they were just people
who had a lot of money.

42
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,954
People who had enough money to buy

43
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:37,140
those tickets which they
were really expensive.

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,522
What do you guys think
about what Eric said?

45
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:41,333
That the stereotype today is still here,

46
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,053
but not really?

47
00:01:42,053 --> 00:01:44,903
Just kind of back-and-forth?

48
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:48,130
- It's back-and-forth.

49
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,064
They don't do the same thing anymore.

50
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:58,028
- Who's "they"? And
what's the "same thing"?

51
00:01:58,028 --> 00:02:00,297
- The American Embassy.

52
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:02,786
The people that take
care of the immigrants

53
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:07,882
and everything, and all about them.

54
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:10,320
They don't go to Ellis Island anymore.

55
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,661
- They don't go to Ellis Island anymore.

56
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:15,023
- You have to go on a plane,

57
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:18,587
or you have to drive here.

58
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,723
- But do you think the
stereotype, in general,

59
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,441
that rich people are better

60
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,821
or they don't have diseases,
and they're just better

61
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:27,061
than people who don't have a lot of money?

62
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,105
Do you think we still have
those stereotypes today?

63
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,786
[calls on student]

64
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:31,521
- Sometimes.

65
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,947
- Sometimes? Have you seen it ever?

66
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:33,432
- No.

67
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,537
- No, but you just think it's still there?

68
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:36,188
- I haven't really seen it at all.

69
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,347
- Yeah, I agree with (inaudible).

70
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:40,163
- Okay. You can start the next one.

71
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,805
Hold on. Josh, did you
have something else to add?

72
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:47,390
- Yeah. On TV shows, sometimes they have

73
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,878
rich people

74
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,383
in huge carriages

75
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:51,489
with horses sometimes.

76
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,667
- And they're usually pretty snotty.

77
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,181
- And how do you know they're snotty?

78
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:58,103
- They're always like, "Don't touch that!

79
00:02:58,103 --> 00:03:00,490
"It's going to fall and
you're going to pay for that!"

80
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,549
- Oh, okay. So you do see in TV sometimes?

81
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,754
- Yeah.

82
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:05,615
- All right.

83
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:08,006
- Do you think immigrants
were treated fairly

84
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:11,976
at Ellis Island?

85
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,266
Why or why not?

86
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,882
- I don't think they
were treated very fairly,

87
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:23,156
because they had to go through (inaudible).

88
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,363
- I agree with Jacob

89
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:28,121
because sometimes

90
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:33,370
people just sent them
back at Ellis Island,

91
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,692
but some doctors at least
tried to keep us here

92
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,097
to help us be better until
we got to stay in America.

93
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:44,311
- Yeah, and that was good

94
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:47,945
that the doctors are
supposed to check them

95
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:51,124
and see if they were okay.

96
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:54,132
- Some of the doctors,

97
00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:56,582
two people could have the same diseases,

98
00:03:56,582 --> 00:03:59,244
but both the doctors--

99
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,674
one doctor could send one person home,

100
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:06,094
and one person could stay at
Ellis Island which is unfair.

101
00:04:06,094 --> 00:04:08,260
- Possibly because of their religion

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,316
or the way-- their language?

103
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:15,549
- I think they were mostly--

104
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,979
- I think they were mostly, yeah.

105
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,258
- So they were mostly treated
well, but sometimes not?

106
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,456
- Sometimes not.

107
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:24,738
- Yeah.

108
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,919
- The doctors or the
inspectors might think

109
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,759
that one person can stay
because of their religion

110
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,918
or their language and others
might have to be sent back.

111
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,858
- And remember the book that we read?

112
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:45,917
It kind of said that--

113
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,149
the cousin, he had to be sent back to--

114
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,699
well, he almost had to be sent back

115
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:52,049
to his country because--

116
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:52,279
- To Russia.

117
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:55,108
- Yeah, to Russia,
because he had a scratch

118
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:58,754
and they thought it was infected.

119
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:02,203
His father was trying to tell him,

120
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,312
but they didn't listen.

121
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:06,128
- Yeah. He didn't.

122
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,355
- [Student] I think they
should have translators

123
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:10,824
with all of them, so then
it would make it fair.

124
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:13,749
- That spoke English, and that language.

125
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:14,900
- That language.

126
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,912
So they can understand things.

127
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:20,452
- So I would say, mostly.

128
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:24,502
- Yeah. Mostly.

129
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:27,025
- So should we check them both off?

130
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:30,898
- I think we should
check off the first one.

131
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:31,748
- [Another Student] If they
were sick or something,

132
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,979
or if they needed food,

133
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,707
they had places where they could get food.

134
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:38,900
Or if they were sick and
had to go to the hospital,

135
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,813
like Sophia said.

136
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:45,508
So I'm in the middle. Kind of.

137
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:46,866
Because sometimes, they
were treated badly.

138
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:50,592
- I agree with Josh
because if they were sick,

139
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:53,344
they would probably be treated less fairly

140
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,654
because they were sick
and had their diseases.

141
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:56,701
Like, "Oh! Get away from me,

142
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:57,683
because you're going to spread

143
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,253
that disease to everybody.

144
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:01,238
It's going to be an epidemic."

145
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:02,968
- I want to add,

146
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:04,384
if they were sick,

147
00:06:04,384 --> 00:06:07,373
they could have been contagious,

148
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,262
and there were a lot of
people at Ellis Island

149
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,806
so they might have--

150
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:16,364
- Usually if they were at a hospital,

151
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:18,271
they were curing curable diseases,

152
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:19,850
because if they couldn't cure it--

153
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,730
they didn't have a medicine
or anything to cure that,

154
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,111
they got sent back.

155
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:29,882
- Yeah, I agree with Eric and Sophia...

156
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,531
- Go ahead. Were you
going to say something?

157
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:36,945
- I was going to say, if
we all agree on this...

158
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:39,902
- So your general feeling here is:

159
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:42,038
were they treated fairly at Ellis Island?

160
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:45,845
- They weren't treated not very fairly.

161
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,703
Like they were treated half the fair

162
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:48,725
that they should have been,

163
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,885
but they weren't treated really good.

164
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:53,233
- They were fed very well,

165
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,451
and all their needs were there,

166
00:06:55,451 --> 00:07:01,103
but they weren't treated

167
00:07:01,103 --> 00:07:04,329
very good like if you were on
an airplane in First Class.

168
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,162
- It's kind of like--

169
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:09,493
- I would like to add,

170
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,303
they were treated way better

171
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,021
in Ellis Island because on the ship,

172
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,622
in Steerage, they didn't have good food.

173
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:19,198
They couldn't really bathe,
and it was all crowded.

174
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:20,858
They didn't really have
a good place to sleep,

175
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:24,399
but in Ellis Island, they
actually had okay food.

176
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,835
They weren't treated like (inaudible).

177
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:27,841
- Do you think that it was fair

178
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:29,209
that they each had to have

179
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:32,717
$20 on them in order to stay?

180
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:33,151
- Yeah.

181
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:37,406
- Sort of. Sort of.

182
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:39,947
- What I think is they need
to take care of themselves

183
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:43,867
and

184
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,373
America is actually bringing

185
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,230
lots of them over here.

186
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,207
America just could say, "Stop.

187
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:52,624
No more immigrants, at all,"

188
00:07:52,624 --> 00:07:55,424
but they've been letting people in.

189
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:59,158
A lot of people in,

190
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:02,556
and they've been very generous

191
00:08:02,556 --> 00:08:05,337
by giving them food,

192
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:08,156
and letting them live here

193
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:11,501
in this wonderful country.

194
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,679
So they've provided enough.

195
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,095
- I have something-- I
have two things to say.

196
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,110
I agree with Sophia because--

197
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,247
I sort of agree with Sophia

198
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,984
because if they didn't have $20,

199
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:27,349
they wouldn't have much to live,

200
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,009
and the government

201
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,006
is not really responsible
for the immigrants.

202
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,271
They're responsible for themselves.

203
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,827
They're on their own,

204
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,736
and I would like to say is that,

205
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,824
going back to Sophia's (inaudible).

206
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:45,069
It said that--

207
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,776
then they were fed well,
and that they were...

208
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,347
- All wanted to get to America,

209
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,274
and even if some of them had money,

210
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:52,994
how do you know

211
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,654
that they didn't have
a disease or something?

212
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:56,948
How do you know if they
didn't have lice or something?

213
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:57,986
- I kind of agree with you,

214
00:08:57,986 --> 00:09:01,653
because if they paid more,

215
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:05,260
I think they shouldn't
get a lot, a lot more,

216
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,907
but I think they should
get a little bit more,

217
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:10,693
but they still should go to Ellis Island.

218
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:11,819
- Yeah.

219
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,656
- Sometimes they did have doctors

220
00:09:13,656 --> 00:09:15,096
who came on the ships,

221
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,800
and kind of gave the medical exams

222
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,832
to First and Second Class Passengers

223
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,318
to make sure they didn't
have any diseases.

224
00:09:21,318 --> 00:09:24,441
And then if their medical
exams checked out fine,

225
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:26,466
then they could skip everything else.

226
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,553
So they didn't have to get
asked all those questions,

227
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:34,034
and they didn't have to wait
in all those long lines,

228
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:36,066
and things like that.

229
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,215
So what do you think about that?

230
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:39,932
- I think it's still unfair

231
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:41,546
that they didn't have
to wait in long lines

232
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:45,351
just because they were
already examined on the boat.

233
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,261
- I think instead of Ellis Island,

234
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:48,324
they should have checked them

235
00:09:48,324 --> 00:09:51,226
before they got on the boat, for everyone.

236
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:54,839
- Yeah. I agree with you.

237
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,625
- I think they got all seasick.

238
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,482
Think that's where they all got sick?

239
00:09:58,482 --> 00:09:59,620
- Yeah.

240
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,618
- Like in the Steerage.

241
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:02,963
Some of them got sick because
they were in Steerage,

242
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:04,646
and then when they got to Ellis Island,

243
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,585
they had to get sent back.

244
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,441
- The reason why some of them got sick,

245
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:13,719
was because they didn't have fresh air,

246
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,892
and so they couldn't breathe that well.

247
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:20,171
- Stuffy in Steerage.

248
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:24,364
- I think all doctors should have been

249
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:28,025
actually fair instead of sending

250
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,075
some immigrants back

251
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:32,176
just because they don't like them,

252
00:10:32,176 --> 00:10:35,719
for their religion and stuff.

253
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,338
- Could doctors send people back

254
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,405
because they didn't like their religion?

255
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,373
Doctors could send people back, why?

256
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:44,273
Doctors couldn't send people back,

257
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:45,817
but they would mark letters on your back.

258
00:10:45,817 --> 00:10:47,535
Why could they mark letters on your back?

259
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,970
- Because they probably thought--

260
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,440
they probably saw something different

261
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,420
when it was actually a scratch.

262
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,108
- So, just if you were hurt,

263
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:58,336
and then they had to go through

264
00:10:58,336 --> 00:11:00,253
further medical exams to see,

265
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:01,381
but doctors couldn't just say,

266
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:03,481
"I don't like you! You have to go back!"

267
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:08,177
They were just examining you

268
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,965
to make sure you didn't
have a contagious disease

269
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:10,976
that could get other people sick.

270
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:11,518
- When we were reading,

271
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:19,804
they said something about the doctors--

272
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,268
where they didn't have
any diseases or anything,

273
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:24,660
but they'd still send them back.

274
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,378
- And you read that in the book?

275
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:28,758
- We were reading one of the things.

276
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,325
- Oh, and why would they send them back?

277
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:32,624
Why would they get sent back,

278
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,888
by the legal inspectors and other people?

279
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:38,479
- Sometimes, it was like
there were random reasons

280
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,609
they sent them.

281
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,175
- Just because?

282
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:40,548
- Yeah.

283
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:42,056
- That's not fair? That's
what you're saying?

284
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:49,300
- Yeah.

285
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,507
- I'd also change the
part where they had to--

286
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,752
why did they have to mark
stuff on their own clothes?

287
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:57,925
- Yeah.

288
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,770
- I mean they should have
given a sheet or something.

289
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,443
- Or something.

290
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:02,881
Because, what if that's
the only thing they had?

291
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:04,161
You know?

292
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:06,251
- I think they should mark on their skin,

293
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,071
or something so then you
could just wash it off.

294
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,203
- Like a marker or something?

295
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:13,392
- No, I don't think they
should do it on the skin,

296
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,948
because then if there
was a water fountain,

297
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:15,945
they could just wash it off

298
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,105
and say, "I'm in this line." Right?

299
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:18,907
- True.

300
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:21,560
- [Student] They could.
They could do that.

301
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,340
We all agree they should do something

302
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,810
other than your own clothes.

303
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,411
- They should give you
a sheet of paper and--

304
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,034
- You could rip it apart.

305
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:32,794
[background chatter]

306
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:33,891
- I think that they way they did it,

307
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:37,234
for example, that guy in the
book did his jacket inside-out.

308
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:39,789
They should have been kind of more smart

309
00:12:39,789 --> 00:12:41,053
about what they gave them.

310
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,169
Because someone could just say,

311
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,548
"Take this jacket inside-out,"

312
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,372
and then go into the other line.

313
00:12:46,372 --> 00:12:49,191
- Or he could just put
his jacket on tomorrow.

314
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:51,223
- Yeah. "Oh, I don't have a jacket."

315
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:51,944
- Yeah.

316
00:12:51,944 --> 00:13:04,390
- Yeah.

317
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,882
- If we didn't have Ellis Island,

318
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,890
not as many immigrants
would be here, probably,

319
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,503
because it'd be a lot harder.

320
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,545
And Ellis Island,

321
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,689
they fed you food.

322
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:22,054
It was good. I like it.

323
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:24,883
- I agree with Josh

324
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:32,062
because

325
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:36,185
they gave you food and water,

326
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:41,652
a place to sleep.

327
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:44,299
They built stuff and made kinder-cares,

328
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,818
and made stuff with the little kids

329
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:52,880
and stuff for the grown-ups.

330
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,979
The people that were there at Ellis Island

331
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,255
didn't even have to pay for any of that.

332
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:00,464
That was all for free.

333
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,948
I mean, imagine that happening to us

334
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:06,447
right now?

335
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:07,946
That will never happen.

336
00:14:07,946 --> 00:14:09,698
- I definitely agree with Sophia

337
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:14,005
because if you just come to Ellis Island,

338
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:16,698
and they just give you
potato soup every meal,

339
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:19,206
it's kind of like they don't get

340
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,448
a good impression of America.

341
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:23,479
I think they try to give a good impression

342
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,522
for the immigrants on America,

343
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:26,880
from giving them good food,

344
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,202
and a good way to start
their time in America.

345
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,022
and then they realize
how complicated it is.

346
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:33,380
- Yeah.

347
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,098
- According to everyone, I kind of agree.

348
00:14:36,098 --> 00:14:38,000
It was good, I think.
