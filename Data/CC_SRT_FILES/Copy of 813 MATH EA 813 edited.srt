1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,171
- Two times two--

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:06,594
- Aggregating rules,
smaller the denominator,

3
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:07,592
the bigger the fraction.

4
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:10,419
- That don't work sometimes.

5
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,239
- I know what you're thinking.

6
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:15,732
- Six eighths, okay.

7
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:18,541
- One, two, three.

8
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,632
- Hey, look.

9
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:23,591
- Four, five, six.

10
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,959
- You know it's like division, too.

11
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,236
- Yeah, that's--

12
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,815
- Okay, six eighths?

13
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:29,872
- Versus what?

14
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:32,112
Six eighths versus three fourths?

15
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:33,076
- Okay.

16
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,736
- One, two, three, four, five, six.

17
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:37,568
- They're equal, they're equal.

18
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:42,568
- One, two, three.

19
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:47,558
- They're equal.

20
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:52,254
- I just did that.

21
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:53,797
- They're equal.

22
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:55,330
- Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,932
Wait.

24
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:58,488
- That's what I said,
didn't you hear me say that?

25
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:00,414
I said if you do equivalent fraciton--

26
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,634
- It is.

27
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:03,456
- Divide by two.

28
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:04,873
- Can we do it the easy way?

29
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:07,752
- Nah, cause this is basically
the easy way, I mean, look--

30
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:10,526
- Okay, what if we didn't have tiles?

31
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:11,490
- What if we didn't have--

32
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,069
- Imagine if we didn't have tiles.

33
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,671
We'd have paper and pen.

34
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:18,026
People back in the days,
they never had colorful--

35
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,695
- They didn't have a pencil, neither.

36
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:23,075
- Oh, yeah, well, you know
what I'm talking about.

37
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:27,324
- They had clay and a pointy stick.

38
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:31,696
- All right, so, where's the paper?

39
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,533
You guys want to use a pen or pencil?

40
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,192
- I already got one.

41
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,608
- So, who wants to go first?

42
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:39,943
- I'll go first.

43
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:42,597
I will.

44
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:45,801
Okay, group members.

45
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:56,108
[Background Chatter]

46
00:01:57,728 --> 00:01:59,389
- I can't really explain it.

47
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:00,282
- You can't really explain it?

48
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:01,269
Then show me.

49
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:04,758
If I said, "four tenths" and "one third."

50
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,980
Okay, so then how do you know

51
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,582
that four tenths is bigger
than one third,

52
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:25,404
looking at those fraction bars?

53
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:30,083
- Because you add this and minus this.

54
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,219
It's...

55
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,077
It's one more than you need.

56
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:39,463
- No, because if you add
one tenth to one third,

57
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:40,879
it's still going to be bigger.

58
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,098
- Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,420
- All right, but just
looking at these two.

60
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,927
If I said "one third and four tenths,"

61
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:49,197
which one's bigger?

62
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,584
- Four tenths.

63
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,442
- Four tenths.  How do you
know by looking at them?

64
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:55,315
- Because...

65
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,191
Three, four.

66
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:02,564
Like, six.

67
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:04,341
- Four tenths.

68
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:07,858
It's wider than one third.

69
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,542
- Good, it's wider than one third.

70
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,840
So now you guys just finished
envelope number two,

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,059
and you guys have a couple questions

72
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,963
to answer about envelope number two.

73
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:16,600
Who's turn is it to write?

74
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
- Kayla.

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,701
- Kayla's?

76
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,083
So, why don't you read
the group question

77
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,464
for envelope number two?

78
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:23,136
- Without using the fraction tiles,

79
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,237
how could you explain to someone

80
00:03:25,237 --> 00:03:29,939
why five twelfths is
smaller than one half?

81
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:33,398
How could you explain it to them that

82
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,021
five eighths is bigger than one half?

83
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,461
- So, what about that question?

84
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:39,156
How would you explain to someone

85
00:03:39,156 --> 00:03:43,115
that five twelfths is
smaller than one half?

86
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:45,193
- Just like we told you,

87
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:50,193
it's because twelve, well,
twelve six is half of...

88
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,994
- Six twelve.

89
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,722
- Yeah, six twelve.

90
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:57,359
Is half of a twelve.

91
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,359
And five is just a little bit
smaller than six twelfths.

92
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,472
- Okay, very good.

93
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:09,920
What about, what about five
eighths is bigger than one half?

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,278
Israel, what do you think?

95
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:12,706
How would you explain to someone

96
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:16,246
why five eighths is bigger than one half?

97
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:17,303
- Five eighths?

98
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,997
- Yeah.  How could you explain to
someone that five eighths

99
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:23,224
is bigger than one half,
this question right here?

100
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:25,058
How would you explain to
someone that five eighths

101
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:26,417
is bigger than one half?

102
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:29,737
- Because like more eighths, one eighth,

103
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,604
is bigger than like one,

104
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:36,679
and like, more it adds one half,

105
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:39,303
and one half--

106
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:42,460
- So, what number would
eight as a denominator

107
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,445
would be exactly one half?

108
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,223
- Huh?

109
00:04:45,223 --> 00:04:47,440
- Which number, which fraction, with eight

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,545
as the denominator, would
be equal to one half?

111
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,774
- Four eighths.

112
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,590
- Why do you say four eighths?

113
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:02,032
- It's one half.

114
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:04,709
- Can you show me with
the fraction tiles?

115
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:07,060
- Didn't you say not to
use the fraction tiles?

116
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,335
- I know, but I want him to see

117
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:12,429
that he's right, that four
eighths is equal to one half.

118
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,239
Okay, guys, okay, good.

119
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,457
So, then, how would you explain
to somebody why five eighths

120
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:36,360
is bigger than one half?

121
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,360
- It's one more, one more you add to it.

122
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:44,951
- You know that one eighths
is equal to one half,

123
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,180
because they're like even numbers?

124
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,293
- One eighth is equal to one half?

125
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,452
- Four eighths, four eighths.

126
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,751
- That four eighths is equal to one half.

127
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:54,657
Okay.

128
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:55,817
All right, guys, keep on going.

129
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:57,489
Answer the questions
for envelope number two,

130
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:00,217
and you guys can get started
on envelope number three, okay?

131
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:05,070
[Background Chatter]

132
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,254
All right, guys.

133
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:08,274
So, you guys are on
envelope number one?

134
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:10,660
- Yeah.

135
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:13,533
We're done with envelope
one, we're just like

136
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:14,833
answering this question.

137
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,692
- You're doing what?

138
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:18,095
- We're done with envelope
one, but we're answering it.

139
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,453
- Okay, so what is the question

140
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,707
for envelope number one?

141
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,251
Anthony, can you read it?

142
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,772
- It is--

143
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:25,814
- Someone in the class said
that nine tenths was more

144
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,591
than one third, because
the bigger the number,

145
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,950
the smaller the fraction.

146
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,227
Are they correct?

147
00:06:30,227 --> 00:06:32,455
How would you explain to them

148
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:35,752
where they were correct or incorrect?

149
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:36,867
- So, that's something that I've heard

150
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,527
a lot of people in the class say.

151
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:40,872
That the bigger the denominator,

152
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:43,472
the smaller the fraction.

153
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:44,853
Is that always true?

154
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:46,014
- No.

155
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,046
- No, why?

156
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:52,573
- Well, because, well, the smaller

157
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:53,909
the denominator, that means like,

158
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:58,204
sometimes it could be like smaller,

159
00:06:58,204 --> 00:07:02,650
smaller, but sometimes, I think, like,

160
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,148
well, actually--

161
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:05,471
- You're doing good, keep on going.

162
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,548
- Well, since like, they're the whole--

163
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:09,964
- Okay.

164
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:14,503
- So, like, two pieces is two pieces,

165
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:17,208
one's shaving it all away and the other

166
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,588
one is for...

167
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:21,666
- So, what does the denominator
actually tell you

168
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,511
about a fraction?

169
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,426
- How many pieces the thing is cut into.

170
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,306
- How many pieces it's cut into.

171
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:30,790
What does a numerator
tell us about a fraction?

172
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,963
- How many are shaded.

173
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:33,228
- How many are shaded.

174
00:07:33,228 --> 00:07:37,443
So, then why, right here, why right here,

175
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:40,228
is nine tenths so much bigger,

176
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:41,900
or bigger than one third?

177
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,201
- Because it's close to one whole.

178
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,745
- Because it's close to one whole.

179
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:45,708
And how could you explain it with what

180
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:46,602
we just talked about?

181
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:47,368
Savannah?

182
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:51,745
- Because it's 10 is the
denominator and three is the other,

183
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:55,820
so if there's 10, that means
there's 10 of the small pieces,

184
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,141
and there's nine of the
small of those pieces.

185
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:59,326
- But there's nine of those pieces.

186
00:07:59,326 --> 00:08:01,044
So, how many of those
pieces are shaded in?

187
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:01,798
- Nine.

188
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:02,564
- Good.

189
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,679
And what about for one third?

190
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,547
How many pieces would we
shade in for one third?

191
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:06,442
- One.

192
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,278
- Good.

for the second question?

gonna say it exactly how she wrote it,

but we just, we all
agreed that if you keep--

- Simplifying.

- --simplifying a fraction,
into its lowest terms,

and if it can't go any lower, than like,

212
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:10,427
then it's one half or one third,

213
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:15,427
you'll know if, if it's
equivalent to one half.

- Or you can find a common denominator.

00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,441
- Pretty much, the same number.

and see how you order
these on the fraction line.

225
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,337
- Let's try one half first.

226
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:47,245
First, three fourths.

227
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,596
Wait.

228
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:50,675
- Wait.

229
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,952
- Yeah, three fourths goes right there,

230
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:54,413
five eighths goes right here.

231
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:57,391
No, no, it'll go right here.

232
00:09:57,652 --> 00:09:59,115
Wait.

233
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,996
It goes right here.

234
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,412
- So why don't you guys
use the fraction bars,

235
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:03,979
then, to figure it out?

236
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:07,740
- Because I know three
fourths is half of one--

237
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,890
- Three fourths is...

238
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,236
- Half of, wait.

239
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:11,955
- No, it would be more.

240
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,649
- It's half of--

241
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,693
- It would be more.

242
00:10:15,693 --> 00:10:16,795
It would be right here.

243
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:18,037
- Wait, I want you, I want you

244
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:19,129
to explain that a little
bit better for me.

245
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:21,451
You said that three fourths
is half of one half?

246
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,157
- I mean one fourth is half of one half.

247
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,817
- OK, one fourth is half of one half,

248
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,696
so what about three fourths, then?

249
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:28,950
- And three fourths would go right here,

250
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,690
because two fourths is equal to one half,

251
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,350
and three fourths would be in the middle

252
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,857
between one whole and one half.

253
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:37,088
- Right.

254
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:38,330
- Also, I was going to say that

255
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,813
since we all know one half is right here,

256
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,157
three fourths would go
in front of five eighths,

257
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:48,093
because one half of eight is four eighths,

258
00:10:48,093 --> 00:10:49,486
and then that goes right here

259
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:53,050
one half of fourths

260
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,593
is two fourths, and then,
that's not the same.

261
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:59,435
Three fourths of eight
would be six eighths.

262
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,190
- Good.

263
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,293
And how do you know that four over four

264
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,453
goes right over here?

265
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,112
- 'Cause it's one, it's one whole.

266
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:08,102
Wait.

267
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:11,427
No, that would be the same
place as three fourths.

268
00:11:11,427 --> 00:11:14,632
Wait, yeah, that would be the same place.

269
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,827
- Why would it be the same place?

270
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:16,791
- Because--

271
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,083
- Oh, it is.

272
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,434
- You said it's an equivalent fraction,

273
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,245
can you explain what they said?

274
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:24,371
Why did they say that three fourths

275
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:25,834
and six eighths are equivalent fractions?

276
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:28,423
- Because they're the same.

277
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:33,423
Because, because four times two is eight,

278
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,550
and three times two is six.

279
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,247
- Okay.

280
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,569
And why does that make two
fractions equivalent, then?

281
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:41,536
Could you show me using fraction tiles?

- We notice that they're
the same length.

- They're the same length.

300
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:05,238
- And, also, we know that

301
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:07,808
pretty much what Akosha said,

302
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,547
that if you multiply,

303
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:12,927
or if, yeah, if you multiply,

304
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:16,491
like, if you multiply three times two,

305
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,709
and four times two, it's six eighths,

306
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,670
because four times two is, yeah,

307
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,573
four times two is eight,
and three times two is six.

308

- Do you notice anything
else about it here?

309
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:30,410
- That two eighths equals one fourth.

310
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,966

- Yeah.

314
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,477
- How did you know that five twelfths

315
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,054
was less than one half?

316
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,074
Go ahead.

317
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:55,350
- Six is half of twelve,
and five twelfths is

318
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,876
lower than six twelfths.

319
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,141
- Okay.

320
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:01,306
Okay.

321
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:04,034
Why did you know that one
third is inbetween one fifth

322
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,043
and five twelfths?

323
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:11,043
- 'Cause, like we don't that
the smaller the denominator,

324
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:14,468
the bigger it is, and so, one fourth would

325
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:16,302
be in the middle.

326
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:18,008
So, that would be on the
other side of one fourth.

331
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,244
- We've over. It's over.

332
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,788
- So, which one are you guys on now?

333
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,400
- Four, but we need help with

334
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,186
one of the questions on three.

335
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:40,146
- Five, no, we need help on number four.

336
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,284
- Let's look at the question

337
00:14:41,284 --> 00:14:43,362
on number three that you
guys are stuck on, then.

338
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,208
- We're not.

339
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,658
We just have a question on what it is.

340
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:49,782
- A conjecture.

341
00:14:49,782 --> 00:14:51,024
- A conjecture.

342
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,079
So, conjecture is something that we,

343
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,785
we've talked about before in math.

344
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:57,282
If it says, "What conjecture,"
it's kind of like

345
00:14:57,282 --> 00:15:00,238
what a hypothesis is in science.
