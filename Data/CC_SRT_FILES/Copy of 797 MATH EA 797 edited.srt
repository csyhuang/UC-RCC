1
00:00:00,214 --> 00:00:02,838
- One eighth plus one eighth is [inaudible]

2
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:03,999
- Oh, one eighth, okay.

3
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,413
Is she adding one eighth
together a bunch of times?

4
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:08,248
Where do you see that?

5
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:09,483
Can you come up and show us?

6
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:16,681
- You have to get seven of them.

7
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:17,694
- Okay.

8
00:00:17,694 --> 00:00:20,341
Katriana could you add
that number sentence up

9
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,495
above your picture also?

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,242
So I like how you're all thinking
while she's writing this.

11
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:30,121
There's a couple different
ways we can represent this.

12
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,373
I think Anielli and
lots a groups had their

13
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:34,509
hand up were right that she did.

14
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:37,505
I can see she took seven
pizzas and divided it

15
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:40,454
into eight pieces for eight people.

16
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:43,402
And I also see where, and
when I talk to Katriana,

17
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,538
she said, "Well I got one
eighth, plus one eighth,

18
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:47,628
and one eighth, and one
eighth and one eighth.

19
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:49,788
How much is that gonna add up to equal?

20
00:00:49,788 --> 00:00:51,668
She's got one eighth, plus
one eighth, plus one eighth,

21
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,456
plus one eighth, plus one
eighth, plus one eighth,

22
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:54,756
plus one eighth.

23
00:00:54,756 --> 00:00:55,848
- Seven eighths.

24
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,595
- Seven eighths, okay.

25
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:01,077
And that's how much pizza she told us.

26
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:03,678
What about seven divided by eight?

27
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:06,835
A bunch a groups kept their
hand down after Anielli shared

28
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:08,647
that number sentence.

29
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,177
But it's not a complete
number sentence until

30
00:01:11,177 --> 00:01:13,755
we can finish that equation.

31
00:01:13,755 --> 00:01:16,413
What would seven divided
by eight come out to equal

32
00:01:16,413 --> 00:01:17,818
do you think?

33
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,654
Talk at your group for
just a minute again

34
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:23,674
I think we're just
a little bit unsure.

35
00:01:23,674 --> 00:01:25,764
[Background Chatter]

36
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:26,786
- What are you thinkin' for

37
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,091
seven divided by eight?

38
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:37,885
[Background Chatter]

39
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:40,141
Let's come talk it over
with this group.

40
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,117
You check with this group,

41
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,324
I'll check with this group.

42
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:44,251
What are ya'll thinkin' up here?

43
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,039
[Background Chatter]

44
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,918
Well, what do you see
in her representation?

45
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:52,465
[Background Chatter]

46
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,048
You see how many pizza's?

47
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,108
[Background Chatter]

48
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,610
Okay, seven pizzas.

49
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:04,950
- Eight people.

50
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,490
- And eight people.

51
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,146
[Background Chatter]

52
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:17,391
Did she divide those seven
pizzas into eight groups?

53
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,480
Okay, so we've just gotta
figure out how much then,

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,175
that's gonna come out to equal.

55
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,356
I'm not sure.

56
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:26,354
Talk about it as a group.

57
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,328
You can draw it on the back.

58
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,946
Okay.

59
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,924
Yes, thank you, ma'am.

60
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,340
Okay, thank you so much for
talkin' with your group.

61
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,685
What did you or someone
at your group think again?

62
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:48,282
If we've got seven pizzas
divided by eight people.

63
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:49,261
Katia?

64
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:52,581
- We've got 56 divided by eight

65
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:54,229
because there's 56 pieces,

66
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,762
and it's kinda [inaudible].

67
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:57,131
- Okay, so you noticed there's

68
00:02:57,131 --> 00:03:00,591
56 pizzas, I'm sorry, 56 pieces,

69
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:01,869
and it's cut into...

70
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:02,913
- Eight.

71
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:03,889
- Eight slices.

72
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,095
So you were thinking something
a little bit differently.

73
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,140
Savannah?

74
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,745
- We, I thought the same way except

75
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,782
I thought that it was gonna be 56...

76
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,600
Divided by seven.

77
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,429
because...

78
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,543
Each one of them is shaded in,

79
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:26,313
and they're all going to [inaudible]

80
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:27,595
eight people.

81
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,777
- Okay.  Let me ask us all this.

82
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,357
I love that we're relating this back

83
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,167
thinking about some of our math facts,

84
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:35,164
and how that can tie in and help us.

85
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,672
But what did Katriana start with here?

86
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:40,342
What do you think the
first thing she did was?

87
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:43,122
[Inaudible]

88
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:48,143
What did she do, Steven?

89
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:50,280
- Drew seven or eight pizzas.

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,555
- Did she draw seven pizzas
or eight pizzas?

91
00:03:56,305 --> 00:03:57,150
- Seven.

92
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,261
- Seven pizzas.

93
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,771
Is that what she did first?

94
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:01,954
Okay.  She drew out her seven pizzas.

95
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:04,160
So we wanna know, or we need to know that

96
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,110
that's what she started with.

97
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,291
What did she divide those pizzas into?

98
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,637
- Into eighths.

99
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:11,636
- Into eight.

100
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,569
We see she cut 'em into eight pizzas.

101
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,265
Brennan.

102
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,608
- I did [inaudible]

103
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:23,053
I was thinking either 700,

104
00:04:23,053 --> 00:04:24,703
or seven tenths.

105
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:27,644
- Okay.  So we're thinking
back to fractions.

106
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:30,408
I think since we don't
have a definite answer,

107
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:31,661
we don't need to yet.

108
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,588
Let's leave this kinda open-ended,

109
00:04:33,588 --> 00:04:34,987
but I'm gonna circle it so that we

110
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:36,613
remember to come back to it.

111
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,795
So we've gotta a great number
sentence that one thing

112
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,094
Katriana did was add up one
eighth, plus one eighth,

113
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,346
plus one eighth, plus one
eighth, plus one eighth,

114
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:44,880
plus one eighth, plus one eighth,

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,667
and she got seven eighths
and we're gonna

116
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,151
keep thinking about...

117
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,053
I saw a bit of agreement
that seven pizzas,

118
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,283
she divided by eight people.

119
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:56,489
But we need to figure out, ladies,

120
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:59,600
how much that would mean
each person gets.

121
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,435
So put a big arrow.

122
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,174
So as we continue let's
keep that in our mind.

123
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:05,730
Okay, thank you.

124
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,490
Can I have...

125
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:10,443
The person who put this one up in black.

126
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,720
Faith, was that you?

127
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,415
Will you come tell us what you did,

128
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,853
and what you think the
answer might be here.

129
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:18,703
How much pizza each person got.

130
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,890
- Well, I knew there
was eight soccer players,

131
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,004
so there were seven pizzas,

132
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,883
so I did seven pizzas.

133
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:29,854
Then I divided six of
'em up in to fourths,

134
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,921
and then I numbered 'em all.

135
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:35,078
And then when I got to eight
I started one, two, three,

136
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:37,726
back over again when I
got to another eight,

137
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:40,488
I did it again but then I
realized that there wasn't

138
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:44,460
enough, or more, so
I split the last pizza

139
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,547
up into eighths and that
equals up to eight people.

140
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,427
- Okay, and that equaled up
to eight people.

141
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,845
So how much pizza do you
think each person gets?

142
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:58,560
- Well, I think that each person

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,367
would get at least one fourth,

144
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,597
and [inaudible].

145
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:07,847
- Okay, so let's write this up here.

146
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:10,005
So you said each person gets,

147
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,690
let's put it up in black.

148
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,239
How much? Like let's say person number 1.

149
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:15,330
How much pizza do they get?

150
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,283
Will you show us?

151
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:20,246
- They would get one, two, three...

152
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,368
They would get three fourths.

153
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:26,158
- Okay.

154
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:27,435
- And then one eighth.

155
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,455
- Three fourths and one eighth.

156
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,010
Like this?

157
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,375
Okay, do you know how
much that is all together?

158
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,768
- That would...

159
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:40,553
That would equal up to four [inaudible].

160
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:41,528
- Okay.

161
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,966
So let's think about
this one for a minute.

162
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,636
Do you have any questions for Faith

163
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:49,140
about how she figured this out?

164
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:53,115
Okay, I think she did a great
job explaining her picture.

165
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:55,529
So she showed us where each person gets

166
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,597
three fourths plus one eighth.

167
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,663
Will you talk at your group?

168
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,699
How much is that?

169
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:05,771
How much is that total?

170
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,352
Thank you, if you wanna join a group.

171
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:11,056
Good explanation.

172
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,649
[Background Chatter]

173
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,760
Okay, group what do we think?
- Four twelfths.

174
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:20,342
- You agree with her four twelfths?

175
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:22,618
How did you come up with four twelfths?

176
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:27,011
- By adding those two together.

177
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,847
- How did you add them together?

178
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,307
- Three plus one would equal four,

179
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:34,558
and then four would be the numerator

180
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:37,043
because you added the two top numbers.

181
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:40,224
And if you added the two bottom numbers,

182
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:43,243
it would equal twelve for the denominator.

183
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:45,216
- Okay, so is there a picture,

184
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,444
or is there a way that we
could show this with pictures

185
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:49,628
that that would come out
to equal four twelfths?

186
00:07:49,628 --> 00:07:51,619
[Background Chatter]

187
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,247
- See, on the back of your paper once

188
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:57,446
will you draw a representation
of four twelfths?

189
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,396
[Background Chatter]

190
00:08:01,307 --> 00:08:02,230
How come?

191
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:03,461
- Because.

192
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:09,277
I thought that if the
denominators were different,

193
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,623
we couldn't add them up directly.

194
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:12,226
- Oh.

195
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:16,011
- So, we tried to get
the denominators the same.

196
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:17,614
- What do we call that?

197
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,320
- Equal to fractions [inaudible].

198
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:29,850
- I like that your thinking
back to remember

199
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,150
your vocabulary.

200
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,146
- I tried to tell Katia
that if it has a

201
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,863
different number on the
bottom then we're supposed to

202
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:38,115
add the [inaudible] on the bottom to--

203
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,926
- I don't know.

204
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:41,692
Have we learned to do that before?

205
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,943
- Well no, but I just thought about it,

206
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,474
and I've been practicing.

207
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:47,311
- Okay.

208
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:49,910
So if we haven't learned it
yet we've gotta think about

209
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,303
how are we gonna figure it out, right?

210
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:53,882
Okay, so keep thinking.

211
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:55,947
It's okay that we're debating
between a couple different

212
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:58,410
answers just tryin' to
explain to each other

213
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,877
why you're thinking four twelfths,

214
00:08:59,877 --> 00:09:03,027
and why you're thinking
something different.

215
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:05,617
- I thought it was [inaudible]

216
00:09:05,617 --> 00:09:07,415
because...

217
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:10,285
Whenever you add it up [inaudible]

218
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:13,686
And the denominator [inaudible].

219
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:18,060
- Okay.  So I understand where you got the

220
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,964
four slices.

221
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:22,425
But what size are those slices?

222
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:24,051
Would be my next question.

223
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:26,860
Because we wanna make
sure every soccer player

224
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,530
gets the same amount
'cause I would be upset if

225
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,434
I didn't get as much pizza as you did.

226
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,245
I like pizza.

227
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,608
[Background Chatter]

228
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,395
Okay.

229
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:41,042
[Background Chatter]

230
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:47,270
- Okay, well it says four twelfths,

231
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,104
so we're shading four--

232
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:50,799
- Do you have 12 pieces there?

233
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,527
- We have one, two, three--

234
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,839
- Okay.

235
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,581
If I can have your attention back.

236
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,435
I know some of you are still discussing,

237
00:09:58,435 --> 00:09:59,967
and doing a great job.

238
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:03,055
But I wanna make sure that
we've got time to get through

239
00:10:03,055 --> 00:10:05,354
the rest of our solutions
before we're out of

240
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,562
time for the day.

241
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,116
Hailey, if I can have you
close the door again for us.

242
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,623
And can I hear what a couple
of your groups came up with?

243
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:13,736
I heard three or four different things

244
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:15,409
as I was going around.

245
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,776
Three fourths, Hannah said
each person gets three fourths

246
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:21,794
of a pizza and one eighth.

247
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:23,186
- Faith said.
- How much is that?

248
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:25,671
Yes, I'm sorry, Faith
said since ya'll sat next

249
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,668
to each other I still mess that up.

250
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,106
Three fourths and one eighth.

251
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,986
How much did you or your group think

252
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:33,868
that came out to be, Nathan?

253
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,305
- We came up with seven eighths.

254
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:38,511
- Seven eighths.

255
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,854
- Because when you take three fourths,

256
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:44,525
and then you take another
circle that shows one eighth,

257
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,609
then you divide the three
fourths into eighths,

258
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,913
then add the [inaudible]

259
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,879
the ones that used to be three fourths

260
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,156
and that equals seven eighths.

261
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,968
- Can you come up and show that to us?

262
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:59,638
I think, I think I followed in my head,

263
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:01,698
but did you all have
trouble making that picture

264
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:02,660
in your head?

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,350
- Yes.

266
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,743
- A little bit, yeah.

267
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:05,556
Can you show us?

268
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:09,149
You can draw it here, or over
here we've got lots of room.

269
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:11,012
- Nathan, you're right.

270
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:12,004
[Background Chatter]

271
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,282
- Shhh.

272
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:15,906
Okay, let's see what he does.

273
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,489
Okay, can you step to the...

274
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:34,020
step to the side so everybody
in the class can see you.

275
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,547
There you go.

276
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:38,211
- And then if you divide
that into eighths,

277
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:44,039
then you add one of the eighths
then you add this over here.

278
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,759
It comes out to be seven eighths.

279
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,193
- Can I just get in..

280
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:53,660
agreement or disagreement
somebody who had shared with us.

281
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,726
What do you think about what he just did?

282
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:58,280
I saw him draw three eighths at one pizza,

283
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,322
and one, or three fourths of one pizza,

284
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,947
and one eighth of the next.

285
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:06,430
And then I saw him cut
this one into eighths.

286
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,821
How many eighths was three fourths?

287
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:09,727
When you cut it?

288
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:10,354
Six eighths.

289
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,955
And then he put one more
eighth over and seven eighths.

290
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:15,509
What are you thinkin' about that, Brazy?

291
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,088
- I agree with him.

292
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:17,784
- Why?

293
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:20,919
- Because our group
said that we know that

294
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:24,304
four eighths is equal to...

295
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,652
twelve fourths is
equivalent to seven eighths,

296
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,401
and his picture we can
see that it's two

297
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,803
and when he was workin'
it out we could see that

298
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:39,217
it was right and so I agree with him.

299
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,703
- Okay, Brennan?

300
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,050
- I agree with him, but I have

301
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,513
a different explanation.

302
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,418
- Okay.

303
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:47,390
- One fourth is equal to two eighths,

304
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,225
but then you take--

305
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,782
- Oh, I'm sorry.

306
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,011
Let me write this as you're
saying it so we can follow it.

307
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,700
So you said...

308
00:12:54,124 --> 00:12:58,071
- One fourth is equal to two eighths.

309
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:58,790
- Okay.

310
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,109
- So...

311
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:04,329
We multiplied the three and the numerator

312
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,364
with three fourths.

313
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:08,432
- Okay.

314
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,381
- By two, which comes
from the two eighths and it

315
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:14,916
would equal up to six eighths
plus that one extra eighth

316
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,309
it would be seven eighths.

317
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,397
- Okay, so you said
three fourths is equivalent to

318
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:20,558
- Six eighths.

319
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:21,981
- Six eighths, okay.

320
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:23,931
- And then just add
the other one, seven eighths.

321
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:26,369
- Okay, so
then you did six eighths,

322
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,342
plus one eighth,

323
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,642
equals seven eighths, like that?

324
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,893
Okay, can I just see a
quick, on your remotes,

325
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,639
do you agree or disagree

326
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,059
with Nathan and Brennan?

327
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,806
So, A is I agree.

328
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:44,389
B I disagree, or I'm confused.

329
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:46,065
- What's confused?

330
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:47,458
- We'll just do A and B.

331
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,479
A is I agree, I understand,

332
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:52,382
or B is I disagree, or I'm confused.

333
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:55,817
How are you feeling right
now about what Brennan

334
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,210
and Nathan just said?

335
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,602
They're two different explanations.

336
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,687
I just wanna see right now,

337
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:08,495
do you agree or disagree
with what Brennan and Nathan

338
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,749
just said.

339
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,768
And again they were
saying that three fourths,

340
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,090
plus one eighth is gonna come
out to equal seven eighths.

341
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,039
And they each kinda
explained it a different way.

342
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,522
One with words and one with a picture.

343
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:25,828
Need a couple more people to
vote if they agree or disagree.

344
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:36,717
Number three, number eleven we
need a vote from you please.

345
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:45,467
[Background Chatter]

346
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:47,769
Where is remote number three?

347
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:50,214
There it comes.

348
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:51,101
Okay.

349
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:54,678
What do we, what do we know
by looking at this graph?

350
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:56,918
What do we know by looking
at this graph?

351
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,005
Thomas?
