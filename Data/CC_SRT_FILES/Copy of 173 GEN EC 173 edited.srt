1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,417
- [Teacher] Okay let's get busy.

2
00:00:01,417 --> 00:00:02,857
(Background Chatter)

3
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,573
- [Teacher] So before we change the
car we have two more times.

4
00:00:10,117 --> 00:00:20,437
(Background Chatter)

5
00:00:21,277 --> 00:00:22,647
- [Teacher] Okay let's look Jacob, let's help.

6
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:29,658
- [Student] It's 9-3.

7
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:31,078
- [Teacher] What is 9, three?

8
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:32,487
- [Student] 93.

9
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,437
- [Teacher] 93.

10
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:36,047
Is there a way, that we can
maybe change to other things

11
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,517
here, to make it go further?

12
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,477
Like the car?

13
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,518
- [Students] Yeah.

14
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:40,167
- [Teacher] How?

15
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:43,117
Maybe the height?

16
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,237
How about you guys discuss.

17
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:50,030
(Background Chatter)

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,267
- [Teacher] Oh, try it.

19
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:52,850
Put that way back like that.

20
00:00:53,277 --> 00:00:55,437
It might need help, for
you holding the ramp,

21
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:57,098
how bout you, do you
think that's a good idea?

22
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,117
- [Student] I'm gonna roll it back.

23
00:00:59,071 --> 00:00:59,877
- [Teacher] Alright.

24
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:01,968
- [Student] Oh.

25
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:02,350
(clicks)

26
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,318
- [Teacher] Is it gonna stay you think?

27
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:06,697
- [Student] Yeah, I bet.

28
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,447
- [Teacher] Awesome.

29
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,437
Let's see how far it went.

30
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:21,040
(Background Chatter)

31
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:22,397
- [Teacher] Watch your foot.

32
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,107
- [Student] 105.

33
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,837
- [Teacher] What is 105?

34
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:31,077
- [Student] 105.

35
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:32,507
- [Teacher] I love the way
that you're making sure

36
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:34,918
that that goes nice and
smooth on the way in.

37
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:38,597
So let's take a look Jacob,
let's look over here.

38
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:43,060
Let's look at our data,
we have the roll one,

39
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,250
with just the normal
way, we had 101 inches.

40
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,037
And then the roll two which was again

41
00:01:49,037 --> 00:01:51,618
the same way at 93 inches.

42
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:54,150
And roll three at 105 inches.

43
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,197
Which way went the furthest?

44
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:59,037
- [Student] 103, roll three.
- [Teacher] Roll three.

45
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:00,427
Why do you think that is?

46
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:05,091
- [Student] Because it's 101, that one is 101,

47
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,697
and that ones 105.

48
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:09,557
- [Teacher] Well why do you think roll one

49
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:10,938
is different from roll three?

50
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,997
- [Student] Because ones higher then the other.

51
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:16,518
- [Other Student] (mumbles)...higher then the other.

52
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,157
- [Teacher] Because ones higher then the other.

53
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,637
Okay, so do you want to try to add in

54
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:22,817
or take away something from this vehicle?

55
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,117
- [Student] I think we should--

56
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:25,277
- [Teacher] What do you think we should pick?

57
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:26,877
(Background Chatter)

58
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,028
- [Student] Take away the girl.

59
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,757
- [Teacher] Take away the girl?

60
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,187
- [Student] Nothing. (Background Chatter)

61
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,707
- [Teacher] What do you guys think
about Hailey's idea?

62
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:35,477
What did she say?

63
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,042
- [Student] Jacob S.

64
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,607
- [Teacher] Hold on, what did Hailey say?

65
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:43,037
Say it again.

66
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,937
(Background Chatter)

67
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,207
- [Teacher] We shouldn't even try?

68
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,067
- [Student] Okay, (mumbles)

69
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:50,838
- [Teacher] Okay so how about Jacob, since Jacob

70
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,557
was trying to make the other car, how 'bout

71
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:54,437
Jacob tries to put on bigger wheels?

72
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,157
We should see what happens then.

73
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:58,197
(clicks)

74
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:00,237
- [Teacher] Here Jacob.

75
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:03,798
Well look at this, look at which one

76
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:04,837
would we need bigger wheels on?

77
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:06,597
- [Student] That one
- [Student] That one.

78
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:07,627
- [Teacher] Okay.

79
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,657
- [Student] So (Background Chatter) that car.

80
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:21,997
Go farther, that one will go farther.

81
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:24,822
- [Teacher] Probably will go farther
you think, with bigger wheels?

82
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:25,550
- (Background Chatter)

83
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,397
- [Student] Yeah.

84
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:29,167
- [Student] 'Cause the bigger the wheel,
the easier it has balance.

85
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:31,957
-  [Teacher] Did you hear what he said?

86
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:33,638
- [Student] Bigger wheels have balance.

87
00:03:33,638 --> 00:03:37,337
- [Teacher] The bigger the wheels
the more balanced it is.

88
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:40,237
- [Student] I'm saying like, let's say
you're (Background Chatter)

89
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,517
- [Teacher] Is that gonna work?

90
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,820
Is there anything else you
guys want to do to this car?

91
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,117
Or do you just want to change one thing?

92
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:46,877
- [Student] I just change one thing.

93
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,318
- [Teacher] Okay, it's your car.

94
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,431
So what about your ramp?

95
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,877
Ashley, what about your ramp,

96
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,157
how do you want your ramp to be?

97
00:03:56,317 --> 00:04:00,197
- [Student] Maybe we can take this off
and do it in the normal way.

98
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:02,447
- [Teacher] Okay.

99
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:03,368
- [Student] (clickety-clack) 76.

100
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,870
- [Teacher] You want to try that way? Alright.

101
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,037
(Background Chatter)

102
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:08,190
- [Teacher] That's true.

103
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,069
- [Student] Whoa.

104
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,277
- [Student] That wasn't go far.

105
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,718
- [Teacher] Alright, let's measure.

106
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:13,917
- [Student] It goes a little bit.

107
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:14,910
She needs a little bit of help.

108
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:17,277
(Background Chatter)

109
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:26,638
- [Student] 72.

110
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:28,717
- [Teacher] 72.

111
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,027
- [Student] We're gonna put this vehicle--

112
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:35,317
- [Teacher] Alright, so we're not
going to change the car,

113
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,878
but what could we do?

114
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:37,807
- [Student] 32.

115
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:38,597
- [Student] Whoa look.

116
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:40,767
- {Student] Guys this is going
to be affecting weight okay?

117
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:45,077
- [Student] That box could stay here
instead of-- (Background Chatter)

118
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,717
- [Teacher] Alright, you guys try
it. You guys got it now?

119
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:51,237
- [Student] 91 times 2.
(Background Chatter)

120
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:54,477
- [Teacher] Well that's up to your group.

121
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:55,837
- [Student] Can I make my car now?

122
00:04:56,277 --> 00:04:58,597
- [Teacher] No, not yet. That's not weight three yet.

123
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:04,267
- [Student] Split weight right now
so--(Background Chatter)

124
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:05,537
- [Teacher] How you guys doing?

125
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,448
(clickety-clack)

126
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,868
- [Teacher] Did you guys try to move the
weight in different ways?

127
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:13,237
- [Student] Ok.
- [Student] Alright, back.

128
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:19,357
- [Student] Let's do it together 
(Background Chatter)

129
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:25,437
- [Student] 56.

130
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,657
- [Teacher] (gasp) Look at
that, let's see what happened.

131
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:28,167
- [Student] No it's 67.

132
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,428
- [Teacher] Where's your data at?

133
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:33,379
Put the data over here so
we're all in the same place.

134
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:35,278
- [Student] 83.

135
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:36,717
- [Teacher] Okay let's take a look.

136
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:38,198
What do you have here?

137
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:39,557
- [Student] 67.

138
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:58,728
(Background Chatter)

139
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:00,757
- [Student] This will be so much fun.

140
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:03,677
- [Student] Okay, you roll it.

141
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:06,037
- [Student] Ashley, can I work on it, can I have it?

142
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:07,469
- [Student] Should we take something away first?

143
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,147
- [Student] No.

144
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:10,517
- [Student] No.

145
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,117
- [Student] 42!

146
00:06:15,357 --> 00:06:17,230
- [Student] I think we should put a little one.

147
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,998
Gimme that.

148
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:19,008
- [Student] You think we should-- 
(Background Chatter)

149
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:23,837
- [Student] I'm not sure.

150
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:25,078
- Cause the blue one (background chatter)

151
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:25,997
- [Student] Wow.

152
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,121
- [Student] Cool!

153
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:30,957
- [Student] Oh.

154
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:33,237
Oh my gosh.

155
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,477
- [Student] Here I'll--(Background Chatter)

156
00:06:35,737 --> 00:06:36,997
- [Student] (Background Chatter)

157
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:39,197
- [Student] Yeah.

158
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:42,317
- [Student] And without these wheels.

159
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:47,037
Now?

160
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:50,837
Are you ready?

161
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:55,077
- [Student] Go!

162
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,117
- [Student] Here, here we go.

163
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:03,327
Ouchie.

164
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:04,577
(Background Chatter) hold the end.

165
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,237
- [Student] I'll hold it.

166
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,117
77.

167
00:07:20,117 --> 00:07:21,117
- [Student] 77?

168
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:22,910
- [Student] No, it's 67.

169
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:25,367
- [Student] Jacob (Background Chatter)

170
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,077
- [Student] 67.

171
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,837
- [Student] Might be 77.

172
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:35,831
- [Student] What is 77?

173
00:07:37,197 --> 00:07:39,030
- (Background Chatter)

174
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:45,157
[Student] We did it for two ways so
they can do it last way.

175
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:48,317
- [Student] That was way more.

176
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:49,917
- [Student] Yeah but (Background Chatter)

177
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,498
- [Teacher] How many inches was that second roll?

178
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:05,847
- [Student] Look--
- [Student] Three feet so 3 F.

179
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:10,997
- [Teacher] So what, three feet equals
12 times three, 36 inches.

180
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:12,277
- [Student] 36 inches.

181
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:14,541
- [Teacher] We're going to be focused on the inches

182
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,590
so we don't get confused.

183
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,588
- [Student] (Laughs)

184
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,318
- [Teacher] So hold on, wait a second.
When we had that ramp

185
00:08:19,318 --> 00:08:20,797
the first way, what did you do with it,

186
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:21,798
the same way as the first way?

187
00:08:21,798 --> 00:08:23,518
- [Student] No we did...

188
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:28,017
this way.

189
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,438
- [Teacher] Just that?

190
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:30,158
- [Student] Yeah.

191
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:31,437
- [Student] We haven't done it like that.

192
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,738
- [Teacher] I know just re-adjust this.

193
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:33,597
- [Student] Yeah.

194
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,917
- [Teacher] So when did it go,
when you did just that?

195
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,037
(Background Chatter)

196
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,409
- [Student] 30 seconds, no it went that.

197
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,437
- [Teacher] What is that?

198
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,557
- [Student] 73.

199
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:43,557
- [Teacher] 73.

200
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:46,077
So then we moved it, to make it, which way

201
00:08:46,077 --> 00:08:46,798
did we do it the second way?
- [Student] Higher.

202
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:50,277
- [Teacher] We did it this way, what
happened to the numbers?

203
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:51,437
- [Student] It went lower.

204
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:52,758
- [Teacher] It went lower?

205
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,517
- [Student] So if we go it lower, it goes higher.

206
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:56,957
- [Teacher] I don't know, let's try.

207
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:00,367
So what's another ramp that we can make?

208
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:01,631
Have you tried that way before?

209
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:02,270
- [Student] Nope.

210
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,598
- [Teacher] Alright, let's see.

211
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,957
Hold on a second David,
we have to measure.

212
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,191
- [David] (Background Chatter)

213
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,887
- [Teacher] Nope, your group can help you measure.

214
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:18,757
Let's see.

215
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,207
- [David] 35.

216
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:33,717
Ooh, that's seven.

217
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:36,710
- [Teacher] Okay, let's take a
look again, let's make sure.

218
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,077
What's that?

219
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:42,627
- [David] (Background Chatter)
- [Teacher] There we go.

220
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,350
So roll three, let's try.

221
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,237
Now let's take a look
at our data, hold on.

222
00:09:49,877 --> 00:09:52,077
- [David] That's not gonna work.

223
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:53,237
- [Teacher] You don't think so?

224
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:55,557
Well let's first take a look here and then

225
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:56,957
we can see if that will work.

226
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,067
- [David] It's probably gonna fall.

227
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,677
- [Teacher] What happened with roll
three, where's the data?

228
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,407
Look at roll three, what is it?

229
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:05,607
- [Student] 35.

230
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,287
- [Teacher] And what's roll two?

231
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:09,798
- [Student] I don't know.

232
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:11,077
- [Teacher] 36.

233
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,317
So what do you think happened,

234
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:14,651
whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher?

235
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,047
I mean a little bit lower I'm sorry.

236
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:17,638
- [Student] It changed?

237
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:18,548
- [Teacher] It changed.

238
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,397
What happened when it changed?

239
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:20,711
- [Student] The number.

240
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:21,837
- [Teacher] I see, let's focus.

241
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,677
- [Student] It goes more...faster.

242
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,157
- [Teacher] It might go more faster.

243
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:28,877
There's not another roll four but you made

244
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,197
a very interesting ramp,
and you guys wanna try that?

245
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,598
- [Student] Yeah.

246
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,317
- [Teacher] Okay let's see, let's
see what happens Taylor.

247
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,587
(gasp) What happened?
- [Students] (gasp)

248
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:39,790
- [Student] It fell.

249
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,397
- [David] I knew it would.

250
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:41,711
- [Student] (Background Chatter)--my box.

251
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:44,030
- [Teacher] Well how about you hold
that, so we can try it again.

252
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,511
Try it again.

253
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,797
Oh no!

254
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:52,357
Fix em and let's see if
it does that every time,

255
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,957
do you think it'll do it every time?

256
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:54,697
- [David] Yes.
- [Students] Yes.

257
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,837
-  [Teacher] Let's try again.

258
00:10:55,837 --> 00:10:56,558
- [Student] I'll measure this time.

259
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,117
- [Teacher] You'll measure?

260
00:10:58,117 --> 00:10:58,987
- [Student] Yeah.

261
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,437
- [Teacher] Oh.
- [Student] Oh.

262
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:02,557
- [Student] We have to do it again.

263
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:04,231
- [David] Taylor, you can go on the carpet.

264
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:06,350
- [Student] This time I made it lower.

265
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:07,717
(Collective gasp)

266
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:08,367
- [Student] Oh

267
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,317
- [Teacher] So he just said
something, what did he say?

268
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,397
- [Student] He made it lower.
- [David] He made it lower.

269
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:13,597
- [Teacher] So what's happening, every time

270
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,227
he makes it a little bit lower?

271
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:17,077
- [Student] It falls off.

272
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,158
- [David] When it falls off, it still can roll.

273
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:25,397
I mean just keep it
rolling when it falls off.

274
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,157
- [Teacher] Uh oh (laughs).

275
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:34,767
- [Student] I'll measure it.

276
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:35,727
- [Student] Okay.

277
00:11:36,077 --> 00:11:38,598
- [Teacher] We don't have enough
space to measure that one,

278
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,478
how about we change the car and try again.

279
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,967
But what did you guys notice
every time the ramp changed?

280
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,797
What happened when it was super high?

281
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:47,591
- [Taylor] It fell apart.

282
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,910
- [Teacher] It didn't work so well, can you imagine

283
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,797
if you were in a real
car, and you were going

284
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:53,197
down something that steep?

285
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,437
- [Student] Yeah.

286
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:54,937
- [Student] No.

287
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:57,157
- [Teacher] That would be kinda scary wouldn't it?

288
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:01,197
But, as it kept going down, what happened?

289
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,758
- [Student] It didn't go off.

290
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:08,157
- [Teacher] It didn't fall apart,
you're right. Alright go back

291
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,477
and try to make a different car.

292
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,790
Okay go back and try
to make it, be careful

293
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,407
your gonna make me nervous.

294
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:21,050
(Background Chatter)

295
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,157
- [Teacher] Alright let's
see Jacob, what do you have?

296
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:27,907
Come on over.

297
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,698
Nope, Jacob come on over.

298
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:40,637
What in the world did you make?

299
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:42,238
That looks like a Mack Truck.

300
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:45,948
Girls do you see this?

301
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,007
- [Students] Yeah.

302
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,057
- [Student] Tractors, throwing in something.

303
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:53,157
- [Teacher] Now take a look roll
it and see if that one

304
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:54,077
feels good to you.

305
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,477
- [Student] Big.

306
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,940
- [Teacher] Girls are you watching?
Look at how that rolled.

307
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:01,877
Girls, you next.

308
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,838
- (Background Chatter)

309
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:05,751
- [Teacher] Okay.

310
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,157
- [Student] This was all my idea.

311
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,870
- [Teacher] That was your idea? I love it.

312
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,138
- [Student] Could we try it this way?

313
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,917
- [Teacher] We could, keep a hold of
that you might want to try it.

314
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:18,437
Let's see....

315
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:20,957
Well we should be working on--

316
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:22,677
Correctamundo.

317
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:25,037
- [Student] See? I got a good review.

318
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:26,758
- [Teacher] What do we got Jacob?

319
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:29,407
- [Student] 93.

320
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,678
- [Teacher] 93.

321
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,668
So what can we do to change it?

322
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,077
- [Student] I guess we could maybe...

323
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:37,147
- [Student] We're learning something.

324
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:38,647
- [Teacher] We are learning something,
what did we learning?

325
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,070
- [Student] We learned the car, the littler it is,

326
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,470
the harder for it to fall.

327
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:43,840
- [Teacher] That is true?

328
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,691
- [Student] It's your turn.

329
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,597
- [Teacher] Is that what you're finding
out, the smaller the car?

330
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:47,357
- [Student] Yeah.

331
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,677
- [Student] The smaller the car,
the more it picks up.

332
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,037
- [Teacher] Picks up?

333
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:54,568
- [Student] Cars go over.

334
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:56,997
- [Teacher] Oh were we going over?

335
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,547
- [Student] No I--(Background Chatter)

336
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,678
- [Student] It's your turn Preston.

337
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,997
- [Teacher] Oh, did you guys hear him?
Let's take a second and listen.

338
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:05,997
He was talking about
yesterday's experiment,

339
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:07,157
what did we do yesterday?

340
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:09,637
- [Student] We tried rolling little
cars on the carpet.

341
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,438
- [Teacher] Why didn't it work out so well Jacob?

342
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:14,077
Little cars on the carpet.

343
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:17,437
- [Student] Because the wheels stopped them.

344
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,957
- [Teacher] Why did they stop, you think?

345
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,477
- [Student] Because the carpets too rough.

346
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,527
- [Teacher] Because the carpet's too rough.

347
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:25,837
Did you guys find that too?

348
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:28,080
So what are you finding about today?

349
00:14:29,318 --> 00:14:33,607
- [Student] That the bigger the
wheels, the (Background Chatter)

350
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,397
--on hard surfaces.

351
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:38,478
- [Teacher] It's faster on smoother and
hard surfaces, it goes further

352
00:14:38,738 --> 00:14:40,631
So what are you finding
out about the ramp?

353
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:44,997
- [Student] That--(Background Chatter)

354
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:47,927
- [Teacher] You guys are finding
that? How about you decide

355
00:14:47,927 --> 00:14:50,871
that for this last one, you
tried one way with the ramp.

356
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:54,767
And now we're going to try,
two more ways with this ramp,

357
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,797
and I want to see if guys can figure out,

358
00:14:56,797 --> 00:14:59,027
how this works better with a ramp.
