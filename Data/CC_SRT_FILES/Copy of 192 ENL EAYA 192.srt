1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,120
- Okay. What objects or pictures do you
see?

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,828
- I see a flag.
- A flag.

3
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:07,000
- [together] A sign.
- The sun.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,560
- And the letters.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,120
- A sign. Yeah.
- And the birds.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,280
- There are birds over here.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,574
- People carrying bags.

8
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:18,310
- Okay, people carrying bags.

9
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:22,912
- There's a ship.
- A ship.

10
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:24,584
- The ladies all have hats.

11
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:27,950
- Okay. The ladies all have hats on. They
look like they're dressed to go somewhere,

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,382
right?
- [together] Yeah.

13
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:31,730
- Good. All right.

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,020
- Do you want us to write it in here?

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,260
- You can copy it. I have the words
spelled up here. We have Uncle Sam. We

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,070
have a boat.
- Do you want us to write it?

17
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,810
- I'm going to have it up here. Yeah.

18
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,910
- Oh.
- We have a flag.

19
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,750
- We have this thing. What does this thing
look like?

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,800
- Kind of like a witch.
- No. No.

21
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,890
- Yeah. It looks kind of like a witch.
Something scary anyway, right?

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,860
- [together] Yeah.
- Broccoli.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,510
- It looks like broccoli? Okay. Yeah, it
does. It's kind of fluffy on top. I agree.

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,300
- All right.
- There are people.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,920
- We've got people. We've got birds.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,340
- [inaudible]

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,290
- Mm-hmm. So here are our objects. Uncle
Sam, boat, American flag. I wrote scary

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,410
devil-looking thing. If you want to put
witch-looking thing, that's fine.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,370
- I'm gonna put both.
- Traveling people and birds.

30
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:29,701
- [inaudible]

31
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:35,850
- I put enough blanks for a few objects,
but feel free to add more than the number

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,028
of lines I wrote.

33
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:20,910
All right. Okay. Which of the objects--
whoops. Okay. Which of the objects do you

34
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,970
see could be symbols?

35
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,510
- [together] The flag.

36
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,640
- All right. This is what I want you to
do. Stop. Turn to the person beside you.

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,870
Beside you, beside you, beside you. See if
you can think of-- you already said flag.

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,950
That's a perfect example. It is one of
them. I think four of these are symbols.

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,000
Not every object is going to be a symbol.
So turn and see if you and your partner

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,030
can come up with any more.

41
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,200
[Background Chatter]

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,850
- [inaudible]

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,960
- Each pair can be that.

44
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,550
- [inaudible]

45
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,570
- Two different. Yeah.

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,800
- Oh.

47
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:23,811
[Background Chatter]

48
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,299
- All right. What did we come up with?

49
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:51,340
- We came up with the top of his hat
thing. It's the same as the flag.

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,430
- It looks exactly like the flag, okay? So
what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of?

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,560
- [together] U.S.

52
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,910
- Of the United States. Good.

53
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,410
- Did you come up with one?

54
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,130
- The traveling people.

55
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,670
- The traveling people? What do you think
they symbolize?

56
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,720
- They're from other countries.

57
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,300
- Yeah. They symbolize people from other
countries. Good. Did you come up with one?

58
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,940
- The scary devil-looking thing.

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,940
- Okay. What is that?

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,630
- It's clouds in the sky?

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,330
- Okay. It looks like clouds, but why did
the artist draw the clouds as a

62
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:33,310
scary-looking thing?

63
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,997
- To get them out?
- To scare them?

64
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:41,070
- Or maybe it's the rain. They're scared
of storms.

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,500
- Okay. Who is the devil-looking thing?
Who is he going after?

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,970
- [together] The people.

67
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,190
- The people. What are the people running
away from?

68
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,166
- From their other countries.

69
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:02,770
- From their other countries. So what
could the cloud be a symbol of?

70
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,940
- Bad things.
- Immigrants?

71
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,246
- Yeah. They're the immigrants. What is
the cloud?

72
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,710
- [inaudible]

73
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,400
- Yeah. Their governments from their own
countries.

74
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,577
- Oh.

75
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:25,560
- Is coming back after them or trying to
scare them, anyway. All right? Here we go.

76
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,740
We have these four. Uncle Sam, the boat,
the American flag, and the devil-looking

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,980
thing. I didn't do one for the travelers,
but you're right. They can symbolize

78
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:43,200
immigrants. Uncle Sam symbolizes America.
This is one you didn't say.

79
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,200
- I told you.
- The ark, this boat here symbolizes what?

80
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,300
- [together] The Bible.

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,120
- The ark from the bible. Okay. Is anybody
familiar with the story of the ark in the

82
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,910
bible?
- [together] Yeah.

83
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,610
- What did the ark do?

84
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,660
- It saved.

85
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,580
- It saved Noah, his family, and who else?
- Animals.

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
- And the animals.
- Oh yeah. Now I remember.

87
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,360
- So what do you think this boat's purpose
in this picture is? What's the boat going

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,290
to do?
- Save them.

89
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,260
- Save. Okay. So knowing that, knowing
that this is an ark and knowing that this

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,896
is America, what do you think? Are these
people being stopped or welcomed?

91
00:06:27,896 --> 00:06:29,034
- [together] Welcomed.

92
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:31,008
- Welcomed. And how do we know that?

93
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,028
- He's letting them in. He's like, come
on, let's go.

94
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,673
- But how do we know that he's welcoming
them and not telling them to stop?

95
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:37,740
- Because it's the ark.

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,030
- Because it says ark, okay? And we're
connecting what we know about the ark to

97
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:52,620
this picture. That is called an allusion.
In English class, you talked about

98
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,840
allusion. Allusion is when you refer to
something that is famous. Some famous

99
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:09,420
piece of literature. Okay? The flag stands
for freedom. The scary devil-looking thing

100
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:22,093
is governments from other countries. Take
a second and copy that down.

101
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:50,020
Okay. I'll go on to the next question. How
are the words-- How do the words in the

102
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,980
cartoon tell you what the symbols mean?
Okay? We talked about this already. The U.

103
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,870
S. Ark of Refuge are some of the words in
the cartoon and they tell us that the boat

104
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:11,480
is a symbol of the United States. Okay?
Identify the cartoon's caption. All right.

105
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,940
In this cartoon, there is no caption.
There is no title at the top or at the

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:26,170
bottom, but there are some words that help
us understand and that's this sign. The

107
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,870
sign says no oppressive taxes, no
expensive kings, no compulsory military

108
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,800
service. So this is the promise of the
United States to the immigrants. To the

109
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:45,920
traveling people. Words or phrases used in
the cartoon to identify objects or people

110
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:54,274
in the cartoon. Okay? What words or
phrases here can be used to identify?

111
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,080
- I was going to say the ark.

112
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,041
- Yeah. The Ark of Refuge. And what does
it identify?

113
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,080
- [inaudible]
- The ark.

114
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:16,080
- It identifies the ark as what in this
cartoon? What is the ark?

115
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,910
- The boat.
- But what is it a symbol of?

116
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,150
- Welcoming.

117
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,740
- Yeah. A symbol of welcoming people,
right? Or a symbol of America itself,

118
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,690
because once you're in, you're in America.
What words or phrases in the cartoon

119
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,530
appear to be the most significant?
All right? Calling the U.S. a refuge tells

120
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,480
us people come here for safety.
- [inaudible]

121
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:53,130
- We'll come back to it. And here, the
sign says no taxes or oppressive kings.

122
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,750
Tell us why people left their countries.

123
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,810
- To get good jobs.
- Yeah. To get jobs.

124
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,330
- To have a better life.

125
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,910
- Right. What were they running away from?

126
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,270
- From paying taxes.

127
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:17,320
- From paying taxes. From kings. Now, any
guesses about what time period people

128
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,552
would have been running away from taxes
and kings?

129
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,140
- 1900s.
- 19th Century.

130
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,070
- The 19th Century, which would be the
1800s, or the 1900s. Both of those time

131
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,740
periods were very big. Kings were a
problem in some places in the world. No

132
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,990
oppressing taxes. Even as far back as the
revolutions in the 1700s, people were

133
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:51,500
dealing with this, okay? So you can use
clues in a cartoon to figure out when the

134
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,410
cartoon was written and sometimes things
like these signs can help you figure that

135
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:04,640
out. All right? List adjectives in the
cartoon and what they mean? What

136
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:12,460
adjectives are in the cartoon? It's on
this sign for one thing.

137
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,840
- Oh. The kings.

138
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,140
- Okay. What did they call the kings?

139
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,400
- Wealthy?

140
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:24,990
- What did they call kings? What kind of
kings did they have? It's kind of hard to

141
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,460
read there. Okay. Here we go. We'll do it
this way.

142
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,580
- Controlling.
- Yeah.

143
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,290
- More powerful than others.
- Expensive [inaudible] can't see...

144
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,480
- I know, I know. So oppressive means it's
controlling. Expensive means they spend

145
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,600
too much money.
- [together] Yeah.

146
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,080
- Compulsory means that you have to do
something. Compulsory military service

147
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,070
means everybody has to join the army. So
some people might be running away from

148
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,910
that because not everyone wants to be in
the army.

149
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,320
- [inaudible]

150
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,520
- The army's a fantastic place, but not
everybody wants to be there. You do

151
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,290
understand, right?
- Yes.

152
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,720
- Okay. Anybody not want to be in the
army?

153
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,470
- I want to serve my country.

154
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,360
- Yeah. Would you want to live in a
country where everybody had to do it?

155
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,588
- [together] No.
- I want to have a choice.

156
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:21,290
- You want to have a choice. I want my
army to have chosen to be there. Right?

157
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,460
Because I don't want a bunch of people
there twiddling their thumbs and not

158
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,270
wanting to be there, okay? Okay. Describe
the action in the cartoon.

159
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,710
- Action?
- I can't cover those.

160
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:38,640
- I forgot to put the space bar. Okay, so
what's happening in the cartoon? We've

161
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,330
already said this.

162
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,190
- Everybody's coming to Uncle Sam.

163
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,112
- And what's happening?

164
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:47,460
- The cloud is trying to get them away
from Uncle Sam.

165
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,910
- Right. All right. What is the message of
the cartoon?

166
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,900
- It's that we have to welcome the
immigrants.

167
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:07,700
- Correct. The message of the cartoon is
that the U.S. is welcoming immigrants who

168
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,440
are trying to get away from places they
don't like. What special interest

169
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,390
groups-- now this one I remembered to put
the extra thing in there so you all have

170
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,790
to think about it. What special interest
groups would agree or disagree with this

171
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:28,250
cartoon? Stop and take a second. Turn to
your partner. See if you can think of

172
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,220
somebody that would like this cartoon and
somebody that would not like this cartoon.

173
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,940
Talk to you partner.
- What is it?

174
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,440
- Okay. A special interest group. Go
ahead, keep talking. A special interest

175
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,900
group is a group that talks to the
government to try to get them to make laws

176
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:59,500
for them, okay? So what kind of group
would agree with the cartoon and what kind

177
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,000
of group would not agree?
