1
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:01,947
- [Teacher] So just leave your
clicker on your table guys.

2
00:00:01,947 --> 00:00:03,282
I mean you can put one in front of you,

3
00:00:03,282 --> 00:00:05,332
just don't turn it on yet,
they're not activated.

4
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,911
Please don't play with them because

5
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:09,462
then the batteries can stay
charged through the day.

6
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,219
Thank you for the help.

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,587
Excellent, thanks.

8
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,035
All right guys, so let's get started

9
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:22,424
with our discussion here.

10
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:24,048
Set the clicker down
please don't play with it,

11
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:25,430
just leave it on the table, thank you.

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,419
I asked you today to
get our thinking going

13
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,302
to answer this question.

14
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:36,082
Danny DeVito is between
4'9" and 5'1" tall.

15
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:40,220
So, i'm 5'10" so Danny DeVito
is either between this tall

16
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,042
or about this tall.

17
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,008
We're not sure on his height.

18
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,710
His wife, Rhea Perlman is 5'0 tall.

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,714
How tall do you think their
sons and daughters will be and why?

20
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:56,005
All right, so please raise
your hand to share your answer,

21
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:59,087
and I'm going to ask you
why you think like you do.

22
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:02,042
So, I'm going to start
back there with Alex.

23
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:05,183
So, turn this way so that I can hear you, 
okay?

24
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:09,824
- [Alex] Okay. I think their
kids would be around 5'

25
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:14,238
because their mom is 5' tall and their dad

26
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:16,790
his middle height is 5'?

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,753
- [Teacher] Okay, so you're
looking at the middle

28
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:22,324
estimated height of Danny DeVito

29
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:25,821
and his wife's height is 5',
so you think together then

30
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:27,973
all their children will
be 5', boys and girls?

31
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:29,244
- [Alex] Mm-hm.

32
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:30,622
- Okay. Great, thank you.

33
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:32,969
What else do you think? J.R.?

34
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:37,014
- I said 5' too. I said 5' as well

35
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:41,302
because that's about

36
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:43,342
how tall they are,

37
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:46,259
so their kid would be around that.

38
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,118
- [Teacher] Okay, so you're looking at

39
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:49,831
kind of his average height and her height,

40
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:51,225
so you think the kids will be around that?

41
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:53,338
Okay, anything different or you
want to explain it further?

42
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:54,594
Michael?

43
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,052
- [Michael] I just said that you get

44
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:58,654
your height from your parents, so

45
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:01,185
whatever the parents were right around 5'

46
00:02:01,185 --> 00:02:04,029
the kids will be about 5'.

47
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:06,146
- [Teacher] Okay, you get your
height from your parents.

48
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:09,037
So, since the parents are
about 5' the kids will be 5'.

49
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,020
Boys and girls?

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,145
- [Michael] Yeah.

51
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,619
- Okay, great. What do you think?

52
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:15,186
- [Student] Well, I think 
the daughter could be 4'9"

53
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:17,438
and the sons would be around 5'2",

54
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:20,108
because both of the parents are shorter,

55
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,847
and so they could be a little bit taller

56
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:26,494
or even a little bit shorter
than one of their parents?

57
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:28,444
- Okay, so even though
the parents are shorter

58
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:31,024
they could be taller or
shorter than the parents,

59
00:02:31,024 --> 00:02:33,784
and you said that the
daughters could be about 4'9"

60
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:35,565
and the sons might be about 5'2"?

61
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,475
- Yes.

62
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:37,593
- Is there a reason why you think

63
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:39,403
the boys would end up being
taller than the girls?

64
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:42,306
- It's just kind of a normal thing.

65
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,442
Normally boys are taller than girls.

66
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,903
- Okay, so a normal thing, boys
are usually taller than girls.

67
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,056
Okay, great.

68
00:02:48,056 --> 00:02:50,363
Any other ideas on the
height of their children?

69
00:02:50,683 --> 00:02:52,648
Adam, what do you think?
Well, what do you think about...

70
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:57,027
- I think that they'll be around,

71
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:58,745
I think boys and girls,
will both be around

72
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,617
5' because it's right inbetween the parents.

73
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:03,799
- [Teacher] Okay, good.

74
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,571
What about me and my family?

75
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:07,223
I'm 5'10".

76
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:09,076
So, I'm tall.

77
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:10,935
What do you think about my family members?

78
00:03:10,935 --> 00:03:13,200
How tall do you think they are?

79
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,033
I'm 5'10", how tall do
you think my mom is?

80
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,809
How tall do you think my dad is?

81
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,035
What's your estimation? What do you think?

82
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:25,214
Raise your hands everybody,
let's participate.

83
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:26,097
Mackenzie what do you think?

84
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:29,463
- I think your dad would be around 6'2"

85
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:34,943
and I think your mom would
be around 5'11" or 5'9"?

86
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,351
- [Teacher] Okay, so my mom
is between 5'9" and 5'11",

87
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,705
so close to my height, and my dad

88
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,201
would be taller, about 6'2".

89
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,468
Brian, what do you think?

90
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,322
- [Brian] I said that I think
your dad would be taller

91
00:03:45,322 --> 00:03:47,505
than you, but then your mom would be

92
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:48,952
around the same height.

93
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,407
- [Teacher] So, my mom
is about the same height

94
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,382
and my dad is taller?

95
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,408
- [Brian] Yeah.

96
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,285
- Anybody think anything. . . 
Pardon me?

97
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:55,910
- [Brian] Or like around 6'.

98
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,434
- [Teacher] My dad would be around 6'?

99
00:03:57,434 --> 00:03:58,627
- [Brian] Yeah.

100
00:03:58,627 --> 00:03:59,334
- [Teacher] What if I tell you



101
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,334
my little brother... 

102
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,605
my little baby brother, is 6'4"?

103
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:04,919
And he is. This is true, he is 6'4".

104
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,846
So, he's a tall guy.

105
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,564
Does that change your ideas about

106
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:09,888
the heights of my parents?

107
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,476
You guys are nodding "yes."

108
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:14,159
What do you think now? Travis?

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,552
- [Travis] Maybe your dad is like 6'4"

110
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:21,033
and your mom is like 5'8"
or 5'9" or something?

111
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,821
- [Teacher] Okay, so Mom is about here,

112
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,793
Dad is taller or 6'4"
like my little brother?

113
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,287
Michael, what do you think?

114
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,088
- Both of them are about 6'.

115
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:31,899
- Both of them are about 6'.

116
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,664
Okay, great, what do you think?

117
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,089
- Well, I know that a lot of people

118
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:36,998
get their traits from their dad, from dads.

119
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:41,071
So, that your dad is taller around 6'5"

120
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:44,298
and then your mom is shorter, like 5'8".

121
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:47,456
- So, you see my height,
and my mom is about 5'8"

122
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,917
and my dad is 6'5", 
so for my brother and I,

123
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:53,539
you're figuring about our traits?

124
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:54,863
What do you mean?

125
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:57,285
- That you get your traits from your dad.

126
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,066
- So, my dad's genes are coming through.

127
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,457
Why do you think that?

128
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:02,574
Why do you think I have
only traits from my dad.

129
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:04,296
- Because I know a lot of
people who get their traits

130
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:06,446
from their dad and more than their mom.

131
00:05:06,446 --> 00:05:10,289
- So, more traits from dad than from mom?

132
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,154
Do you think that's pretty much general?
- [Student] Yeah.

133
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:13,717
Okay, great.

134
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:15,418
Do you guys have anything
to comment on that?

135
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:17,844
What do you think?

136
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:20,056
- I think your dad's probably like 6'2",

137
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:22,888
because my brothers are both
taller than my dad already

138
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,750
and they're still in high school?

139
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,580
- [Teacher] Oh, interesting.

140
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,411
Well, I'll tell you my mom
was 5'11" at her tallest.

141
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,408
Now she's shrinking, she's like 5'9".

142
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:35,554
You know how that happens as you get older

143
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:38,625
and my dad, he's only 6' tall.

144
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,208
So, my little brother is
the tallest in the family

145
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,025
and my other brother, he's 6'1".

146
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,665
So, height does come from both sides,

147
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,726
but my dad's not as tall
you guy's might've thought.

148
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:50,820
Let's talk about Danny DeVito again.

149
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,767
Here he is, our favorite actor, right?

150
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:56,015
Notice his lack of hair, he's bald.

151
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:59,690
The question on here says
"Danny DeVito is bald.

152
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,209
What do you think his son's
hair or lack of will look like

153
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,111
when he's older, and why?"

154
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:07,156
His son, Danny DeVitto has a son.

155
00:06:07,156 --> 00:06:08,938
What do you think about his hair?

156
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,360
Nice and loud so I can hear you.

157
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
Matthew.

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,317
- It said that their son would
have bald hair on the top,

159
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:18,428
but some on the sides?

160
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:21,057
- [Teacher] Some will be bald on the top,

161
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:22,811
but he'll have some hair around the sides.

162
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:24,666
Why do you think that?

163
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,918
- Because usually if somebody's dad's bald

164
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,148
they're not always bald.

165
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,339
- [Teacher] If somebody's dad is bald

166
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,733
they are not always bald?

167
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:34,194
- [Student] I've seen that.

168
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,135
- You've seen that?
That's a good observation, Matt.

169
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:37,562
What do you think?

170
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,089
- [Student] Well, the mom has a lot of hair

171
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,669
and the dad is bald, so I thought, 
he will still have

172
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,969
a lot more hair than his dad.

173
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,402
He wouldn't be completely
bald, but bald on top.

174
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:51,719
- Okay, so mom has a lot
of hair, dad's bald.

175
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,239
So, you think the son will have
hair, but just bald on top?

176
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,263
- Yeah.

177
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:56,879
- So, when you see the
traits being passed down,

178
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,527
how do you see it?

179
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:03,032
- I'm not really sure what
you mean by that question.

180
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:06,863
- You're kind of saying that
he'll have this trait,

181
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:10,339
but he'll also have this trait.

182
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,456
So, how do you see that happening?

183
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:15,686
Did he get all of his traits
from one or all his traits

184
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,613
from another, the son,
or do you think . . .

185
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:18,658
- I think they were combined.

186
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:20,167
- They were combined. The
traits are combined.

187
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,208
Good, Sean?

188
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:25,113
- I thought he would have
like a blackish-brown hair,

189
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:28,789
because that's what the
mom's hair color is.

190
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,617
- [Teacher] Okay?
- He probably wouldn't be bald,

191
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:35,017
but he'd have a receding hairline.

192
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,684
- [Teacher] Okay, so he would
have a receding hairline,

193
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,373
and for those of us that
don't know what that means,

194
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,438
that means when a person
starts to lose their hair,

195
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:43,044
and it kind of inches back and
they're losing their hair.

196
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,710
That's what a receding hairline is.

197
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,383
So, the hair falls out as it moves back.

198
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,599
Are you ready to see what
Danny Devito's kids look like?

199
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,553
Here they are for our predictions.

200
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:57,016
We have his son in the
middle standing taller

201
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:01,010
than everyone else in the
family. He's about 5'5".

202
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,338
So, he's taller than both mom and dad.

203
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,907
This is Danny Devito's
wife, Danny Devito and his son.

204
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:08,277
Here's his daughters.

205
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:11,386
This daughter is about the height of the mom,
but she has big shoes on.

206
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:13,584
The other daughter is taller.

207
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,535
But notice their hair, what do
you notice about their hair?

208
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,702
Ryan, tell me what you
notice about all three kids.

209
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:22,465
- Well, they all have
hair, they're not bald.

210
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:23,749
- [Teacher] They all have
hair, they're not bald.

211
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,205
How would you describe their hair?

212
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,434
- Curly?

213
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,851
- [Teacher] Curly hair. What color?

214
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:28,845
- Black.

215
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,615
- [Teacher] Black or dark
brown, yes very good.

216
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:33,447
All right, so we see that.
Now, when we think about these bunnies,

217
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,279
another question I asked you
is this, look at the picture.

218
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,785
If they had ten offspring,
what do you think

219
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,620
the coats for each bunny would look like?

220
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,197
The fur in what respect,
that was the question.

221
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,670
Nathan, what do you think?

222
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,468
- [Nathan] 25% would be
white, 25% would be black,

223
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:54,449
the remainder would be gray with a little white?
So, part of them will be black

224
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:58,877
and part of them will be white...(inaudible)
So, half of them will be gray... (inaudible)?


225
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:04,839
- [Teacher] Okay, so here's what we have.

226
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,776
I'm going to use abbreviations.

227
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:11,683
25% is white, 25% is black
and 50% will be gray.

228
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:15,543
Nathan says that because one
parent is white, one's black

229
00:09:15,543 --> 00:09:18,476
they'll combine to form a gray color,

230
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,659
just like mixing paint in art class.

231
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,203
Any other predictions?
What else are you thinking?

232
00:09:24,203 --> 00:09:26,207
Let's hear from somebody new.

233
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,858
What else do you think? Omar.

234
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:33,226
- [Omar] I think 40% of the
bunnies are going to be black,

235
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:36,811
40% are white, and 20%
are going to be half black

236
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:41,246
and half white, like a
black bunny with white dots,

237
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:44,345
or a white bunny with black dots.

238
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:48,421
- [Teacher] All right. So, you're
saying 40% black, 40% white,

239
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,811
20% is going to be black and white.

240
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:53,673
You will see both colors.

241
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,775
We'll see black and we'll see white.

242
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,603
Why did you choose 40%, 40% and 20%?

243
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:02,166
- [Omar] Because I think that it's rare

244
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,455
for bunnies to have dots . . .

245
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:08,807
It might be rare for them to have dots.

246
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:12,104
- [Teacher] Okay, so you see
that a solid colored bunny

247
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:15,239
more likely, the probability
is higher for a solid color.

248
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,437
So, that's why you chose 20%?

249
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:19,325
Great, great thinking. Great explanation.

250
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,373
Sean, what do you think?

251
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,435
- I had 20% white,

252
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:27,065
20% black,

253
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:29,655
and the rest are gray.

254
00:10:29,655 --> 00:10:32,607
I would have said 25%, but
you can't have two and a half

255
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:34,284
babies being white.

256
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,753
- Okay.

257
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:39,482
All right, so you would've said 25%.

258
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:41,379
So, you were thinking similarly.

259
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,600
- [Sean] Yeah.

260
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,170
- Why do you say 20%, 20% and 60%?

261
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,070
- Because most of them would be
a mixture of the two,

262
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,950
but a few of them would have to have more

263
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,990
of one of the parent rabbit's traits.

264
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,703
- [Teacher] Okay, so because
they have offspring,

265
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:02,095
the majority will be a mixture
of both of their traits?

266
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:06,251
So, mom and dad will blend
together to create gray,

267
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:09,641
but some of them will
look just like the father,

268
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:11,498
some will look just like the mother,

269
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:14,061
so some will be black, some will be white.

270
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,054
Great. One more idea. 
Kasey what do you think?

271
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,418
- [Kasey] I know in health 
272
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:20,020
that everyone has a dominant feature.

273
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,594
I think white is, so that the majority,

274
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:26,242
so like 40% would be white,
and 20% would be black,

275
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:29,516
and then the rest would be gray.

276
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:32,895
- 40% white, 20% black

277
00:11:32,895 --> 00:11:34,985
and 20% gray.

278
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,711
And you said, because in
health you were learning

279
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:40,118
about dominant features and you believe...
- [Kasey] That's only 80%.

280
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,608
Oh, what did you say for the last one?

281
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,970
- I said the rest.

282
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,715
- Wow, well thanks for paying attention
Good check there guys.

283
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:58,508
- [Kasey] It would be 40%.
- ...60%, we need 40...

284
00:11:58,508 --> 00:11:59,764
Did you say 40?

285
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,245
- [Kasey] I said the rest.

286
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,836
- I was just making up too
many different numbers.

287
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,693
Well, I'm so happy that you
guys are paying attention.

288
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:07,429
I'm going to tell your
math teacher, good job.

289
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,708
Okay, 40% white, but here's what Kasey said

290
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:13,191
that was really good. 
She said that 40% will be white,

291
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,759
because white is dominant.

292
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,022
You used that word.

293
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:18,039
You talked about that
in health a little bit.

294
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,994
So, let's talk about dominant
and what that means.

295
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:24,174
What does it mean? What do
you think dominant means?

296
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:25,799
And be nice and loud for us. John.

297
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:26,983
- Most of?

298
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:29,352
- [Teacher] Most of. Good.
What do you think Sam?

299
00:12:29,352 --> 00:12:31,738
- Main?

300
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,136
- [Teacher] Main... Sean?

301
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:35,180
- The majority?

302
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,668
- [Teacher] The majority...Alex?

303
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,964
- Beat out all others?

304
00:12:38,964 --> 00:12:40,495
- [Teacher] Beat out all others. Nice. 
What do you think, Sean?

305
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,354
- [Sean] Strongest?

306
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:44,351
- [Teacher] Okay. Let me show
you a little example here.

307
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:47,743
So, where do we get our traits, first of all?

308
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,246
Where do we get traits?

309
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:51,572
- [Students] From parents.

310
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,960
- From where?

311
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,984
- [Students] Parents.

312
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,540
- Your parents. Okay, it's passed down.

313
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,324
Traits are passed down and some
come from each parent, right?

314
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,412
Dominant, recessive, some
come from both mom and dad.

315
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,965
If you received a dominant trait . . .

316
00:13:07,965 --> 00:13:10,310
See I labeled this cup
dominant and colored it pink

317
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,376
and you received a recessive trait.

318
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,095
So, half and half, mom and dad.

319
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:17,707
They come together,
which trait do you see?

320
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,428
The dominant one or the recessive one?

321
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:21,828
- [Students] The dominant one.

322
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:23,955
- The dominant one. What if I put it this way.
Which trait do you see?

323
00:13:23,955 --> 00:13:25,741
The dominant one.

324
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:28,443
What if I put two
recessive traits together?

325
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:30,302
- [Students] The recessive.

326
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:33,413
- The recessive, okay. Either way I pair them,
mom or dad, dad or mom.

327
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,456
If I have two dominant
traits that go together,

328
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:36,815
what do I see?

329
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,129
- [Students] Dominant.

330
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,680
- Dominant, okay. So, if the dominant trait
is present, then...

331
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,909
finish the sentence.

332
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:46,988
If the dominant trait is present
in your genes, then what?

333
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,862
- [Kasey] It will show.

334
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,360
- It will show, Kasey says.

335
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,798
That's right, if the dominant
trait is present it will show.

336
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:58,954
Are you guys remembering this
from yesterdays little intro?

337
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:02,550
Okay, let's check this then real quick.

338
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,687
Yesterday you filled out this concept map.

339
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:08,391
Let's make sure that
your answers are correct.

340
00:14:08,391 --> 00:14:11,910
Jsut take a look. So, read this with me.

341
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,960
- [All] "Genetics is the study of heredity,

342
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,524
the passing of traits
from parent to offspring"

343
00:14:20,524 --> 00:14:24,402
and if the offspring has the
same alleles, we call that?

344
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,748
- [Students] Purebred.

345
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:26,840
- And if they have different alleles?

346
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,186
- [Students] Hybrid.

347
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:30,416
- What that means, allele, that word

348
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,391
say that, allele.

349
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:32,296
- [ Students] Allele.

350
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:34,061
- It's the fun word to say
during our genetics unit.

351
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:37,056
That's the form of the
gene, so is it a dominant

352
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:38,998
or is it a recessive.

353
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:41,259
Okay, so let's go back here.
Genetics is the study of . . .

354
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,907
- [Students] Heredity.

355
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:43,813
- The passing of...

356
00:14:43,813 --> 00:14:44,697
- [Students] Traits.

357
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,088
- I don't hear everybody.
Controlled by...

358
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:46,971
- [Students] Genes.

359
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:47,690
- Made of...

360
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,805
- [Students] Alleles.

361
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,919
- Say it again. Alleles.

362
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,080
- [Students] Alleles.

363
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,102
- So genes made of...

364
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,426
- [Students] Alleles.

365
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,749
- Shows when present. We call that...

366
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:55,864
- [Students] Dominant.

367
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:57,326
- And can be masked...

368
00:14:57,326 --> 00:14:58,812
- [Students] Recessive.

369
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:00,322
- Recessive, all right, very good.

370
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,156
Any questions on the concept map?

371
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:05,035
Any corrections if you need
to make them, please do so.

372
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:07,334
All right! Well, let's get going with our lab.

373
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,580
Are you guys ready?

374
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,327
Okay, please take out your lab paper?

375
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,276
We're going to go back to some

376
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:17,896
of those reflection questions later on.

377
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:21,582
Notice the top of the paper.

378
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:25,027
It says "Problem". This is
what we're trying to solve.

379
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:28,389
This is the point of our
scientific investigation.

380
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:32,805
"Are traits controlled by
dominant alleles more common

381
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:36,701
than traits controlled
by recessive alleles."

382
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:40,073
I'd like you, on the lines, to
create your own hypothesis,

383
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,394
or your prediction for this.

384
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:49,447
"Are traits controlled by
dominant alleles more common"

385
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,218
that's the question "are they more common

386
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,958
than traits controlled
by recessive alleles?"

387
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:58,097
So, write down what you think,
write down your prediction.

388
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:02,068
If you can write it in the if-then format

389
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:03,918
of how we do hypotheses, that's preferred,

390
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:06,659
but if that confuses you at this point,

391
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,847
just write what you
think is going to happen.

392
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:12,777
Are dominant alleles more common

393
00:16:14,517 --> 00:16:27,480
than traits controlled
by recessive alleles.

394
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,081
Whatever you think, it's your thinking.

395
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:38,254
We will talk about our
hypotheses in just a moment.

396
00:16:39,093 --> 00:16:41,514
So, once you've written
down your hypothesis,

397
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:47,986
reread it and make sure that
it answers the question.

398
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,328
Then we're going to get
to work using our clickers,

399
00:16:52,328 --> 00:17:28,285
which i'll explain in just a moment.

400
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:34,821
I'd like to hear you share some
hypotheses before we begin.

401
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,934
The question again, "Are traits controlled

402
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:38,907
by dominant alleles
more common than traits

403
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,533
controlled by recessive alleles?"

404
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,773
Please share your
prediction, your hypothesis.

405
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,766
Ronnie.

406
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:49,797
- I said yes, because dominant alleles,

407
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:52,026
it shows over recessive alleles?

408
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:54,696
- So, you believe
dominant will be more common

409
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,856
because they show over recessive alleles.

410
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:57,668
Okay, great.

411
00:17:57,668 --> 00:18:01,585
Girls, one of you share
your hypothesis for me.

412
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:05,663
Who would like to share?

413
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:07,838
Everyones looking at you Kate.

414
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,626
What do you have on your paper?

415
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:13,225
- [Kate] I said that I thought the dominant
alleles were more common?

416
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,722
- You believe the dominant
alleles will be more common.

417
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,086
Okay, great, thank you. 
Another one. Alex?

418
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:22,324
- [Alex] I agreed with it.
I said that I believe that

419
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:24,440
dominant traits were more
common than recessive,

420
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,995
because there's more combinations to get

421
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:28,108
dominant one's over recessive.

422
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,012
- You believe dominant
traits are more common

423
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:32,938
than the recessive, because
there's more combinations...

424
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:34,703
- [Alex] To get that?

425
00:18:34,703 --> 00:18:37,624
- To get to that. To get
the dominant traits to show.

426
00:18:37,624 --> 00:18:41,218
Good. One more. Matthew?

427
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:45,917
- I said that the dominant
traits are less common,

428
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:50,584
because in the picture with Danny DeVito?

429
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:55,344
His son and daughters
didn't look much like him?

430
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:58,247
- Okay, so you believe
that the dominant traits

431
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:01,590
are less common, because in
the example of Danny DeVito,

432
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,702
his kids didn't look much like him.

433
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:07,000
- [Alex] Yeah, and how your younger brother

434
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,370
is 6'4"...

435
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,528
- And how my younger brother is 6'4",

436
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:14,175
but he's taller than
the rest of my family.

437
00:19:14,175 --> 00:19:17,963
Okay, so you're making connections to
our earlier conversation, good.

438
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:22,161
We're going to revisit our
hypotheses after we do this lab.
