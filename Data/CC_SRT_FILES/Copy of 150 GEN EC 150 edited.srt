1
00:00:00,649 --> 00:00:02,298
- [Narrator] She saw sparks in the sky

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:06,146
and a beautiful panda bear
appeared in front of her.

3
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:10,233
- [Panda] Don't be scared, I'm
your Fairy Panda Bear.

4
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:15,277
I will turn you into a beautiful princess

5
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:18,031
so you can go to the parade.

6
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:21,587
- [Daisy] But I don't have anything to wear!

7
00:00:21,848 --> 00:00:26,848
- [Panda] I will wave my bamboo wand
and I will take care of it.

8
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,464
- [Narrator] The Fairy
Panda Bear waved her wand,

9
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:34,464
and suddenly Daisy was
dressed in a lovely gown.

10
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:38,908
On her neck was a dragon
necklace that glowed.

11
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:43,024
- [Panda] Don't forget, when
the fireworks are over

12
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:45,556
the magic is done.

13
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,366
- [Narrator] Daisy walked
up to the celebration,

14
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:50,082
and everyone looked at her.

15
00:00:50,082 --> 00:00:53,194
No one knew who this
beautiful princess was.

16
00:00:53,194 --> 00:00:56,491
The Prince of China saw
her from across the parade.

17
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:59,579
He went right to her and said,

18
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,735
- [Prince] Hello beautiful princess.
I like your outfit.

19
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:08,735
Do you want to hold my
dragon puppet with me?

20
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:10,301
- [Daisy] Sure!

21
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:12,419
- [Narrator] Daisy was
having the best time

22
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,671
of her life at the parade.

23
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,875
Suddenly, she saw the
fireworks show in the night sky

24
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,864
and she knew she must leave
before the magic wore off.

25
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:27,506
- [Daisy] Sorry, I had a wonderful
time but I have to go.

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,018
- [Narrator] Daisy turned
and ran, but she caught

27
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:33,130
her dragon necklace on a
stair post and it fell off.

28
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,708
It stopped glowing as it hit the ground

29
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,981
and the prince picked it up.

30
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:41,698
- [Prince] But I don't even know your name!

31
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:45,686
I feel nervous because
something bad might happen.

32
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:48,571
- [Narrator] The Prince
looked all over town

33
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:52,286
for the girl who would make
the dragon necklace glow.

34
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,343
He went to Daisy's animal farm.

35
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:57,389
Out in the distance the
Prince saw a little shadow

36
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:02,389
by the animal pen. Could that
be the girl from the parade?

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,567
- [Daisy] Can I try the necklace on?

38
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,193
- [Narrator] Daisy tried the necklace on

39
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:12,193
and the prince smiled when the
dragon lit up like the sun.

40
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:16,573
- [Prince] Tomorrow we should be
married, right in the morning.

41
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,313
- [Daisy] Alright, then we shall.

42
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:24,313
- [Everyone] And they
lived happily ever after.

43
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:29,765
(Applause)

44
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,755
- [Ms. Turner] Let's give our puppeteers
a round of applause!

45
00:02:31,755 --> 00:02:33,600
- [Audience Member]
Bravo! Bravo! (whooping)

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,570
- [Ms. Turner] That was awesome you guys!

47
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:40,705
(Audience Chatter)

48
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:41,680
- [Ms. Turner] Class?

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,864
- [Class] Yes!

50
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,908
- [Ms. Turner] You're going to earn
yourself another smiley.

51
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:45,906
Class class class?

52
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:47,485
- [Class] Yes yes yes!

53
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:50,016
- [Ms. Turner] Boys and girls if you
are on the list of children

54
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,943
that are going to go out
to work on an art project

55
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:55,008
could you quietly stand
up and walk to the door?

56
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,980
If you are staying in
with me for our work,

57
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,411
will you sit hip-to-hip with the 
person that... (Background Chatter)

58
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,758
I'll get it. (Background Chatter)

59
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:06,966
No, Ms. Turner wants to do it.

60
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,079
Please sit hip-to-hip with your partner.

61
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:11,793
Good job Zoe that was awesome!

62
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:19,303
That was so cool. (Background Chatter)

63
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,920
Okay, just a second then.

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,682
Alright, (singing) ♫
turn your bodies this way ♫

65
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,586
- [Class] (singing) ♫ Okay ♫

66
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,490
- [Miss Turner] (singing)
♫ Criss-cross applesauce ♫

67
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,578
- [Everyone] (singing) ♫ Okay ♫

68
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,437
- [Teacher] Who's your partner?

69
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:33,923
- [Student] Zoe.

70
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:36,245
- [Teacher] Can you sit hip-to-hip with her?

71
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:39,124
DeShaun face this way.

72
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:42,723
Alright, if your legs are
criss-crossed then look up here.

73
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,861
Wow. Theodore why don't you pop up

74
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:45,834
and go close the door for me.

75
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:49,136
Alright, this morning
when we were talking about

76
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:53,218
the books about China, Xander
wrote down a lot of the things

77
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,114
we were talking about that
were different between

78
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:57,467
us and the people that live in China.

79
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,917
So as a class we figured out that

80
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:02,204
they have a different flag,

81
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:05,083
they eat with chopsticks,
which is really neat,

82
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:06,290
- [Child] We do too.

83
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,586
- [Ms. Turner] Sometimes we do, 
right? They have a different alphabet,

84
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:12,629
they have water buffalos there,

85
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,160
they have the Great Wall of China,

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,994
and they speak a different language.

87
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,596
And they also have dragon puppets

88
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:21,197
which you just saw on the...

89
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:23,426
- [Everyone] Puppet show!

90
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:25,794
- [Ms. Turner] What we're gonna to do now
is we're gonna talk about

91
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:28,975
things that are the
same between our culture

92
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:31,622
and the Chinese culture
and we're gonna use

93
00:04:31,622 --> 00:04:33,247
our listening stones.

94
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:35,825
So Toban, I'm gonna be coming around

95
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:37,775
and I'm gonna give a listening stone

96
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:40,469
to one of the people in the group,

97
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:43,232
and if you're holding the listening stone

98
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:46,320
you're gonna say one thing that's the same

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,456
and then you're gonna
pass it to your partner

100
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:51,892
and they're going to say
one thing that's the same.

101
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,169
And then they're gonna pass it back,

102
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,609
and we're gonna go back and forth

103
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:58,299
and see if we can start to
talk about what's the same.

104
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,227
We know a lot of things
that are different.

105
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:02,665
I'm curious of what's the same.

106
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:05,567
Could you please sit
knee-to-knee with your partner?

107
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,819
Can we show them
knee-to-knee Zoe? Like this?

108
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,819
Facing your partner, like
we do-- There you go!

109
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,365
I'll give you a Band-Aid
in a minute Finn, okay?

110
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:20,365
Can you sit knee-to-knee
with Graham? Like this?

111
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:25,159
- [Child] I have another
thing that is dis--

112
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,273
- [Ms. Turner] Another
thing that's different?

113
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:26,737
- [Child] Uh-huh.

114
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:27,480
- [Ms. Turner] What?

115
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,803
- [Child] They have more dramatic
designs on their clothes.

116
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:31,778
- [Ms. Turner] They have
more dramatic designs

117
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:34,373
on their clothes? We saw that
in our research material.

118
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,692
As soon as you get the listening
stone, I want you to say

119
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,674
something that's the same--
and RJ you might want to

120
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,211
start saying like, "we both..."

121
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,838
might be a way to help okay?

122
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,647
(whispers) RJ you have
the listening stone.

123
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:51,965
Okay? So look at Zoe, listen
with your eyes and your body

124
00:05:51,965 --> 00:05:54,403
and say, "we both..."

125
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:56,214
and see how many things you can think of.

126
00:05:56,214 --> 00:06:00,556
(Background Chatter)

127
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:02,599
- [Student] Can I be the stone keeper?

128
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,946
- [Ms. Turner] You may, yes.

129
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,949
- [Child] We are the same
as them, because we all...

130
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,949
(Background Chatter)

131
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,717
- [Child] We all have eyes.

132
00:06:17,717 --> 00:06:20,253
- [Ms. Turner] We all have eyes, yep.

133
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:25,152
- [Student] We all have clothing.

134
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:30,152
- [Student] We all have hands. We both can see!

135
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:37,152
- [Student] We are the same as them.

136
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:38,874
- [Ms. Turner] How are
we the same as them?

137
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:42,287
- [Student] We wear clothes.

138
00:06:42,287 --> 00:06:44,818
- [Ms. Turner] We all have
to wear clothes, right?

139
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,024
- [Student] We all have beds?

140
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,137
- [Ms. Turner] We all have beds.

141
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,695
- [Student] Can we do something different?

142
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,593
- [Ms. Turner] You may say
something different, yeah.

143
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:03,154
- [Student] We both have to sit down.

144
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:06,692
- [Student] We both have a mouth.

145
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:12,059
- [Ms. Turner] We all have hair, yep.

146
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,283
- [Student] No, some people can be bald.

147
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,239
- [Ms. Turner] That's true, 
some people can be bald.

148
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:18,212
What else between us and the
Chinese culture is the same?

149
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,715
We all have shoes.

150
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:25,715
(Background Chatter)

151
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,675
We can all walk and we can all do things.

152
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:33,984
- [Student] We all have bodies.

153
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:36,160
- [Ms. Turner] Did you guys see 
anything from the puppet show

154
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,178
that made you think of something
that's the same between us?

155
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:40,014
What?

156
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:45,327
- [Student] We all can make things.

157
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:48,655
- [Teacher] We can all create things
and be really creative.

158
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:49,770
Did you see something from the puppet show

159
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,785
that made you think we were the same?

160
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:57,348
(Background Chatter)

161
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:02,355
- [Ms. Turner] We all have clothes.
Did you see the clothes

162
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:07,161
on the puppet show?

163
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,900
- [Student] We all have dragon puppets?

164
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,942
- [Ms. Turner] There are a lot of dragon
puppets at Chinese New Year.

165
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,265
- [Student] Oh, we all have puppets.

166
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:16,006
- [Teacher] We all use puppets.

167
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,492
- [Other Student] That's what I was just going to say!

168
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:20,581
- [Teacher] Okay, we all use puppets.

169
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:23,646
- [Student] We all have an alphabet.

170
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:26,618
- [Teacher] We all have an alphabet,
even though it looks different.

171
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:29,678
Alright I'm going to see if
we can earn another point.

172
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:30,542
Class?

173
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,511
- [Class] Yes?

174
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,585
- [Ms. Turner] (gasps) That was so good.

175
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:42,315
Boys and girls hey, can everyone
turn their bodies this way?

176
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:45,896
Alright let's share out
now, we had the chance

177
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:47,150
to pass the stone back and forth,

178
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,725
I just wanted to quickly
hear one thing per group

179
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:53,396
of something that you
thought of that was the same.

180
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,091
Zoe and RJ can you tell me one thing

181
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,855
that you talked about in your group?

182
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,666
- [Zoe] We both have imaginations.

183
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:00,338
- [Ms. Turner] We both have imaginations!

184
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:02,730
- [Zoe] And RJ said we both have brains.

185
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,887
- [Ms. Turner] We're all pretty smart
aren't we? Finn and Graham,

186
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,499
can you tell me something
that was the same?

187
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,443
- [Finn] We both see.

188
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:12,958
- [Ms. Turner] We both see.

189
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,560
- [Graham] We both have rotten teeth.

190
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,324
- [Ms. Turner] What do you mean by that?

191
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,391
- [Graham] We sometimes all have rotten teeth.

192
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,504
- [Ms. Turner] We have to
go to the dentist sometimes?

193
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:23,313
Yeah, okay. Xander and Nazarette,

194
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,819
what did you guys find in your group?

195
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:31,254
What? You tell me, what's
the same? We both...

196
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:36,254
- [Xander] We both can make things
like necklaces and fireworks

197
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,354
and actually Chinese people
were the first people

198
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:46,354
to invent gunpowder and
that's what makes fireworks.

199
00:09:46,788 --> 00:09:48,413
- [Ms. Turner] Did you
hear that boys and girls?

200
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,085
Finn did you hear what Xander said?

201
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:54,211
He said that the Chinese were
the first to invent fireworks.

202
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:57,208
- [Xander] Because they were the
first to invent gunpowder

203
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:01,601
and gunpowder is what
powers the fireworks a lot.

204
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:06,408
- [Ms. Turner] That's cool.

205
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:08,079
Wait wait wait, it's
Anna and Toban's turn.

206
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,262
Anna and Toban, tell me
something that's the same.

207
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:11,098
- [Anna] We both have families.

208
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:13,907
- [Ms. Turner] We both have families.
Did you think of one Toban?

209
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:17,088
- [Toban] We all have dragons.

210
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:18,714
- [Ms. Turner] We all have dragons?

211
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:19,550
- [Toban] What does that say?

212
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,036
- [Ms. Turner] I'll tell you in 
just a minute, okay?

213
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:23,265
And DeShaun and Gabrielle
you're the last ones.

214
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,774
What's something from your group?

215
00:10:24,774 --> 00:10:28,257
- [Gabrielle] We talked about...

216
00:10:28,257 --> 00:10:29,418
- [Ms. Turner] We both...

217
00:10:29,418 --> 00:10:34,418
- [Gabrielle] We both...(mumbles)

218
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:39,913
- [Ms. Turner] What's
something that's the same?

219
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:42,954
- [Gabrielle] We all have rainbows.

220
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:45,717
- [Ms. Turner] We all have rainbows? 
Yeah, they see rainbows in China

221
00:10:45,717 --> 00:10:48,481
and we see rainbows here.
And DeShaun what about you?

222
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,431
What's something that's the same

223
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,335
between us and the people in China?

224
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:55,841
- [DeShaun] We're gonna have the
same melanin as somebody.

225
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,559
- [Ms. Turner] We have the same melanin?

226
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,418
- [DeShaun] Yeah.

227
00:10:58,418 --> 00:10:59,324
- [Ms. Turner] What do you mean by,

228
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,483
"we have the same melanin as somebody?"

229
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:02,969
Here sit up so I can hear you.

230
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,221
- [Little Girl] I think he means we have

231
00:11:05,221 --> 00:11:07,358
the same melanin in our skin.

232
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,844
- [Ms. Turner] We have the
same melanin in our skin?

233
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:11,351
- [Zoe] Cuz we
both have light skin.

234
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:13,975
- [Anna] Yeah but what if the
people in Africa have...

235
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:15,882
- [Student] I'm not talking about them.

236
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:17,411
- [Ms. Turner] The people
in Africa have dark skin,

237
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,455
they have more...

238
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:20,592
melanin.

239
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,311
- [Anna] Yeah but the people in Asheville.

240
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:27,116
- [Ms. Turner] Oh, in Asheville. In our
city we have lots of different

241
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:29,507
colors of skin and
different kinds of melanin

242
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:34,385
but in China did it look like
their skin was pretty similar?

243
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,381
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:38,309
Alright, so this is what we're gonna do.

245
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:40,236
Does everyone see these circles over here?

246
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,397
- [Class] Yeah.

247
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:43,347
- [Ms. Turner] You're gonna come up
and you're gonna pick one

248
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:48,347
off our chart and you're
gonna go draw a picture

249
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,893
of something that's the same between us

250
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,704
and the people in China
and then you're gonna come

251
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:54,237
and you're gonna stick it back up.

252
00:11:54,237 --> 00:11:56,837
And this is actually a word bubble chart.

253
00:11:56,837 --> 00:11:58,866
Okay? So when I see you're sitting nicely

254
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,993
I'm gonna call you up and
you come pick your color

255
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:04,662
and I have brand new markers at the table.

256
00:12:04,662 --> 00:12:09,345
Alright, Zoe and Finn
come pick your color.

257
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:18,625
Xander and Nancy come pick your circle.

258
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,610
You're gonna draw a picture
of something that's the same

259
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,816
between us and the Chinese culture.

260
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:29,692
You can write words too.
Okay, the rest of you.

261
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:32,904
It says, "We will go on hug patrol today."

262
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:35,125
We're gonna see if we can earn it.

263
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,728
You're gonna do orange?

264
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:41,308
- [Little Girl] I wanna do pink.

265
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:46,308
(Background Chatter)

266
- [Student] Can I do green?

267
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:52,787
- [Ms. Turner] You have to do orange or...

268
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:58,833
Alright. So what's the
same boys and girls?

269
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:00,637
Thank you.

270
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:05,637
(Background Chatter)

271
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,296
- [Ms. Turner] I love brand new markers!

272
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:18,226
- [Anna] We have to do
something on the same.

273
00:13:18,226 --> 00:13:20,525
- [Ms. Turner] Something that's the same.

274
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:21,894
Anna what are you gonna do?

275
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,311
- [Anna] We all have families.

276
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,075
- [Ms. Turner] We all have families.

277
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,283
- [Toban] Can I sit by Anna?

278
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:29,975
- [Little Girl] I'm doing green.

279
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,335
- [Ms. Turner] Can you sit by Anna, yes.

280
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,194
Anna, Toban's gonna sit next to you.

281
00:13:37,424 --> 00:13:41,846
Sometimes you can say, "we both..."

282
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,372
Or "we all..."

283
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:50,167
(Background Chatter)

284
00:13:58,345 --> 00:13:59,972
- [Ms. Turner] Xander that was cool.

285
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:04,972
How do you spell melanin?
You just sound it out.

286
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,304
We all have brains,
we're all pretty smart?

287
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:13,764
Can you write that in words on there?

288
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:17,456
You guys are such good writers.

289
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,290
RJ, what are you writing?

290
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,630
what are you writing RJ?

291
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,652
Can you read it to me?

292
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:30,840
What do you mean by it,
"we all have rooms"?

293
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,873
- [RJ] We all have our rooms.

294
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,439
- [Ms. Turner] We all have art rooms?

295
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:35,159
- [RJ] Bedrooms.

296
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,164
- [Ms. Turner] Oh bedrooms, we all have bedrooms.

297
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:46,751
We're gonna make a word bubble.

298
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,347
Can you read it to me? We all...

299
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:52,364
- [Finn] We all have a heart.

300
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:55,981
- [Ms. Turner] We all have a heart.
