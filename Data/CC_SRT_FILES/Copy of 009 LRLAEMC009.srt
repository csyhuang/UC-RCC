1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,220
- All right. We've been talking about
listening and viewing. I have our chart to

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,580
help us out, and I wanna see if you can
tell me what effective and respectful

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,010
listening and viewing looks like. Matthew.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,730
- Um, looking.

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,710
- Looking. Okay, so our eyes need to be...?

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,450
- [Together] Watching.
- Watching. Christopher.

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,110
- Hands.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,040
- Oh, what do our hands need to be doing?

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,620
- Still.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,939
- They need to be still. Matthew Pelkey.

11
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,911
- Mouth shut.
- Our mouth shut. Our lips are...

12
00:00:34,911 --> 00:00:37,094
- Closed.
- Closed. Collin.

13
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:40,299
- Don't lay on the carpet. Don't be silly.

14
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:44,525
- That's right. So tell me. Help her out,
Jacob. Our feet what?

15
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:45,570
- Be quiet.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,748
- Our feet need to be quiet. Maddie, can
you help me out with one more? We've done

17
00:00:50,748 --> 00:01:00,713
eyes watching, lips closed, feet are
quiet. What do we need to do? Who can help

18
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,570
her out? Alice, I see your hand raised.

19
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:07,006
- Ears.
- Listening.

20
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:12,648
- Ears listening. And one more. Let me see
if-

21
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,622
- Hands to yourself.
- Adam.

22
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:16,387
- Keep your hands to yourself.

23
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:21,286
- Hands are still. Okay, so let's do our
checklist. We said eyes watching. Let me

24
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:25,740
see those beautiful eyes. I don't see
Layla's. I need you to turn your body.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,690
Very good. Next, ears listening. Does
everyone have their ears listening? Next,

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,175
lips are...
- Closed.

27
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:37,122
- Unless I call on you, just like I did
with all of our helpers, hands are...

28
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,515
- Still.

29
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,860
- Still. So Catherine, I'll tie that shoe
in just a minute. You put your hands still

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,520
in your lap. Perfect.
And our feet are...

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,000
- Quiet.

32
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,070
- Oh, I love it. Are we ready to view our
video?

33
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,000
- Yes.

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,710
- Perfect. Okay. I want to be sure you can
see before we begin, because we're going

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:00,410
to turn out our lights. All right, what do
we want to find out? I want you to watch

36
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,910
for what type of weather you see. What are
we watching for?

37
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,720
- What type of weather.

38
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,410
- Weather. And what tools are the children
using to observe that weather? So the

39
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:20,180
second thing we need to watch for? Tools.
Listen and watch for the tools. And have

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,540
we had an experience like that? So let me
see those beautiful eyes. Let me see them.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,580
Face forward. Lights helper. Where's my
lights helper?

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,350
- Claire.

43
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,390
- Claire, would you mind turning out our
lights? Okay. Do we know what we're

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,907
listening-
- Yeah.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,970
- ...and watching for? Okay. Eyes
forward. I'm going to be seeing who's

46
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,246
doing their job. Ready.

47
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:50,340
- The wind is blowing my hair, but then
it's very strong today. We decided to blow

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,760
bubbles. They're blowing away. That's
Oliver blowing bubbles, too. Oh, Amy's

49
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:05,435
bubble just blew away. It was so windy,
the wind is making the bubbles.

50
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:10,590
- The wind's pushing out the bubbles, and
then the bubble comes out.

51
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:18,109
- We didn't even do anything. All we did
is hold up the bubble wand.

52
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:18,620
- Whoa.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,030
- You can't see the wind, but you can see
what it's doing.

54
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,210
- That looks like fun.

55
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:28,674
- What are they doing?

56
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:32,946
- My dad gave us some old sheets to tear
up so we could make some streamers.

57
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,429
- Is he having fun?

58
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:39,982
- That's Oliver, and the streamer just
went in his face.

59
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,463
- What are they doing?

60
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:47,366
- Let's see what they're doing. Let's
watch.

61
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:52,866
- I was pretending the streamers were the
hair of this pig, because the little knot

62
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:58,280
is really shaped like a head, and the rest
of the stick is their body. And if they

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,330
have branches growing on them, that's to
me their hands and their legs, or

64
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,220
something.

65
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,024
- All right. It was very short. Well, did
you enjoy that?

66
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:12,100
- Yeah.
- I want to see that again.

67
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,228
- Good.
Go turn on our lights.

68
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:14,971
- Again.

69
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:20,560
- Now. Oh, we might watch it again later.
So let me see if you were listening and

70
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,760
viewing our video. I'm going to check by
answering these questions. Now, if you

71
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,560
know the answer, what are you going to do?

72
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:28,980
- Raise your hand.

73
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,710
- Raise your hand.

74
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:36,800
- What weather did you see? Let me see
someone I haven't heard from. Emily, what

75
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,950
type of weather did we see?

76
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,815
- Blowing.

77
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:42,162
- It was blowing what?

78
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,000
- Bubbles.
- Wind.

79
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,829
- Wind. Blowing wind.

80
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:52,330
- What tools were the children using to
observe the weather?

81
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:52,690
- Bubbles!

82
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,870
- Bubbles. And what did they do?

83
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,140
- They ripped the paper.

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,899
- They ripped them, and they put them on
the stick. Have we had a similar

85
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,592
experience?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,521
- Yeah, for the bubbles.

87
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:09,492
- Yeah, let me see who's... let me see
who I haven't heard from. Clara, what did

88
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:10,397
we do?

89
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:12,394
- We blowed bubbles.

90
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,136
- We blew bubbles. Did we have to go like
this?

91
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:16,295
- No.
- Did we have to do that?

92
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:16,830
- No.

93
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,356
- What happened when we put it in the
bubble solution and put it up? What

94
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:21,400
happened?
- The wind blew it.

95
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,514
- The bubbles blowed out.

96
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:25,951
- All right. So now we're going to do a
think-

97
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,458
- [Together] Pair share.

98
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,770
- I want you to turn to your partner that
you talked to yesterday.

99
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,410
- Okay.

100
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,550
- I want you to share how you observed the
wind. We had a lot of windy weather

101
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,840
yesterday. Talk to your partner about
where you observed the wind.

102
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,872
Emily, she'll be right back. You be
thinking. Jacob, what did you see

103
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,160
yesterday?

104
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,400
- [inaudible]

105
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,351
- Wind. How did you see it?

106
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,440
- [inaudible]

107
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
- What did it blow?
- [inaudible]

108
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:04,242
- The trees? It blew the bubbles the other
day. Collin, what did you see?

109
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:05,914
- [inaudible]

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,707
- Perfect. I like that. You used the tools
we made in school. Marcus? Are you back?

111
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:25,676
All right, we just got through watching
our video, talking about our wind

112
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:32,060
observations. Now I want you to tell me
what effective speakers do. I'm going to

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,940
call on some people I haven't heard from
yet. Marshall, tell me one thing an

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,290
effective speaker does.

115
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,490
- Speaks slowly.

116
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,010
- Speaks slowly. All right, let's see what
else effective speakers do.

117
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,732
- They keep their eyes on the audience.

118
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:54,492
- Eyes on the audience, just like mine are
on you right now. Bronwen, show that

119
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:55,710
you're listening. Raven?

120
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,464
- [inaudible]

121
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:04,128
- Show your work. I want to see that
beautiful work. Who else has read? Who can

122
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:07,658
tell me another one? Who have I not heard
from today? Who have I not heard from

123
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:08,354
today?
- You haven't...

124
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:11,460
- Wesley. Wesley, what else should a good
speaker do?

125
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,080
- Volume up.

126
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,950
- Huh?

127
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,262
- Volume up.

128
00:07:16,262 --> 00:07:21,980
- Volume up. We want to hear what you have
to say. All right. Clara, tell me

129
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,688
something else.
- Be still.

130
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,360
- All right. Oh, you need to stand still.
Should you sway back and forth when you're

131
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,450
presenting your work?

132
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,740
- No.
- No. Okay.

133
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,130
- Have we covered it all?

134
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,350
- Yes.

135
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,260
- Let's see. Let's remind ourselves. Look
at your-

136
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,990
- [Together] Audience.

137
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,110
- Speak-

138
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,590
- [Together] Slowly.

139
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,917
- Stand-

140
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,356
- [Together] Still.

141
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:46,120
- Volume-

142
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,632
- [Together] Up.

143
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:48,080
- Show your-

144
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,931
- [Together] Work.

145
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:57,580
- Okay. Now remember, don't hold up your
thumbs up sign until I ask if that person

146
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:07,380
did these jobs. My first speaker is
Holland. Holland, will you please come up?

147
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,010
Okay. Okay, go ahead.

148
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,700
- I can see the wind blow a horse's..

149
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,590
- Huh? Horse's what?

150
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,513
- Tail.

151
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:21,186
- Okay.

152
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:29,420
Did Holland look at the audience when
she presented her work?

153
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,398
- Yes.
- What do you think?

154
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:31,430
- Good.

155
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,570
- Hold up those thumbs up signs. We want
to give her good feedback. Put your thumbs

156
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:45,470
up sign down. Thank you, Holland. My next
speaker is Alice. Alice. Thank you for

157
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:54,405
choosing a safe path. Come on. Good.
All right. Let's watch our speaker.

158
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:55,102
Remember.

159
00:08:55,102 --> 00:09:05,713
- I can see the wind blow grass.

160
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:10,729
- All right. Did Alice speak slowly?

161
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:12,400
- Yes.

162
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:19,570
- Thumbs up sign. Awesome. Put your thumbs
up sign down. My next speaker. Yes, Fran.

163
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,549
What do you want?

164
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:23,058
- [inaudible]

165
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,429
- Wesley, please come up. Cathy, just look
through your window. I know we're close

166
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:31,196
today.

167
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,066
- I can see the wind blow the roofs.

168
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,944
- Did Wesley stand still?

169
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,592
- Yes.
- Yes.

170
00:09:47,592 --> 00:09:55,660
Good job. All right. Thumbs up sign if
he, yeah, if he stood still. Good. Our

171
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:11,320
next speaker, Sofia. Sofia, come up.
Okay, let's start out like this. Loudly.

172
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,685
- I can see the wind blow

173
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:16,243
[inaudible].

174
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:22,698
- Did Sofia have her volume up?

175
00:10:22,698 --> 00:10:23,185
- Yeah.

176
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:27,690
- She did a much better job. Let's give
her those thumbs up signs. Good job. Oh, I

177
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,958
don't see everyone's. Thank you, Adam.
Good. Thumbs up sign down. Matthew Bashir.

178
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,360
- I can...

179
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,500
- Oh, hold on. Are your friends listening
to you? Let me see if you're remembering,

180
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,730
if your eyes are watching and your ears
are listening. Christopher, we want to see

181
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,651
you look at the speaker. Turn your body
this way, please. Thank you.

182
00:10:56,651 --> 00:11:03,896
- I can see the wind blow kites.

183
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:07,740
- Very good. Show your work. Oh, they've
already got those thumbs up signs.

184
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,670
Friends, do you believe that he showed his
work? Is he showing everyone? Good. Why,

185
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,987
thank you, Matthew.
- What does that say?

186
00:11:15,987 --> 00:11:18,589
- Hmm?
- Why is the

187
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:19,800
[inaudible]?

188
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:22,791
- What is that? His kite is in the shape
of a...

189
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,976
- Star.

190
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:29,665
- Star. Isn't that beautiful? I love those
details. Catherine, your turn.

191
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,104
- I can...

192
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:39,354
- Oh, hold on one second. I'm sorry to
interrupt. Eyes forward. Eyes forward.

193
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:40,329
Good job.

194
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:53,449
- I can see the wind blow my star. I can
see the wind blow leaves.

195
00:11:53,449 --> 00:12:00,299
- She wrote two sentences. Show your work.
Very good. Did Catherine look at her

196
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,319
audience when she presented her work?
- Yes.

197
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:07,401
- Good. Thumbs up signs. Christopher,
Romley, Emily, we want to see your eyes up

198
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:16,898
here. Thank you. Aiden. Aiden. All right,
Aiden, we're going to do a quick check.

199
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:23,562
May I please have this? It's okay.
Accidents do happen. I just didn't want

200
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:24,723
you to get hurt.

201
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:26,488
- What get hurt?

202
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:30,360
- Because you're holding it... we want
to be safe with our materials.

203
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:38,283
Criss-cross. Very good. Aiden, I love the
details in your picture.

204
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:46,573
- I can see the wind blow...

205
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:48,314
- Down.

206
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:51,821
- ...down the tree.

207
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:59,622
- Show your work. Nice. Oh, thumbs up
signs. He spoke very slowly.
