10
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:27,563

11
00:00:27,563 --> 00:00:28,446

12
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:29,444
- Anything but doe.

13
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:32,257
What are we going to
start the answer with?

14
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,302

(inaudible)

17
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,265
Yeah, you can actually
start with doe, okay?

18
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,749
So this is really anything, okay?

19
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,605
And then anything else
for anything in between.

20
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:43,395
Got it?

21
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,425
(inaudible)

22
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:55,989
What part?

23
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:02,225
We have 15 R's.

24
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:05,011
And we have a five note scale.

25
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:06,149
Abby?

26
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,401
(inaudible)

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:13,649
The C's and the E?

28
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:19,851
(singing notes)

29
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:21,384
(inaudible)

30
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:23,407
Big it.

31
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,531
There we go.

32
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,086
(inaudible)

33
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,874
Eggs and bacon are coming off.

34
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:31,171
Two eggs, whoops, one bacon.

35
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,984
Here we go.

36
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:33,447
John, before you go to your instrument

37
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:36,047
boys and girls-- (inaudible)

38
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:37,580
Yeah, well, my shoe fell off.

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,903
Can I have these two rows

40
00:01:38,903 --> 00:01:40,877
speak the question and these two rows

41
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:41,829
speak the answer?

42
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:44,383
Just so we solidify the rhythm.

43
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,823
Ready?

44
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,471
Speak in pack, speak in pack.

45
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,816
Ready, set, speaking first.

46
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:52,277
Valentines, valentines.

47
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:54,130
Pink, red and blue.

48
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,059
Now you.

49
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,474
I made a pretty one,

50
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:59,485
just for you.

51
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,645
Switch please.

52
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,876
Question answer.

53
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:02,944
Ready, begin.

54
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:05,359
Valentines, valentines.

55
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,006
Pink, red and blue.

56
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:12,505
I made a pretty one just for you.

57
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:15,686
Okay, two jobs when you
get to your instrument.

58
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:18,101
Remove eggs and bacon by drawing

59
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,378
your fingernails down the nail

60
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:22,861
and pulling towards you.

61
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:24,742
Job number one always in this classroom

62
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:26,553
is not to talk while I'm talking,

63
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,271
thank you.

64
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,873
Job number two,

65
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:30,964
make your X.

66
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,613
One, take off bars.

67
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:34,573
Two, make your X.

68
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:35,386
Ben J.

(inaudible)

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,776
That's my instrument.

71
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,565
Thank you.

72
00:02:39,565 --> 00:02:44,697
I'm going to move it now.

73
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:48,574
Yeah there's (inaudible).

74
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:50,177
Okay, I've already set my instrument,

75
00:02:50,177 --> 00:02:52,568
anybody not get a turn on the basses yet

76
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,193
this year?

77
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:55,937
Not had a turn on the basses yet.

78
00:02:55,937 --> 00:02:56,935
- Everybody had a turn.

79
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:58,444
- I haven't.
- Yeah, you have.

80
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,904
(background chatter)

81
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:03,947
- Okay, let's have Josh and Britney go

82
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:07,268
to the back row and start their jobs.

83
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:10,077
(background chatter)

84
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:12,120
Oh my gosh, we do not have time.

85
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,441
Go!

86
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:24,659
That row may go.

87
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,719
Okay, you're about two
seconds too late on that.

88
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,828
Your row may go now.

89
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:35,966
Draw your finger to the top

90
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,638
of the nail and pull it towards you.

91
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:39,356
Sabrina?

92
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:41,005
Egg, oh they're wrong?

93
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,443
Okay, eggs and bacon.

94
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:48,017
Agata's row may go.

95
00:03:48,017 --> 00:03:49,506
And the last row may go.

96
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:59,825
(background chatter)

97
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,913
- How come on this (inaudible)
it says H equals B?

98
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:04,074
- 'Cause in Germany they don't have

99
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,164
B, they have H.

100
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,766
We have instruments made in Germany.

101
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:23,614
(background chatter)

102
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:25,928
Josh is ready, Britney's ready.

103
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:29,033
(background chatter)

104
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,497
Ben is ready.

105
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:37,999
Abby's ready.

106
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,322
All right, boys and girls.

107
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,667
You have two does on
your instrument, two F's.

108
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:43,582
Would you locate one, yes?

109
00:04:43,582 --> 00:05:05,106
(background chatter)

110
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,010
You have two F's, locate one and hover

111
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,089
both mallets above one?

112
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,084
Hold question on F.

113
00:05:12,084 --> 00:05:15,967
Speaking and playing alternating bounce C.

114
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,823
Ready, set and here we go.

115
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:24,024
(xylophone music)

116
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,696
Stop, we gotta do it again because

117
00:05:25,696 --> 00:05:27,065
Josh remembered half way through

118
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,203
that he was supposed to speak while

119
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,062
he played.

120
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,061
Let's try it again, Josh.

121
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:32,592
Ready, set, and here we go.

122
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:37,107
(xylophone music)

123
00:05:37,107 --> 00:05:38,116
Excellent.

124
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:40,113
Answer on the other F.

125
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,762
Hold answer on the other F.

126
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:44,316
Ready, set and here we go.

127
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:48,630
(xylophone music)

128
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,813
Yeah, we're going to try the answer again

129
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:52,996
just some of you might have messed up

130
00:05:52,996 --> 00:05:54,110
the rhythm.

131
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,734
Ready, set, and here we answer.

132
00:05:56,734 --> 00:06:01,408
(xylophone music)

133
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,825
Make your X.

134
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:06,006
This time you're to do the question again,

135
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,908
but you may use two bars this time.

136
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:12,136
But we have to start beating the question

137
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,134
on what mill?

138
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:14,063
- [Children] F.

139
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,874
- F, so one of your bars must be F.

140
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,894
The other bar has to be next door

141
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:19,960
to F in either direction.

142
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,936
Here we go.

143
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,004
Question only.

144
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:24,906
Starting on F, only using two bars.

145
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:27,460
Ready, set, and here we go.

146
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,800
(xylophone music)

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,121
Uh oh, what are we not supposed to

148
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:38,791
end the question over?

149
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:39,557
Dawn?

150
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:40,254
- F?

151
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:43,040
- F, this time you may use your whole

152
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,942
instrument for the question, you have

153
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:50,331
to start on F but don't end on F.

154
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,047
Ready, set and get question

155
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:53,722
here we go.

156
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:59,690
(xylophone music)

157
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,826
Good, didn't hear anybody end on F.

158
00:07:01,826 --> 00:07:05,332
I did, make your X for a second.

159
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:07,189
I heard some people's questions

160
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:09,836
that maybe sounded like this.

161
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:14,103
(xylophone music)

162
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,676
I don't really remember
what notes I played,

163
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:20,765
I was just kinda doing
whatever I wanted to

164
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:24,531
up and down up and down.

165
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,505
Could I sing that?

166
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,248
- No?

167
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,964
♫ Valentine, valentine ♫

168
00:07:29,964 --> 00:07:32,700
- [Teacher] Probably not.

169
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,902
But if my question sounded like this--

170
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:42,846
(xylophone music)

171
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,417
Could I sing that?

172
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,019
Probably.

173
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,737
Did I use some patterns in that

174
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,711
like a good musician?

175
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,125
I did.

176
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,865
♫ Valentines, valentines

177
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,303
♫ Pink, red and blue ♫

178
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:58,603
Okay?

179
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:02,039
Try it.

180
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,175
You don't have to do the same thing I did,

181
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,682
but let's do some
repeated notes, let's use

182
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:10,305
some patterns and let's
not be all up and down

183
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:11,629
our instrument.

184
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:14,485
Ready, set and here you go.

185
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:20,197
(xylophone music)

186
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,218
Not bad.

187
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,656
Let's try the answer, boys and girls.

188
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:23,254
Start at any note you want but end on N.

189
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:31,342
And let's make it memorable and singable.

190
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:32,874
Something you can remember,

191
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:34,569
something you can sing.

192
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:36,868
I made a pretty one just for you.

193
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,306
Ready, set and here you go.

194
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:44,994
(xylophone music)

195
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,595
Not bad, not bad.

196
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,033
Here's what I would like to have happened.

197
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,076
I'm going to ask the question,

198
00:08:52,076 --> 00:08:54,096
Tyler's going to give the answer.

199
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:55,652
I'm going to ask the question,

200
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,161
Amanda's going give an answer.

201
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,090
I'm gonna ask the question,

202
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,228
answer, question, answer, question,

203
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,737
answer, question, answer.

204
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:03,430
And then the next row
we're going to switch.

205
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,823
Paige question, me answer.

206
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,367
Kia question, me answer, you get it?

207
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:08,064
Okay?

208
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,410
- Yay!

209
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,804
- [Teacher] Shh.

210
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:14,263
Paige, would you mind before we begin,

211
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,957
arrowing over to the last slide.

212
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:21,507
I want to show you what I am looking for.

213
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:22,715
Yeah, go for it.

214
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:26,778
When you are doing, yeah keep going.

215
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,891
When you are doing your question,

216
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:31,051
or when you are, keep going.

217
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,558
Sorry, keep going.

218
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,787
That's it, okay!

219
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:37,598
Here's what I'm looking for.

220
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,758
Are you alternating your mallets?

221
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,174
Are you bouncing your mallets?

222
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,892
Are you doing the correct rhythm?

223
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:45,470
Did your question start on doe

224
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,770
if you're the question?

225
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,137
Did your answer end on
doe if you're the answer?

226
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:53,364
Was your melody memorable and singable?

227
00:09:53,364 --> 00:09:54,223
Here we go.

228
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,848
My turn first, so we'll go question answer

229
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:59,309
down the batch feels, and you get it.

230
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:00,186
Todd.

231
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:06,391
(xylophone music)

232
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,158
- I forget the--

233
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:10,023
- I made this pretty one just for you.

234
00:10:10,023 --> 00:11:09,327
(xylophone music)

235
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:12,113
Paige, question is ready, here you go.

236
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:13,181
- Do I start this time?

237
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:14,342
- [Teacher] Yeah, you start this time.

238
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,341
Yeah, you're going to do the question

239
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,017
now I'm giving you the answer.

240
00:11:18,017 --> 00:12:40,131
(xylophone music)

241
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:43,080
Now, question, answer, question, answer.

242
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,960
Let's actually do this.

243
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,816
Question, answer, question, answer.

244
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:50,440
Question, answer.

245
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,880
Ready, Britney?

246
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,643
Josh you get ready to do the answer.

247
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,836
Ready, Britney, here she goes.

248
00:12:56,836 --> 00:13:13,412
(xylophone music)

249
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,689
Oh, you know what Ben, it sounded

250
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,733
like the end was ended on a doe.

251
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,476
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,683
- [Teacher] All right,
you want to try it again?

253
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:19,890
That's why Eli was like--

254
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,910
- Oh.
- [Teacher] Yeah, okay?

255
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:29,525
(xylophone music)

256
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,815
Ready, go.

257
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:37,114
(xylophone music)

258
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:39,024
Good, Sabrina, go.

259
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:40,324
- It's, um--
- [Teacher] Question.

260
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:40,945
- Okay.

261
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:51,234
(xylophone music)

262
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:52,444
Nice job.

263
00:13:52,444 --> 00:13:54,650
Now, some of you didn't get a chance

264
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,090
to do the question or didn't get a chance

265
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,878
to do the answer.

266
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,969
Right?

267
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:01,778
So here's what I'm going to have you do.

268
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:04,541
And we have 30 seconds to do this.

269
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,399
With the person next to you,

270
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,140
one of you do the question, one of you

271
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,228
do the answer, okay?

272
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:15,088
(background chatter)

273
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:31,012
(xylophone music)

274
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:32,958
Let's try it together!

275
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,883
Ready, set and here we go.

276
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:40,292
(xylophone music)

277
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,014
Answer.

278
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:45,453
(xylophone music)

279
00:14:45,453 --> 00:14:46,544
Nice.

280
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:48,680
Here's the beauty of the pentatonic scale,

281
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,795
boys and girls.

282
00:14:49,795 --> 00:14:51,072
No matter if we're doing a million

283
00:14:51,072 --> 00:14:52,628
different things at the same time,

284
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:54,299
if we're all on different bars,

285
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,388
the notes of the pentatonic
scale sound so good

286
00:14:57,388 --> 00:15:00,011
together that you can
could be playing something

287
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:02,188
else and it still sounds musical.
