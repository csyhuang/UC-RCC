1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,300
- Has more light around him and it goes
off into this huge dark hole through the

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,663
trees.

3
00:00:07,663 --> 00:00:11,930
- Why do you think it's more light around
him?

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,990
- I don't know. Just to show that, to
bring him more into the main point that

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,460
you should see when you look at the
picture.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:25,140
- What is the dark force symbolizing? Why
is it a dark force? Why isn't it, like, a

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,330
bright light? Yeah.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:32,044
- I don't know. It kind of reminds me of
what Jack said. Dante started going

9
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:37,450
through the forest. It kind of reminds me
of his travel of starting to go to the

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:44,576
layers of hell and stuff. Hell's not a
very bright place so it reminds me of

11
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:45,604
that.

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,450
- One thing, the light and religious
paintings. Jesus has a light around his

13
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,410
head so it might symbolize how he's pure
or more religious. But--

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,127
- What'd you say?

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,870
- I said but Dante isn't pure so why would
they highlight someone who wasn't as pure

16
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,504
as like Jesus?

17
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,690
- Okay, so I want to come your statement
in a moment, because Kailyn had something

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,710
to offer. Why do you say he's not pure? Is
there any indication that he's not pure?

19
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,670
- Well it's kind of an inference because
he's man. We all assume that the purity is

20
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:30,080
in God or Jesus or Buddha or whatever.
He's not because he's man and men have

21
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,330
faults. Women have faults. A human being
is just not divine, I guess.

22
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:42,080
- But it says in the text that he gets
angry with people who are not true to

23
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:49,360
their religion and their beliefs
politically and religiously. So he kind of

24
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:57,290
is the most pure one. Not like Godlike but
he is more pure than the rest, I believe.

25
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:01,740
- So do you think that's why Dante went to
hell in the first place? To go see all the

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,120
bad people? Do you think he was going
there to learn a lesson? Or going there to

27
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:16,480
prove that he was right?
- Because remember this is a fictional.

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,807
This is fictional. So can a character...
'cause you're right we infer that man is

29
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,177
sinful. But can

30
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:32,880
a fictional character be perfect? Can be
flawless? Can be sinless? And if so, is

31
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,280
Dante trying to go a different way of
inference. Is he trying to infer that he

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,590
is, from what you've said, that he wants
to find out more of what sins are so he

33
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:51,040
can make himself pure if he's not already.
So can a fictional character be pure?

34
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:59,510
- One of the questions I think was the
three beasts he encounters and what do

35
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:12,652
they represent. I kind of thought that
they represented what he does or what he

36
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:16,971
did and everything. Like a wake up call.
You're going to go see all of these people

37
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:20,710
who have done things similar to that so
you kind of want to change your ways. They

38
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:25,771
were reminding him what he has done and
what he did because he was violent because

39
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:38,380
he was in that guild kind of thing. He was
considered a fraud by the other team I

40
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,858
guess side. So I think it's more of a like
he's going to there to see what happens

41
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:49,502
when you don't be the best you could be, I
guess.

42
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:56,120
- Who judges where you go? Is it the devil
or is it a higher power?

43
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,464
- I thought it was the gods that judged
that.

44
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:03,852
- Are there gods in this story? Do we ever
hear much about the gods?

45
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,385
- We aren't sure about the gods.
- Yeah, really.

46
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:08,330
- Who judges where all these people go?
Cause they're talking about all the famous

47
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,630
people and the places they are but who
decides that?

48
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,700
- We didn't really read the hell part
as opposed to the...

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,410
- Yeah, yeah.

50
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,050
- So maybe in the other books it would
explain.

51
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,360
- Where the gods are.

52
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:27,240
- And you said who judges where they go
and everything? Technically we don't know

53
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,940
what supreme being judges that because all
we know is the devil is on the bottom

54
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,040
eating Brutus, Cassius and Judas. But in
the book, on page 41, lines 8-9, Minos

55
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,460
is the one who discover the crimes and
dictates where they go. So he's kind of

56
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,998
like boss of hell sort of. Forty-one
lines eight and nine.

57
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:53,440
- I have a question. Are their crimes so
bad to the point that they go to hell or

58
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,270
is it just because they made like sins or something? 
Because everybody makes them so would that make

59
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,108
everybody go to hell?
- That's what I find too

60
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:03,870
[Background Chatter]

61
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:14,770
- Meaningful. But in their own perspective
they are different

62
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:22,430
- Individual, yeah. So do you think that
the layers of hell are how bad of the

63
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,300
thing that the person did like how far?
What do you think depends on how far you

64
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,020
go down--
- Like, the pain increases?

65
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,510
- One of my questions are, are the
punishments of different people different

66
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,370
based on who they are or what they do?

67
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,940
- I think it's what they do but through
their actions they can kind of be defined

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,210
as who they are. I think the layers of
hell go down as the pain and suffering

69
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,470
increases related to their crimes

70
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,780
- Couldn't it be like their pain and
suffering for all of eternity is based off

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,870
of all the pain and suffering that they
had caused others in life? For instance,

72
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,570
in Limbo. All these babies that had died
and weren't baptized are now there but

73
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,570
they hadn't really hurt anybody so they're
not being quite as punished as, let's say, Judas

74
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,100
who's in the center of hell having his
head gnawed on.

75
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,890
He caused a lot of pain and suffering
therefore we was given a greater

76
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,170
punishment for what he had done

77
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,127
- So it depends on who they
put it on.

78
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,010
- Yeah.

79
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,960
- So if they just keep it to themselves?
Like, gouging out the eyes. That's not

80
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,200
really hurting anyone else.

81
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,380
- Right. Where's the gouging of the eyes?
Where did you just pull that from? What

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,450
piece did we read where the eyes were
gouged out?

83
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,890
- Oh, I'm sorry I got confused. Oedipus?

84
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,630
- Oedipus.

85
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:58,640
- He punished himself for it in a weird
way. But, do you think that his punishment

86
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,910
would not go as far because he didn't
torture other people?

87
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,950
- Think before you respond. Think about it
because I want you to respond to this.

88
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,610
This is huge. I want you to write your
question down on a piece of paper and then

89
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,080
their responses to it because you have
probably just now created a thesis for an

90
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,240
essay we're going to do for the end of the
year.

91
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,090
- Okay.

92
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,370
- So write down your question. Mainly she
has brought up, just like I heard you guys

93
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,060
doing with these pictures, a different
text. Didn't you bring up the Odyssey with

94
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,470
this?
- Yeah.

95
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,670
- Do you want me to write Oedipus
specifically?

96
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,840
- Yep, write down the gouging of Oedipus'
eyes. Where would Oedipus have ended up in

97
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,810
Dante's Inferno?
- Okay, so pretty much--

98
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,710
- Yep. And I want you guys to answer and
then I'll move on and come back. I love

99
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,540
how you bring in another text. That's one
reason I brought this picture in, so you

100
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,880
guys hit on that. I love that you brought
this up. This is real higher order

101
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,200
thinking because at the end of this year
our essay for you guys for the final is to

102
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,300
bring in the texts that we've read and you
have to develop a theme so right there's a

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,010
good start. Okay, you ready for them to
answer it?

104
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

105
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,590
- The pain that Oedipus caused wasn't
intentional. So I don't really think he'd

106
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,290
be punished as harshly. I do believe that
he'd be punished due to the fact that he

107
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:26,370
did kill his father and I believe a couple
other people during that fight. So, he would

108
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,500
be punished but I don't believe that the
gouging of his eyes would lessen any of

109
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:41,680
the punishment. 'Cause, really, he didn't
knowingly go into the incest and do that

110
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,650
intentionally. So really, he shouldn't be
punished for something that he didn't know

111
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,190
he was doing.
- But he still killed somebody.

112
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,230
- He did kill somebody. And the gouging of
his eyes, I don't think would lessen that.

113
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,770
I think it was more of a pain in life
lesson for him. Although, It did cause him

114
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,970
a lot of pain, I believe the guilt that he
faced caused him greater pain than his

115
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,210
actual gouging of his eyes.

116
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,150
- May I clarify something really quick here?
So you're saying basically, because she

117
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,860
asked where in hell would he be? So f+irst
of all, what level do you think he'd be?

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,130
Gouging eyes or not, where would he be in
hell? Where would Dante run into him?

119
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,500
- He would be with the murderers.

120
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,390
- With the murderers, okay. So you're
saying that he wouldn't be any more in

121
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,460
depth than that simply because of his
gouging.

122
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,350
- No.

123
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,620
- That is just his own--

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,700
- Retribution.

125
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,940
- Yeah.

126
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,650
- He did that to lessen the guilt in his
life--

127
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,440
- In himself.

128
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,230
- 'Cause the guilt was much more painful
than him gouging out his eyes.

129
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,120
- And also, even delivering pain to yourself
can get you in hell with, like, suicides.

130
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,600
- Right.

131
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:01,430
- 'Cause there's the whole ring where like
people kill themselves and they go to

132
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,920
hell. Or they destroy their possessions. I
didn't quite understand it completely but

133
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:17,810
it seemed to say destroying items that they
had, I don't know, maybe a couch or something. If you

134
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,530
destroyed that, you'd go to hell because
they destroyed their own items.

135
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:31,980
- Right, right. In Circle Nine, and that's what important
about this, in Circle Nine, those people that destroyed or 
take from.

136
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:42,280
You know, you have Canna after Cain. Everything is
allegorical. Every part of Circle Nine,

137
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,950
there's an allegory. There's Ptolemy,
there's Cain. Everybody is compared or

138
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,140
made allegorical in there for their sins.
Because of what they did to humanity. Like

139
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,050
Ptolemy murdered people in his--
In his--

140
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:05,760
He was a ruler. He just murdered people.
Mass murders. So, he was put in there as a

141
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,910
comparison to that kind of sin. That
Hitler type of sin. So everybody in that

142
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,610
level, too. Which would be interesting to
see. Talk about some of our other

143
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,710
literature. Talk about The Odyssey a
little more.

144
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,650
- I have one more question about sin. Do
you think, is everyone's definition of

145
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,940
sinning the same?

146
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,650
- Actually, I don't believe so.

147
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,930
[Background Chatter]

148
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,090
- We were just talking how everybody lies
but how are some still in Limbo.

149
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,920
- Goes along with what he said was,
"no, I didn't steal" so you stole and then

150
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,050
you lied.
- Yeah.

151
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,412
- So you double dipped.

152
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:50,030
- So you half and did different things.

153
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,420
- Oh interesting, so what'd you come to?

154
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,630
- We came to they'd go to the serious one.

155
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,300
- Yeah.

156
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,940
- Whichever one's more serious
- Why?

157
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,150
Basically the one thing that impacted
the world more, like in a bad way, is going to take

158
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:12,310
the worse punishment. So if I stole a
penny, or I lied to the king, I'd probably

159
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,020
get punished for lying to the king. That's
what we kind of came up with.

160
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,700
- Yeah.

161
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,340
- So I want to ask you a question. If
you're saying you lied and then you lie

162
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,550
about lying, or you steal and you lie
about lying.

163
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,710
- I don't steal, sorry.

164
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:32,240
- Yeah, they're two crimes and this person
has chosen to commit two crimes. Okay, so

165
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,900
does that play into that?

166
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,000
- Would you suffer twice the punishment
then?

167
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,400
- No, it doesn't bring up any of that in
Dante's. Basically everybody's got the

168
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,100
same punishment.

169
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,890
- But still wouldn't you get like
harsher--

170
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,990
- Well, depending on the circle.

171
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,890
- Yeah, but some people in the circles do
have worse punishments than other people.

172
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,910
- Will you give me an example?

173
00:12:54,090 --> 00:13:02,290
- Well, let's see. Ulysses, and I forget
the other guy's name, they are in the same

174
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,880
flame and I think he said the flame was
burning brighter. I would assume that'd be

175
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,810
a worse punishment than other people if
they're burning --

176
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,900
- If they're burning, yeah.

177
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:20,900
- Some of the less worse... um... lesser punishments. 
It's like magicians get their heads turned

178
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,090
backwards. You could see where you've been
but you wouldn't cry over it. Unless

179
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,340
getting stabbed to death and then healing
and then getting stabbed to death again

180
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,060
- Yeah

181
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,460
- Then your flesh getting eaten off over
and over and over again.

182
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

183
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,620
- I want to ask you guys a question
because we've studied pictures all year

184
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,030
long and there was one when we were
studying Oedipus. And I don't know who in

185
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,780
this group had this one when you were
doing those folders together, but there

186
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:58,305
is, what is her name, Antigone's brother's
name that was dead...

187
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,139
- Polynices.

188
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,022
- Yeah, Polynices.

189
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:02,345
- Was it the one where she was like
leaning over his body?

190
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:03,878
- Yeah, by the rock.
- Yeah.

191
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,510
- Okay, now that you've read The Inferno,
do some of those photos from some of these

192
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:18,160
other stories and poems tie together or
relate or reoccur?

193
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,210
- I can relate. 
- Okay talk to me about that.
- Because it reminds me of Dante being lost in the forest 

194
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,200
in the beginning and then it reminds me of how
Oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn't

195
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,328
see anything and so he didn't know which path
to take. He had to rely on somebody else.

196
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:42,802
He had to rely on Virgil to get him
through what was to come. Then Oedipus, he

197
00:14:42,802 --> 00:14:47,818
had to rely on Antigone to tell him where
to go and trust her with his life

198
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,838
basically.
- Nice. Nice.

199
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:50,952
- That's what I got.

200
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:54,012
- Well as I walk away I want you guys,
'cause I'm going to leave this here. I want

201
00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:57,890
you guys to talk about other literature.
'Cause you said yes, I can relate some. You

202
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,188
just did. I would like for you to relate.
- All right.

203
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:01,000
- Okay.
- Okay.
