1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:04,279
(children chatting over each other)

2
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:23,621
- How do you know?

3
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,788
(children chatting over each other)

4
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,237
How do you think it might be different?
Okay, maybe Ethan goes here (mumbles).

5
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:36,285
Measure yours and let's see.

6
00:00:36,285 --> 00:01:09,452
(children chatting over each other)

7
00:01:11,323 --> 00:01:14,764
And which one do you think
you're going under?

8
00:01:14,764 --> 00:01:18,931
(children chatting over each other)

9
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,123
I don't know.

10
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:28,355
(children chatting over each other)

11
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,139
Okay, all right.

12
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:33,547
(children chatting over each other)

13
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:38,013
Okay, well you all, listen
to him, listen to him.

14
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:40,067
(children chatting over each other)

15
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,734
You all talk about it.

16
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:48,442
(children chatting over each other)

17
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:54,619
You talk to them, I'm gonna walk around.

18
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,370
- It's my turn, EJ.

19
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:55,537
(children chatting over each other)

20
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:02,158
- [Voiceover] Okay,
let him do the writing.

21
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,038
(children chatting over each other)

22
00:03:05,038 --> 00:03:08,525
- Why are you taking them out of that one?

23
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:12,692
(children chatting over each other)

24
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,949
Okay, and what are you
trying to make it do?

25
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:17,782
- Balance.

26
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:18,661
- Okay, balance.

27
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:21,509
Let's see you trying to make it balance.

28
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,678
(children chatting over each other)

29
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:25,511
Okay.

30
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,412
(children chatting over each other)

31
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:31,160
- We need to put it right there.

32
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,377
- Okay.

33
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:36,104
(children chatting over each other)

34
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:38,021
Did you balance it now?

35
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:42,264
Okay, so what do put in that point?

36
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:59,431
(children chatting over each other)

37
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,579
- [Voiceover] I'm going to scoot this just a little it. And then
you write it down, good.

38
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,212
How did you know it was balanced? Good.

39
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:16,379
(children chatting over each other)

40
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:35,320
You said which one was heavier here? Okay, why did you say (mumbles)?

41
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:59,487
(children chatting over each other)

42
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:08,876
Think you can do that one?
How did you know it was balanced?

43
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,126
Is it balanced?

44
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:14,195
What about that?

45
00:05:14,195 --> 00:05:18,362
(children chatting over each other)

46
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,620
At first, which one was balanced? Because why?

47
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,179
(children chatting over each other)

48
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,762
It was heavy, okay.

49
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,387
(children chatting over each other)

50
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:47,888
- Okay, so how many of
those are (mumbles)?
- I think it was one more.

51
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:52,055
(children chatting over each other)

52
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:56,417
Okay, you're put it in. You'll put what in this one?

53
00:05:56,417 --> 00:06:00,584
(children chatting over each other)

54
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:08,297
And the number of crayons you all used.

55
00:06:08,297 --> 00:07:12,464
(children chatting over each other)

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You had another object that was moving?

57
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Look right here. You think their eraser didn't move?

58
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,759
- [Voiceover] What you all gonna test next?

59
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,791
(children chatting over each other)

60
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,291
Did you even measure that one?

61
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:10,334
(children chatting over each other)

62
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
- And I'll come back. Alright, what are you all doing here?

63
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:45,000
(children chatting over each other)

64
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:49,723
- Do you think if you did the scissors,

65
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,068
and Matthew did the scissors, do you think

66
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,044
it would measure the same?

67
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:53,877
- [Voiceover] Let's do it.

68
00:08:53,877 --> 00:08:54,710
- Okay.

69
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,818
Let's do it one at a time.

70
00:08:58,691 --> 00:08:59,875
What's happening?

71
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,958
You guys can't measure, try this one.

72
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:05,772
Here's my question.

73
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,684
If Matthew blows the paper clip,

74
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:10,557
is it gonna get the same distance as if

75
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:12,308
you blow the paper clip?

76
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,397
What do you think?

77
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:14,230
You don't think so?

78
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,140
Why not?

79
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,307
(children chatting over each other)

80
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:27,696
Matthew, you blow.

81
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:31,863
(children chatting over each other)

82
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:45,251
Okay, all right, so remember that, okay?

83
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,660
Now, Weslee, I want you to test it.

84
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,164
You said you thought
it would go different.

85
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,828
See if you can make a difference.

86
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:54,308
(children chatting over each other)

87
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:57,808
- Yeah, why did it do something different?

88
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,011
What's that that you're blowing out?

89
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:03,844
- Air.

90
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,135
- Air, and what is it?

91
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:05,968
- Gas.

92
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:06,801
- Gas, good.

93
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:08,162
All right, you all can go ahead and finish measuring.

94
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:29,329
(children chatting over each other)

95
00:10:32,836 --> 00:10:35,612
I saw Ella trying. Now, if you and Ella both try to blow

96
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:38,077
on that do you think it's going to move?

97
00:10:38,077 --> 00:10:39,956
Why don't you think it's going to move?

98
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:44,123
(children chatting over each other)

99
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:48,281
You think it's too heavy?

100
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,681
And you don't have enough breath.

101
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:53,370
(children chatting over each other)

102
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,203
Try it and see.

103
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:55,919
See if you all both do it
if you can get it to move.

104
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,618
(children chatting over each other)

105
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:02,701
You're going red in the
face and it's going away.

106
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,984
Did you all think it was going to move?
You all didn't think it was.

107
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:29,151
(children chatting over each other)

108
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,706
How did you find this?

109
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,873
What'd you do?
- Counted.

110
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:40,498
Okay, counted, and what are
you working on right now?

111
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,938
(children chatting over each other)

112
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:42,855
The colors.

113
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,354
(children chatting over each other)

114
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,859
Okay, which one do you have
to count now (mumbles)?

115
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:00,066
Which one do you have there?

116
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,770
(children chatting over each other)

117
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,442
This one, and what is that one?

118
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:06,370
What is that one?

119
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,530
A solid, a liquid, or the gas?

120
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,363
- Solid.

121
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:10,050
- A solid, how are you going to find out?

122
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,574
What are you gonna do?

123
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:12,506
- Look at this.

124
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,906
- You're going to look at
those, can you count those?

125
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,098
I'm gonna come back and see if you counted

126
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:17,994
and made your graph, okay?

127
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:19,221
You're doing good.

128
00:12:19,221 --> 00:12:20,054
Okay.

129
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,790
Okay, can you come over here and count?

130
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,958
You might have to get out of your chair,

131
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,534
you have lots of them.

132
00:12:27,534 --> 00:13:00,701
(children chatting over each other)

133
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:04,057
- [Voiceover] One, two, three, four,

134
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:06,057
five, six, seven, eight.

135
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,313
Eight.

136
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:32,480
(children chatting over each other)

137
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
- Five, six, seven, eight.

138
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:51,668
- Check your numbers, and
you checked to make sure.

139
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,084
All right, whatcha going to do now?

140
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:54,100
- Tally.

141
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,501
- Tally them, okay,
think you all can do that?

142
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:59,268
Okay, you need help
putting it on (mumbles),

143
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:02,644
remember which one is the total (mumbles).

144
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:26,811
(children chatting over each other)

145
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:30,790
How did you know that so quick?

146
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,256
I heard you started counting
and then what did you do?

147
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:34,515
You found it quickly.

148
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:38,682
(children chatting over each other)

149
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,138
You remembered from that, okay.

150
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:45,754
How else could have known that fast?
- Go down there.

151
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,450
Go down there, okay, good.

152
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:59,617
(children chatting over each other)
