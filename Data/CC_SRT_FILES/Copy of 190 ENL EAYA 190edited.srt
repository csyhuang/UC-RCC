1
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:02,247
- Okay, what's in here?

2
00:00:02,247 --> 00:00:03,930
(foreign language) do me a favor.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,566
Go up, and tell me what I'm gonna need.

4
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:07,496
Put (hums).

5
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:11,746
(background chatter)

6
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,027
- I put down the...

7
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,014
- If he's right,
say (speaks foreign language).

8
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,168
- (foreign language)

9
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:17,827
- Okay boys and girls,

10
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:20,143
because it is raining,

11
00:00:21,373 --> 00:00:23,370
I need my one, two, three--

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,529
- [Children] Umbrella.

13
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,664
- What happened to that thing? I like red.

14
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:38,030
Matches my jacket. Maybe,
because it's raining.

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,164
(background chatter)

16
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:48,672
This...

17
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:52,420
This protects me from the rain.
So, because it is raining,

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,884
I need a one, two, three--

19
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:55,449
- [Children] Umbrella.

20
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,785
- Umbrella.

21
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,364
- [Children] Umbrella.

22
00:00:58,364 --> 00:00:59,838
- I might put that here.
Maybe I'll need it.

23
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,662
Okay, maybe I'll need it later.

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:05,729
Okay boys and girls, so let's keep going.

25
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,530
Boys and girls, since it is (hums),

26
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,216
I'll need my (hums).

27
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:17,115
You wanna try it? Come up. Come up.

28
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,733
I don't know, I don't know.

29
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:24,979
(background chatter)

30
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,856
- Oh so now, ooh...

31
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:29,055
(children laughing)

32
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:32,155
- Okay, so nice job.

33
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:34,674
Because it is one, two, three--

34
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:36,009
- [Children] Snowing.

35
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:37,472
- I'll need my--

36
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,074
- [Children] Gloves.

37
00:01:39,074 --> 00:01:41,895
- What type of gloves?
I have these gloves.

38
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:47,607
(children laughing)

39
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,562
- Are these gloves the
type of gloves I need?

40
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:51,129
- [Children] No.

41
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,847
- Are these gloves the
type of gloves I need?

42
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,041
- [Children] Yes.
- [Children] No.

43
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,663
- I think, I don't think these will work.

44
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:01,066
These gloves. Say it with me: gloves.

45
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,587
- [Children] Gloves.

46
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:05,443
- Now just people in pink. Gloves.

47
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:06,719
- [Children] Gloves.

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,494
- (laughs) Oh, there's a
lot of people wearing pink.

49
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,758
Okay, just boys.

50
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,058
- [Boys] Gloves.

51
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:14,115
- Just girls.

52
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:15,217
- [Girls] Gloves.

53
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:16,889

55
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:20,175
- Just people from South America.

56
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,219
- [Children] Gloves.

57
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,891
- All right. There we go. There we go.

58
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:25,689
All right, let's keep moving, okay?

59
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:30,658
Boys and girls, it is (hums),
so I'll need my (hums).

60
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:34,297
We're right here. What is
this? What's going on here?

61
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,862
- [Children] Windy.

62
00:02:36,862 --> 00:02:38,778
- So windy. So windy. What do I need?

63
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:40,403
Tina, come on up. Come on up.

64
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,157
I don't know, maybe I'll use this.

65
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:45,256
(children laughing)

66
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:51,177
(boy speaks in foreign language)

67
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:53,394
(children laughing)

68
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:58,096
- Okay, so Tina, Tina. One,
two, three guys. Because it is--

69
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,941
- [Children] Windy.

70
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:01,253
- Okay, in Chinese it's--

71
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:02,855
- [Children] (speaking foreign language)

72
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:04,771
- Okay, I'll need my--

73
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,292
- [Children] Jacket.

74
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:14,359
(background chatter)

75
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,856
- All right, all right.
Great, great, great, great.

76
00:03:16,856 --> 00:03:21,395
So guys, I just wanna say one thing.

77
00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:24,936
I wanna say that these words I'm using

78
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:27,199
are cause and effect words.

79
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,171
And we have some examples of clothing here

80
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:34,351
that you're gonna need, and I want you

81
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:37,450
to focus for a second with this.

82
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,074
Say it with me: since.
- [Children] Since.

83
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:41,873
- Because.
- [Children] Because.

84
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:44,438
- So.
- [Children] So.

85
00:03:44,438 --> 00:03:47,114
- Boys and girls, these are
words you use when speaking,

86
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:51,626
when you're talking about
cause and effect when speaking.

87
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:55,680
Because it's snowing,
I need my heavy jacket.

88
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,256
That's cause and effect.

89
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:01,334
These are words we use with speaking.

90
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:03,296
These words, let's say them just one time

91
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:05,409
for a little pronunciation practice.

92
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,150
Thus.
- [Children] Thus.

93
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,170
- Therefore.
- [Children] Therefore.

94
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,734
- Consequence. Three
syllables: Con-se-quence.

95
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:14,255
- [Children] Consequence.

96
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,275
- All right, good, good. And the fact is.

97
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:17,993
- [Children] And the fact is.

98
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:19,774
- These are pretty much words

99
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,736
we're gonna use in writing only.

100
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:25,195
We don't really speak these
words, not often, very rare.

101
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:28,736
These we used in speaking:
since, because, and so.

102
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,407
And these are the words
you're gonna be using today.

103
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:34,355
You're gonna be using them to
write some simple sentences

104
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:37,966
that show cause and effect relationships.

105
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,275
These are more when
you're writing an essay,

106
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,168
an essay, like maybe for the ELA,

107
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,606
or when you're writing an academic essay.

108
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:48,170
Okay, so we have one more.
You guys are doing so great.

109
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,525
And I have a lot of stuff here.
I have a one, two, three--

110
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,092
- [Children] Scarf.

111
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,170
- Say it with me: scarf.

112
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,624
- [Children] Scarf.

113
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:00,643
- What about that "F" on the end? Scarf.

114
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:01,990
- [Children] Scarf.

115
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,392
- Scarf.
- [Children] Scarf.

116
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:08,158
- Okay, I like this
scarf. It's a nice scarf.

117
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:10,492
I have a, what is this?

118
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:12,129
- [Boy] Sweater.

119
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:13,533
- Sweater or sweatshirt?

120
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:14,845
- [Children] Sweatshirt.

121
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:18,171
- No, sweater. Sweater.

122
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:19,598
- [Children] Sweater.

123
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:23,846
- Okay, I think when it's,
what is this outside?

124
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,159
- [Children] Sunny.

125
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,482
- Say it with me: sunny.

126
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,246
- [Children] Sunny.

127
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:34,121
- It is sunny, so...

128
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,640
I think, you know what's interesting is,

129
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,043
this is the important word: so.

130
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:41,446
- [Children] So.

131
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:47,181
- So I'll need...

132
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:53,462
- [Children] Sunglasses.

133
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:56,759
- Boys and girls, when it gets
really, really sunny outside,

134
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,867
sometimes the sun hurts my
eyes, so I put on my sunglasses.

135
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:07,258
Okay, so...

136
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:10,973
I want you to try it now.
I want you to try it.

137
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:19,320
(background chatter)

138
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,116
Boys and girls, now you
all have in front of you

139
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,314
two worksheets. You have one worksheet

140
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,218
in front of you, you
have two different ones.

141
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:33,093
Many of you have this worksheet,

142
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,437
and many of you have this worksheet, okay?

143
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:50,472
I just gonna do one quick sentence here.

144
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:53,925
Because it is hot,

145
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:59,179
I'll need my--

146
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:01,512
- [Children] Sunglasses. Shirt.

147
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:04,252
- Someone raise their hand.

148
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:07,072
Tina. Tina, say that loud.

149
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:10,602
- [Child] Sunglasses.

150
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:13,405
- Sunglasses.
- [Children] Sunglasses.

151
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:17,220
- And, shorts.

152
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,124
Oh, I didn't tell you about my shorts.

153
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:25,753
I brought those today too.

154
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:27,203
Say it with me: shorts.

155
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,678
- [Children] Shorts.

156
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:30,396
- Say it with me: shorts.

157
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,697
- [Children] Shorts.

158
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:34,703
- Okay, so it's sunny
and I'm gonna need my

159
00:07:34,703 --> 00:07:37,455
shorts and sunglasses. I got 'em.

160
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:39,196
I'll need my sunglasses and shorts.

161
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:43,259
And "because" here, this is
what you call a transition word.

162
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,579
This is what we're working on.

163
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:54,625
Now, if I have this here, Juan Pablo
you have this worksheet.

164
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,613
We have cause and effect.

165
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:59,298
If I have this here, we have, let's say,

166
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:06,771
since it is raining,

167
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:12,476
I'll need my raincoat.

168
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,639
And that's a coat for rain.
It's on your list there.

169
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,675
So, what is this word here?
Say it with me: since.

170
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:20,196
- [Children] Since.

171
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,883
- "Since" is a transition word.

172
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:24,657
In speaking, and then sometimes writing

173
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:27,861
like this style of writing,
you would use these words.

174
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,856
All the time in speaking,
you show cause and effect.

175
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,157
Since I don't have any money,

176
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:34,235
I can't buy anything to eat tonight.

177
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,595
Because it's raining, I
think I'll go to the movies.

178
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:39,236
Cause and effect, boys and girls.

179
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:41,595
Use it each and every
time you think about,

180
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,711
speak about cause and effect.

181
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,933
Now I want you to try
this with your partner,

182
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,387
and then we're gonna
practice speaking these out.

183
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:53,651
On three, I want you to
go. Three, two, one, go.

184
00:08:53,651 --> 00:09:02,635
(background chatter)

185
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:05,852
Use the examples, use the sentences.

186
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:10,333
And here's some more
additional examples for you.

187
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,948
(background chatter)

188
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:21,832
Do you see it up top?
Clothing. Right here.

189
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:25,366
Clothing. How would you
make "clothes" out of that?

190
00:10:25,366 --> 00:10:32,204
Can you see it? Give it a try.

191
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,695
Can you read this to me?

192
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:36,943
(inaudible)

193
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:39,210
What do you need when it's hot?

194
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,045
(inaudible)

195
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:45,115
Okay, so you see the list right here?

196
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:49,641
Which items are for hot?
Which items are for cold?

197
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:58,126
Can you try to write that for me?

198
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,820
I'm gonna come back.

199
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:13,981
(background chatter)

200
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,650
- Look at the charts,

201
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,802
they are there to help you.

202
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:24,119
(background chatter)

203
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:27,637
You see the chart that I made?

204
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:31,700
So, let's try something.
I want to try something.

205
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,153
Can you read me, actually
read Hon Lu your first sentence.

206
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,962
And you read her your
first sentence. You first.

207
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:42,176
Partner A, partner B. Partner A, go.

208
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,521
You first, you're partner A.

209
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:52,986
- Because it is raining, I
need my umbrella and raincoat.

210
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:56,566
- Because it's hot, I need my shorts.

211
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,459
- Okay, now you're speaking
to each other, not to me.

212
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,104
Okay, keep going. Go.

213
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:08,942
- Since it is sunny, I need my sunglasses.

214
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:14,700
(background conversation
drowns out speaker)

215
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,072
- Can you write that there?

216
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,973
Look right here. That list, for you.

217
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:25,323
Okay, you see on the...

218
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:42,785
(background chatter)

219
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:49,925
(boy speaking in foreign language)

220
00:12:49,925 --> 00:13:20,818
(background chatter)

221
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:24,377
- Look at the
word. Slide through it.

222
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,228
Two syllables.

223
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:33,235
(background chatter)

224
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:37,474
Is that one boot? One boot? Or two?

225
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:41,125
So how, is there...

226
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:47,619
Yes, yes. Boots. Great.

227
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:51,996
This is great stuff. I'm proud of you.

228
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:55,943
So proud of you.

229
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,398
Read this.

230
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,719
You look like you
haven't got started here.

231
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:03,203
So listen to him, he did
a really nice job here.

232
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:05,444
And let's work together, okay?

233
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,165
Can you read me your first sentence?

234
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:18,373
- [Boy] Because it's hot,

235
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,683
so I need

236
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:25,453
my sunglasses.

237
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:28,788
- Good, now pause. Now
listen, I want you to try one.

238
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:39,828
(background conversation
drowns out speaker)

239
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:44,529
- So I need my (speaks foreign language).

240
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,780
- I'm sorry, did you say the--
- [Boy] Umbrella.

241
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,279
- If it's hot, I need an umbrella?

242
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,556
- No.

243
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:53,028
- If it's, which one?

244
00:14:53,028 --> 00:14:55,349
Which one?

245
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,864
If I, if it...

246
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:59,228
Which one do I need an umbrella?
