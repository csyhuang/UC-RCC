1
00:00:00,926 --> 00:00:04,444
- What do you think it
is going to be this time?

2
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:08,277
I think it's going to
be like negative 57, 59.

3
00:00:10,168 --> 00:00:12,585
- Maybe like 54 or something.

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,677
- Colder or hotter.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You don't need to touch...

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,602
- You don't need to touch it.

7
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,685
You and your temperature.

8
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,937
(multiple voices talking at once)

9
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:49,786
- [Voiceover] I got a (mumbles) playing

10
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:53,560
with your (mumbles).

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,953
- Go down.

12
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,867
- [Voiceover] The temperature
is going to go down with the ice.

13
00:00:57,867 --> 00:00:59,132
- It was 22.

14
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:01,466
- [Voiceover] 22, no not 22.

15
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:02,975
- [Voiceover] You think
(mumbles) ice the temperature is

16
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,775
going to go down?

17
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,942
(multiple voices talking at once)

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
- The water went up.

19
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:27,066
- It's your choice how much
of anything you put in.

20
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:29,690
(multiple voices talking at once)

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,012
- Should we put a lot?

22
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:36,179
- A little more.
- A little more.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,781
- Why don't you dump it into (mumbles)?

24
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:46,683
- Not the whole thing.

25
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:47,516
- Yeah.

26
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:51,556
Oh!

27
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:57,788
(multiple voices talking at once)

28
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:07,156
- [Voiceover] Don't put
it all in like that. There's hardly any room.

29
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:07,989
- Ready?

30
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,157
- Go.

31
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:44,326
(multiple voices talking at once)

32
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:49,475
- Science is kind of messy, isn't it?

33
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:50,543
It's okay.

34
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:54,595
Just put it back in
there and work together.

35
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,280
- Tell me when to go.

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,430
- Ready?

37
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,930
- Ready and start.

38
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:06,288
- What do you think?

39
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:10,205
I think it's going to be
like maybe 20 degrees.

40
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,928
- Or maybe negative 10.

41
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,162
- We'll just have to see.

42
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:22,329
(multiple voices talking at once)

43
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,924
- 40, Jacob, 40.

44
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:33,843
- [Voiceover] No, it's 50. 40.

45
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,092
- 50 degrees, it's almost.

46
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,545
- It's 50 degrees, Jake.

47
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:46,886
It's 50 degrees.

48
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:50,018
It's 50 degrees, Jake.

49
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,766
What's he doing.

50
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,499
- [Voiceover] So where's the line?
Try to put one in.

51
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:09,818
- Oh, so now you get it?

52
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,182
- Where's the line?

53
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:15,794
- [Voiceover] And it's 40.

54
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,794
- 40, comes out like 44.

55
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:21,762
- [Voiceover] What's the temperature?

56
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,046
- It changed.

57
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:24,467
- 44. It says 40.

58
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,300
- [Voiceover] No, it's 44.

59
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,550
- Jacob, it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,519
- [Voiceover] What are you
having a dispute about here.

61
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,749
(mumbles) get out now.

62
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:34,416
- It was right here.

63
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:37,080
- So it's on.

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,357
- It's not even gone down.

65
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:41,129
- And now it went up to what?

66
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,625
Well, a little higher than that.

67
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,074
Yours went up, so what did,

68
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,246
how do you know, Jacob, by looking at the

69
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,032
thermometer, how it went up or down?

70
00:04:51,032 --> 00:04:52,199
Explain to me.

71
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:55,850
- I know how it went up because I see,

72
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,205
because if you turn your
head away and then you look

73
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:00,705
at it, it went up.

74
00:05:01,992 --> 00:05:03,791
- You think so?

75
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,485
How do you read this, though?

76
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:10,652
(multiple voices talking at once)

77
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:17,178
- Are they?

78
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,664
There's five lines right, let's see,

79
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,881
but how do you break it
up so you can read it

80
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:22,631
to get from 70 to 80?

81
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:25,595
How do you break that
up, Jacob, do you know?

82
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:26,428
- Um.

83
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:29,240
- Right, you count by twos.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,634
Okay, you guys get busy, I'm interrupting

85
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:34,551
your experimental time,
you're scientists here.

86
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:40,062
(multiple voices talking at once)

87
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:44,107
- [Voiceover] Down, all the way down.

88
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:49,870
- [Voiceover] Just color it up to 50.

89
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,264
- [Voiceover] Down 30.

90
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,264
I wonder what was in it.

91
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:56,286
- I think it's salt.

92
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:00,467
- I don't think it's salt.

93
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:03,717
- Last time I used, last time I used it

94
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,967
it went down, and then
it went down even more.

95
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:28,134
(multiple voices talking at once)

96
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:32,348
- That's what I told you.

97
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:33,681
- It's floating.

98
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,315
- I'm breathing in good water.

99
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,091
Water.

100
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,823
- What happened?

101
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:52,990
(multiple voices talking at once)

102
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,374
- Use the thermometer.

103
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,670
Ready, set, go.

104
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,058
(mumbles) one more.

105
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:09,914
(multiple voices talking at once)

106
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:14,081
- I think it's going to
get colder, and (mumbles).

107
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:17,855
I think it's going to get (mumbles).

108
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,176
- I think it's going to get negative 10.

109
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,848
- What do you think, Emily?

110
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:24,856
- [Voiceover] Zero degrees.

111
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:29,280
(multiple voices talking at once)

112
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,113
- [Voiceover] Maybe negative zero.
- I'm not sure there is a negative zero.

113
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:39,473
- It's like frost all over it.

114
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,306
- Cold.

115
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:44,013
- Frost right here.

116
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,577
- Whatever was in it makes it go down.

117
00:07:47,577 --> 00:07:51,188
- Temperature go down, makes frost.

118
00:07:51,188 --> 00:08:15,355
(multiple voices talking at once)

119
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,982
- Mystery (mumbles) is salt.

120
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,149
The mystery grain is salt.

121
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:26,412
The mystery grain is salt,
it's melting the ice.

122
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:30,579
- [Voiceover] And it's
condensing on the outside.

123
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,577
- [Voiceover] Ready guys?

124
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,001
- [Voiceover] Five, four.

125
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:38,626
- [Voiceover] What do
you guys think it is?

126
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,842
What do you think the
temperature's going to be

127
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:42,748
this time?

128
00:08:42,748 --> 00:08:43,978
- I don't know.

129
00:08:43,978 --> 00:08:44,811
55.

130
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,068
- Lower than 50.

131
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,235
- 555 degrees?

132
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,130
- That would be toasty.

133
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:55,159
Got to be lower.

134
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,817
- [Voiceover] One, two, three, four, five.

135
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,604
I see that most of you have
finished your experiment.

136
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:02,775
I would like to call and see.

137
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,899
I'm going to get some questions.

138
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:07,964
- Take it out.

139
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,916
- Okay, eight.

140
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,810
I have questions.

141
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,703
Teagan, your group needs
to come to me, please.

142
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:13,166
Thank you, very good.

143
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,999
Jacob, what did you notice between

144
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,226
the base temperature
and the first time when

145
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,782
you put the water in, what happened?

146
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:24,938
- I noticed that when
the base temperature,

147
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:28,456
when we put in the base
temperature, it was only

148
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,706
71 degrees, and then when we put in the

149
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:39,007
water, it only changed by one degree.

150
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:43,828
- [Voiceover] It only
changed by one degree.

151
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,302
Very good.

152
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:48,204
Number nine, who's number nine?

153
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:49,287
Kayla, Kayla.

154
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:54,699
What did you guys notice
about the temperature?

155
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:56,375
- We...

156
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,497
- [Voiceover] What happened to it,

157
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:01,417
what happened to the temperature?

158
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,322
- It went down.

159
00:10:02,322 --> 00:10:03,623
- [Voiceover] It went down.

160
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,294
What happened to your can, who knows?

161
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:07,756
Think about that, take a
minute with your group,

162
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,799
I want you to talk about what's happening

163
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,549
to your can, and why.

164
00:10:12,765 --> 00:10:16,932
(multiple voices talking at once)

165
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:30,587
- [Voiceover] So maybe it
got frost for (mumbles).

166
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:32,804
- They get more frost on it.

167
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:35,304
When I put, and it got yellow.

168
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,921
The water was clear and
then it got yellow

169
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,918
when we put salt in.

170
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:42,889
- [Voiceover] It got dirty.

171
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,972
_ [Voiceover] It looks like lemonade.

172
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,492
- It's all mushy.

173
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:53,579
- The (mumbles) stuff is
looking to the ice that--

174
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,495
- And making it squishy.

175
00:10:55,495 --> 00:10:58,641
- [Voiceover] Okay, one,
two, three, four, five,

176
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:00,116
come back to me for a minute.

177
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,172
I pulled number five.

178
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:05,061
Number five, what is
happening to your can?

179
00:11:05,061 --> 00:11:06,489
- It's getting frost on it.

180
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:07,685
- [Voiceover] It's getting frost on it.

181
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:09,415
Why do you think it's getting frost?

182
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,621
What did your group think that it

183
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,003
was getting frost on it from?

184
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:15,348
- The ice and the mystery ingredient.

185
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:16,892
- [Voiceover] The mystery ingredient and

186
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:19,481
the ice are making the can frosty.

187
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,012
What did we learn about, with the weather

188
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:26,099
cycle, we talked about that,
what's really happening?

189
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:29,245
Talk in your group, is it the

190
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:33,216
can making the water come
on in and make the frost?

191
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:35,096
Talk in your group and
figure out if you guys

192
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,767
know what's coming that's
making the stuff on the

193
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,903
outside of the can.

194
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,070
(multiple voices talking at once)

195
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:51,446
- There is water on the side of the can.

196
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:04,533
- Maybe the mystery thing...

197
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:10,254
- [Voiceover] Making
condensation on the can?

198
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:12,216
And because I learned a lot about that--

199
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:16,651
- I think the mystery one
and the ice did it together.

200
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:17,742
- That could be.

201
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:19,575
- Yeah, that could be.

202
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,906
- And combined and then
it created frost on the

203
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,833
outside of the can.

204
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,851
- [Voiceover] I think that
the water, the mystery

205
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,291
ingredient, (mumbles).

206
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:34,565
- [Voiceover] Okay, one,
two, three, four, five.

207
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:38,732
Number three, what is making
your can get the frost

208
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:43,407
or the wet stuff, what's
that wet stuff called?

209
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,240
Ella.

210
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,073
- Condensation.

211
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,381
- [Voiceover] It's called condensation.

212
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:48,162
What do you, why is that
happening to your can?

213
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,807
Number three, that's you right Luke?

214
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:51,376
Okay, what's happening?

215
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:54,063
- Because it's like evaporating, and when

216
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:57,082
it touches the cold can,
then it turns back into

217
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,606
cold water.

218
00:12:58,606 --> 00:12:59,844
- [Voiceover] What's evaporating?

219
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,700
Stop, don't answer that.

220
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,926
Think in your group, what,
he said it's evaporating,

221
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:07,828
and then it's touching the can.

222
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,092
What's touching the
can? Talk in your group,

223
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:11,661
figure out if you can
figure out what's coming to

224
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:12,911
touch your can.

225
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,574
- So well really it (mumbles) can.

226
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:22,324
- Yeah, it's kind of
melting, so the water is

227
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:24,705
on the can...

228
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,858
- So it's the mushy, icky...

229
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,737
- I know whatever mystery stuff.

230
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:38,431
- [Voiceover] Now I'll take it.

231
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,406
It makes me, and then it
makes water, water, water.

232
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,656
Everything, you know, water.

233
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:52,546
- [Voiceover] How will
Eve's last question?

234
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,732
- [Voiceover] Nope, we're
just asking questions

235
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,565
right this second.

236
00:13:58,565 --> 00:14:02,471
You guys need to wait,
then we're gonna (mumbles).

237
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:05,278
One, two, three, four, five, come back

238
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:06,546
to me.

239
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,116
Number 19, who's 19?

240
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:09,640
- Ella.

241
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,576
- [Voiceover] Okay, Ella.

242
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:14,743
What is happening to make
that can wet on the outside?

243
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:20,583
- The water and the
ice, well the water tries

244
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,084
to evaporate, but since
there's ice at the top, it hits

245
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:26,544
the ice, and then it comes back down.

246
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,491
But then it gets on the can.

247
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:29,865
- [Voiceover] So the
water, you think the water,

248
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:33,185
in the, the can itself
is coming and making that

249
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:37,472
water come back on and
catch that, hit the ice.

250
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:39,117
Good thought, let's
keep going, let's see if

251
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:40,988
we can get some more.

252
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,679
Who is number 12?

253
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,512
- [Voiceover] Hayden.

254
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:45,713
- [Voiceover] Hayden's
not here, so let's move on

255
00:14:45,713 --> 00:14:48,399
and let's find number nine.

256
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,335
Who's number nine?

257
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:50,331
- Kayla.

258
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:51,164
- Kayla.

259
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,855
Kayla, what's happening to your can,

260
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,542
what's happening to it and why?

261
00:14:58,542 --> 00:14:59,709
- It frosting.

262
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,913
- [Voiceover] It's frosting.
