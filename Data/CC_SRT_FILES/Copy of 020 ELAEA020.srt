1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,860
- Can you think of... what-what images
are coming into your head about the

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,690
Holocaust that relate to this?

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,850
- Um, people dying in the gas chambers

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,200
- Okay, and... and how did that happen?

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,570
- He convinced other people that they were
awful, and then that's really the only way

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,860
you can get people to do something as
cruel as that.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,200
- Okay, so you're saying Hitler couldn't
have carried out all that evil himself so

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,280
he had to convince other people that
basically the Jewish people were what?

9
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,210
- Nothing

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,640
- They were just less than... just a
lesser race of people

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,513
- You're on a good track, I'll check back
with you in a second.

12
00:00:42,513 --> 00:00:44,088
[chatter]

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,470
- ... by stepping on another group of
people.

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:57,020
- So the other groups would actually help
them.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,990
- Like we have to remember that the
injustice... the injustice is what causes

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,030
us to want to go and help and restore
justice and it's not just injustice

17
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,490
anyway.

18
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,420
- you have to want to help and not just
sit back and do nothing.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:24,040
- Well outside people like in Atlanta and
Birmingham, like, in there, like, in

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,960
Birmingham were being persecuted while
people in Atlanta weren't really doing

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,400
anything.

22
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,500
- Well I mean, look what's happening
today, I mean, we have a volunteer army

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,150
and people are volunteering and going and
trying to stop the injustice in

24
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,490
Afghanistan and so that was practically
the same thing as what Martin Luther King

25
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,960
did for Alabama.

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:49,590
- So you're saying you see a connection in
the real world news? That sort of our

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,796
soldiers, the fact that they volunteer
would be an example for number five? Is

28
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:57,805
that what you are saying?
- Yeah

29
00:01:57,805 --> 00:01:59,450
- Had y'all talked about number five yet?

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,910
- Uh, we were just going in order and
seeing which ones that we could...

31
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,890
- And yours is...
read me your quotation.

32
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,590
- Um, "Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere."

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,430
- Okay good. Well you're just being to
come up with things. Okay go ahead I'm

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,630
just going to...

35
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,960
- Okay, so what's the first question?

36
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,490
- Explain the context in which, um, Martin
Luther King said this and how it applies

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,480
in that situation.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,450
- Okay

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,940
- He doesn't want people to sit back and
not do anything about a problem, he wants

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,480
them to go and help and stop...

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,430
- It's almost as if their problem is his
problem-

42
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,560
- Is his problem.

43
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,330
- Good, I like that.

44
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,920
- But even though he wants them to help,
well he doesn't want them to do it in a

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,570
violent way.

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,010
- Always need to underguard MLK with
that, don't we?

47
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,700
- And that sort of ties into "It's wrong
to use immoral means to attain moral

48
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,100
ends."

49
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,000
- Do you find yourself, as you're
discussing any one of these, the others

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,860
layer on there?

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,620
- Yeah

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,190
- That's why it feels so important to have
gotten this whole document as a whole.

53
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,740
Think
you've gotten enough from them, Brianna,

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,500
for that one?

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,030
- Yeah, I think so.

56
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,990
- Well I guess Clyde's already said that,
there's already one for the current news--

57
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:19,410
- Yeah

58
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,070
- ... that we could put down.

59
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,620
- So the volunteer soldiers.

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,650
- Volunteer army.

61
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,490
- Volunteer army.

62
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,691
- I'll check back with y'all, good job.

63
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,400
- ... are they more reluctant to, like,
um, listen to the lower class bunnies

64
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,780
cause they felt like they had a better
rule of it.

65
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,710
- Yeah I think that's it.

66
00:03:45,890 --> 00:04:06,510
- Okay, so in Watership Down, the higher
class rabbits did not want to give up

67
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,750
their superior... how do you spell that
because I think I spelled that before...

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,100
privileges

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,150
- Privileges? You know what, to be honest
with you every time I am typing, I let

70
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,250
spell-check do it because that d and g
always messes me up

71
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,230
- I was spelling superiority.

72
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,680
- Superiority, I'm sorry. Okay, so what
group have you chosen Colleen? and what...

73
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,400
what... ?

74
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,850
- Uh, privileged groups seldom give up
their privileges voluntarily and groups

75
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,850
tend to be more immoral than individuals.

76
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,920
- And I hear that you're using a Watership
Down example, which-

77
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,800
- My idea.

78
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,140
- Your idea, good for you! And what is
the, um, what Warren are we talking about?

79
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,150
- The very first one, um.

80
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,320
- Sandleform.
- Sandleform, yeah.

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,760
- Yeah, go ahead and tell me about that.

82
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,590
- Yeah, it's like, um, the higher class
rabbits didn't want to give up their

83
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,980
privileges of superiority to listen to the
lower bunnies.

84
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,910
[cross talk]

85
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,080
- Does that make sense to you, India?
That's a good example, I really like it!

86
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,640
Okay, have you gotten anything else?

87
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,190
- Um, we did the one about the time in
history where this quotation applies?

88
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,046
- What was the time in history, Bish?

89
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,650
- Um...

90
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,200
- Number two.

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,180
- Where this quotation applies is the
Holocaust. Um, during Nazi rule, people

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,970
felt better about discriminating against
the Jews because many others were also

93
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,700
doing it.

94
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,430
- So what was the privileged group
that were reluctant to give up its

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,470
privileges?

96
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,850
- Um, actually I think this one was
grouped to be more of an individuals

97
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,360
rights.

98
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,100
- Right, so the whole group of what?

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,190
- The whole group of, um...

100
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,170
- Nazis.

101
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,020
- ... the Nazis and the pretty much
anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis.

102
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,870
- But maybe they wouldn't have carried out
those atrocities alone but kind of got

103
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,020
into a mob mentality, is that kind of where 
we are with this?

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,230
- Yes.

105
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,320
- Good, well y'all go ahead, I'm just
going to watch a minute

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,790
- So...

107
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,540
- I'll finish writing the Watership Down
one... the higher class rabbits did not

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,370
want to give up their superiority to...
how about... admit that some of the

109
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:15,480
lower

110
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:20,890
- Number four would be easier to connect
to a teenager's life... that one actually

111
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,340
fits for both of those.

112
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,910
- What does?

113
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:35,020
- Um, for telling a time in a teenager's
life, um, both of these, the two parts of

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,900
the quote would apply because it's like,
when you're getting, like, verbally

115
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,940
abused, it feels much worse coming from a
group than it does from an individual. 

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,770
So if there's a whole group picking on
you, then that makes it worse and the

117
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:00,540
privileged groups seldom give up their
privileges voluntarily. So say, say someone

118
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,900
has a good cafeteria lunch table and
someone who's sitting over by the garbage

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
cans wants to move over there, so they ask,
"Hey you don't have to sit over at our

120
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,600
table, but can you move somewhere else so
we can sit there just for a day." They'll

121
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,110
probably say "No" because they won't think
of another place to go besides that table

122
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,320
that those other people left.

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,550
- And they don't want to go by the garbage
cans.

124
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,540
- Nobody wants to.

125
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,310
- I think that's a good connection. A good,
very present day connection. Good, I'll

126
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,000
be back. Yes of course

127
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,060
- Um, Allison, would you like to?

128
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,690
- I have no clue, would it be okay to
write about, like, how people in foreign

129
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,340
countries use, like, the sex trade as an
"it," an I-it relationship?

130
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,540
- Certainly.
- Mr. Gallant's class.

131
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,480
- We just had to make sure it was all
right with you before we started just writing

132
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:56,980
it down.

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,000
- That's okay, that's okay, that seems
very real to me. Okay

134
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,560
- ... fictional things, so if it's
fictional, it doesn't have to be people

135
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,720
- I didn't say that we could use, um,
what's that, Watership Down, I said we

136
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,340
could use that, did I not?

137
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,380
- All right, let's see...

138
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,010
- Okay, whatever.

139
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,500
- I said we can use Hazel and the Warren
for oppressed people that are not...

140
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,380
- But I think we should do Efrafa because
the bunnies, like, revolted and they got

141
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,040
free remember?

142
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,810
- Yeah.

143
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,900
- That's what I'm thinking.

144
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,330
- I'm hearing an argument where both of
you think Watership would be a good

145
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,610
connection but we're debating which what?

146
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,130
- Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed
forever.

147
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,520
- Which Warren would like... be better

148
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,140
- I think Efrafa.

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,820
- Which one did you say?

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,420
- Um, the first one that came to from...
what was it called...

151
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,110
- [together] Sandleford.
- Sandleford.

152
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,870
- Okay, tell me why you think that.

153
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:02,300
- Because they were, they had freedom, but
it was like they were just, they couldn't

154
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
do what they wanted all the time. They
could just do certain things in a certain

155
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,510
vicinity. They couldn't go out or go
anywhere, and they were just stuck against

156
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:20,770
their will for that long of a time until
they, um, like, revolted against their

157
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:21,990
Warren and left.

158
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,440
- What were you going to add, Michael?

159
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,030
- Oh, like it was like a routine everyday,
like, it was the same thing, they followed

160
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,130
like a routine, like they went out and
then ate and then slept

161
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,200
- But I think Efrafa is like that except
for it's a lot worse, like they didn't

162
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,510
even get to go out, like they got like
feeding times and they would have to feed,

163
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,580
like, right here and they'd have to go
right back into their Warren.

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,900
- I think they're both good examples, but
I think Machi's is more able to be

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,940
explained by that because they did, but in
his, you know, uh, uh, Hazel and Big-Wig

166
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,250
and all them broke away and then they went
to go search for...

167
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,440
- They eventually got what they wanted. In
Efrafa they didn't get what they wanted

168
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,130
until someone came in to...

169
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,910
- And not everybody in Efrafa got out.

170
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,300
- But not everyone in, um, Sandleford got
out, most of them didn't.

171
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
- But I mean the group that we're talking
about, the main...

172
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,880
- But the main characters got out and
achieved what they wanted, where they

173
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,740
wanted.
- Because no one else would listen.

174
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,700
- Let me tell you something, the main
reason we're doing this is so that these

175
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,000
quotations and these philosophies and that
kind of thing, will inform our later life.

176
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,100
It doesn't make me sad that you have two
examples because when it's a little bit

177
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,340
wrong, or when it's a lot wrong because
when you notice it when it's a little bit

178
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,970
wrong sometimes you can keep it from
getting a lot wrong, so it kind of pleases

179
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:51,410
me that you're seeing it at two different
levels, so I think use Efrafa and

180
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,644
Sandleford, and you'll have the best answer,
Okay?

181
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,690
Okay, what are we working on?

182
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,950
- We are trying to debate whether we
should pick Cuba or Egypt as current

183
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,640
events for-

184
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,970
- ... for privileged groups so we can
get...

185
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,840
- Well, let's hear your arguments.

186
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,900
- Cuba, Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for
60 years and he's still going strong.

187
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,090
- Metaphorically, he's about to die.

188
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,900
- He's still in power, okay? Egypt's been
resolved already.

189
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,680
- No.

190
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,710
- Well, they're arguing that it's not in
the news but it's going on right now.

191
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:36,140
- Well I think it would be best if we did
something that was going on in the news

192
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,820
that we've like talked about in class that's

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,460
really really really...

194
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
- And we all understand it.

195
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,040
- What don't you understand about Cuba
though?

196
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,160
- Like there's nothing that's really in
the news right now

197
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,180
- Cuba, they still have the same old thing
just like every other country that's

198
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,910
happened, just a little bit worse.

199
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,930
- Here's what I'm hearing. You have a
great example but your group is wanting to

200
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,730
go with the Egypt example, and it doesn't
dis, uh, disvalue yours because it's

201
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,160
important to be able to understand that it
can happen over a long time and sometimes

202
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,630
when he's talking about apathy, when it's
happened for a long time, people don't,

203
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,840
less and less and less, revolt, Okay?

204
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,970
- Could we possibly do Cuba in the history
one?

205
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:27,634
- Oh I think you could! Work on that,
that's a great idea.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,620
How are we coming?

207
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,160
- Good, we're done.
- Good, done

208
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,070
- I think we are finished.

209
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,320
- I want to hear your, uh, everyday life
one.

210
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,000
- All right, our, for our teenager?
- Yes.

211
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,350
- All right, we're saying, like, if
there's a group of popular kids and

212
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:48,570
they're like calling names and putting
down a group of the not-so-popular kids

213
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,230
and they're just not treating them like
they're normal people too, they're just

214
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,650
treating them like lesser people.

215
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,220
- Less than human?

216
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,780
- They might, they might not pay attention
to them, also, they just...

217
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:08,440
- In the way you wouldn't necessarily
recognize a theme, but in a way, you would

218
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,220
never ignore a human or we would think
should never ignore a human being. Okay,

219
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,620
great. So I want you, as you're looking
back over yours, make sure that you've

220
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,190
given your reader or your listener enough
information. My shortest one was like

221
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,610
three sentences and there's nothing magic
about the number of sentences, just check

222
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,900
yours because you're a little ahead of
everyone else for thoroughness and see if

223
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,566
there's any details you
could add. Okay great.

224
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,750
How are we coming?
- Um, good.

225
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:44,890
- Pretty much done.

226
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,680
- Awesome, awesome. You've got three of
the four? Which ones did you do?

227
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,260
- Um, the tell us a time in history when
the quotation applies and the fiction

228
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
quotation and the teenagers of life.

229
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,850
- And your quotation was?

230
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:05,330
- Oh, we did, um, it is wrong to use
immoral means to attain moral ends, the

231
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,370
last temptation is the greatest treason to
do the right deed for the wrong reasons.

232
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,980
- Thank y'all for choosing that one,
that's a very hard one

233
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,800
- And we put
[Inaudible].

234
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:19,160
- And the third one, great. Now will some
body tell me what your fictional one was?

235
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,884
- Um, we did... why don't you explain
this one Isabelle?

236
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:24,553
- Okay, I did Peter Pan.

237
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:24,980
- Uh-huh.

238
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:32,090
- 'Cause when Peter Pan, he persuades, or, he
offers to take the children to the other

239
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,570
place and it sounds wonderful to them, but
he's doing it for the wrong reasons.

240
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,650
- What reasons do you think he's really
doing it?

241
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,760
- To have a mother for the children, the
lost children.

242
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,620
- And so he's not really thinking of their
well-being, he's thinking of his and the

243
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,410
lost boys' well-being.
- Right.

244
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,730
- What a great connection. I'm so proud of
y'all! That's awesome! And did you do

245
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,830
news?
- Uh, we did history.

246
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,980
- History, what's your historical one?

247
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,000
- Uh, we did, uh, when the
Europeans-
