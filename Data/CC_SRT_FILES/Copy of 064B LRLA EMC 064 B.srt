1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
- I have a dream that my four children
will one day live in a nation where they

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,820
will not be judged by the color of their
skin, but by the content of their

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,590
character. I have a dream that one day the
state of Alabama will--

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,220
- Will be.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,376
- Will be transformed into a situation
where little black boys and black girls

6
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:30,975
will be able to join hands with little
white boys and white girls

7
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,669
as sisters and brothers.

8
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:39,311
- My dad and I have that dream too.

9
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:44,674
- When we let freedom ring, we will let it
rumble. We will let it ring from every

10
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:50,330
village and every hamlet and every state
in every city. We will be able to see that

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,710
day when all of God's children, black men
and white men, Jews and Gentiles,

12
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:00,360
Protestants and Catholics will join hands
and sing the words of the old Negro

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,479
spirit, "Free at last. Free at last. Thank
God almighty. We are free at last."

14
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,610
- Dad, when I listen to Reverend King, I
know that he's right.

15
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,815
I know that things are going to change.

16
00:01:13,815 --> 00:01:15,533
- I think you're right.

17
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:22,796
- Act IV--It is now spring of 1963. The
speech of Reverend King has continued to

18
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:26,465
lead people and speak out their
[inaudible].

19
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:29,809
He has met with another president, Lyndon
B. Johnson,

20
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:32,038
and has seen changes sweep
across the country.

21
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:35,381
- May, Billy, please come in here.
I have some news.

22
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:37,030
- What is it Mom?

23
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,163
- Reverend King is dead. He was shot in
Memphis, Tennessee.

24
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:45,389
- No, Mom. That's not fair. He was
helping all of us.

25
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:51,008
- I agree, Billy. It isn't fair. But
remember, Reverend King lives on in us.

26
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:57,840
Every time we remember the words, every
time we speak out against things that are

27
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,761
unfair, we are giving remembrance.

28
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:11,721
- Okay? So, go find the people that had
your card and have your conversations, get

29
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:14,019
your feedback about how you did.

30
00:02:45,388 --> 00:02:47,965
- Miss Walters, I got all three too.

31
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,125
- Great. Great.

32
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,675
- Did you see me? I had nine points.

33
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,740
- You were a good listener.

34
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:29,611
- Very good. Great feedback.
