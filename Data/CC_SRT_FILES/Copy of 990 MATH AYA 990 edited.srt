1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,478
- [Teacher] Megan, what quadrant

2
00:00:03,478 --> 00:00:06,091
am I going to be centered in?

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:10,262
- Quadrant four?

4
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:15,262
- [Teacher] Good, okay, so I'm gonna
go to the right six,

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:21,639
and down five...

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,471
I know my radius is three root seven.

7
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:30,076
Now, this may be a little
difficult for you,

8
00:00:30,076 --> 00:00:33,286
because three root seven
is kind of a hard number

9
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:35,153
to wrap your mind around.

10
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:37,776
Any thoughts on how we
can tell which quadrants

11
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:38,790
this goes into?

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,404
I want to know if it goes
into quadrant one first.

13
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:42,684
Twink, what could we do?

14
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:44,561
- Do you un-simplify it,
so when it gets through

15
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,281
the center, it'd be
like, square root of 63,

16
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,587
and then you like, have...,
so it's in-between eight,

17
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:53,723
nine, or I know it's
in-between seven and eight.

18
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:55,948
- [Teacher] Okay, did you guys follow her on that?

19
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:56,802
- [Students] Yeah!

20
00:00:56,802 --> 00:01:00,097
- Yeah, okay, so Twink
knows that this decimal

21
00:01:00,097 --> 00:01:02,124
is going to be between seven and eight,

22
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:05,260
because she knows it's
the square root of 63.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,777
And the square root of 64 is eight.

24
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,678
So, it's just below eight. All right?

25
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:12,960
So, you may be able to picture
a decimal in your mind,

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,182
close to eight, but not
quite, so we're armed

27
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:18,667
with that knowledge, true or false,

28
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,344
this circle goes into quadrant one.

29
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,955
Melissa.

30
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:27,286
- [Melissa] (inaudible)

31
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,457
- [Teacher] Agree?

32
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:29,220
- [Students] No.

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,025
- [Teacher] Ben?

34
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:34,916
- Yes, it does go into quadrant one.

35
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:38,569
- [Teacher] Do you have anything to back that up?

36
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:42,760
- [Ben] Yeah, because it only, the
center point is down six,

37
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,101
and if we go up one
more than that, at least.

38
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,200
- [Teacher] James?

39
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,091
- It's down five, and
since it's more than seven,

40
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:53,544
it's gotta be at least past the two.

41
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:54,730
- There were a lot of pronouns there.

42
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,447
What James was saying is, we're

43
00:01:56,447 --> 00:02:00,437
five units below the
x-axis, the radius is seven

44
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:04,746
point something units long,
so we're going to top out

45
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,007
right around there.

46
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,364
There's the top of our circle, okay.

47
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:12,489
Let's speed up this
process a little bit here.

48
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,454
The, is it going to go
into quadrant three?

49
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,268
- [Students] Yes.

50
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:19,037
- Why, Abby Simpson?

51
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:22,952
- [Abby Simpson] Because it's over six, 
and yeah,

52
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,520
you count seven the other way.
- [Teacher] Okay?

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,526
- [Abby Simpson] Or a little over seven.

54
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:28,584
- [Teacher] So, we're going to be there. 
Oh, and now

55
00:02:28,584 --> 00:02:31,571
for the great dilemma, will this circle

56
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:35,752
go into quadrant two,
Robert, what am I going

57
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:38,236
to have to resort to?

58
00:02:38,236 --> 00:02:41,163
- [Robert] The distance formula?

59
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:42,422
- [Teacher] I can't hear you.

60
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,128
- [Robert] The distance formula.

61
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,283
- [Teacher] Okay,
give me some more pairs

62
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:51,195
to plug into this formula.

63
00:02:53,635 --> 00:02:55,061
William?

64
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:59,733
- Zero, sorry, zero minus six squared,

65
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,957
and then zero plus five squared.

66
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:22,092
- [Teacher] All right.

67
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,977
Now what is the square root of 61

68
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:33,225
in simplified radical form?

69
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,716
Rue?

70
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,526
- Is it just square root of 61?

71
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:44,808
- [Teacher] Good, maybe
that was a trick question.

72
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,759
Maybe not, it's not going
to break down any further,

73
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,893
because 61 is what type of number again?

74
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:49,725
- [Rue] Prime.

75
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:52,562
- [Teacher] Prime, okay, so,

76
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:57,117
we've got square root
of 61. Robert, you told

77
00:03:57,117 --> 00:04:01,223
me to use distance formula,
I used distance formula.

78
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,356
I followed your orders to the T.

79
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:07,335
I still don't know if this
goes into quadrant two or not.

80
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:09,735
- It does not.

81
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:12,473
- [Teacher] The circle
doesn't make it to quadrant two?

82
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:13,372
- [Robert] No.

83
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:15,387
- [Teacher] So, you're
saying it does this?

84
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:17,135
- [Robert] Yes.

85
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,231
- Prove it.

86
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:24,340
- [Robert] Well if you
actually put, I don't know...

87
00:04:26,181 --> 00:04:29,388
- (laughter)

88
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:32,022
- [Robert] Call on someone else please.

89
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,729
- [Teacher] Maddie.

90
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,046
- Since you know that your
radius is the square root

91
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,851
of 63, and that's a larger
number than the square root

92
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:42,731
of 61, it therefore passes the origin,

93
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:46,165
and it goes into the opposite quadrant,

94
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:49,013
or quadrant two in this case.

95
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,737
- So, you're saying it goes like that.

96
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:56,283
- [Maddie] Correct.

97
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:59,408
- Is that good enough
for your piece of mind?

98
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:06,683
The radius is longer than
it needs to be to reach.

99
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:11,297
And therefore yeah, you're right.

100
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:13,473
Moral of the story?
The circle goes through

101
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:15,808
all four quadrants. So far,

102
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:17,408
we've kind of been in, been there,

103
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:20,246
done that land, and so now I'm going

104
00:05:20,246 --> 00:05:22,662
to take you into some new stuff, right now.

105
00:05:22,662 --> 00:05:25,297
The x and y intercepts.

106
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:31,441
First, the x-intercepts of this graph.

107
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,530
How am I going to find
where this circle collides

108
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,942
with the x-axis?

109
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,829
Let me ask an intermediate question,

110
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,360
what do you know about every
x-intercept in the universe?

111
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,259
They all have something in common, Abby?

112
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,470
- [Abby] All of their lines,
like the y equals zero?

113
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,165
- [Teacher] What, I'm sorry.

114
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,139
- Okay, all like the y's equal zero...
like the y?

115
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,953
- [Teacher] Which variable?

116
00:06:02,953 --> 00:06:03,987
- Y.

117
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:04,926
- [Teacher] Equals?

118
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:05,821
- Zero.

119
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:06,974
- [Teacher] One more time.

120
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:08,435
- Y equals zero.

121
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,472
- Okay does that makes sense to you guys?

122
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:11,464
- [Students] Yeah.

123
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:13,927
- Because if you do go up or
down to plot your ordered pair,

124
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:17,458
I've got bad news for you,
you're not on the x-axis any more.

125
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,583
Thus, it's not an x-intercept.

126
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,126
All right, just one more time Abby,

127
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,466
I forgot what you had said earlier.

128
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,522
- [Abby] Y equals zero.

129
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:28,543
- Okay, so how am I going to
find my x-intercepts here?

130
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,293
Twink?

131
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:31,615
- [Twink] I have a question, does it like,

132
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:34,111
the circle cross over x,
like the x-axis twice?

133
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,329
- [Teacher] Well, we'll
find out if it does.

134
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,663
- [Twink] I mean sometimes, doesn't it?

135
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,740
- [Teacher] Yeah.

136
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,945
- [Twink] So, what do you do if it does?

137
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,530
- [Teacher] So, this is the first
time in your math careers

138
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,794
where you might have two x-intercepts.

139
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:49,487
Colliding once, and coming
back down and colliding again

140
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:53,252
with the x-axis, that's good instincts.

141
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:54,937
And I'll just warn you right now,

142
00:06:54,937 --> 00:06:57,209
yeah, we're going to have
two x-intercepts here.

143
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,876
Maddie, how are we
going to find these two?

144
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:03,332
- [Maddie] We use the formula of a circle,

145
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:06,233
and we plug in for y, zero?

146
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,891
- [Teacher] Okay, so let's get the equation up here,

147
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,374
because I forgot to write it earlier.

148
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:14,547
Josh?

149
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:18,100
- [Josh] Ah, I don't remember.

150
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,265
- Ella May?

151
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:24,372
- [Ella May] X squared...

152
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:31,266
X squared plus, or minus six?

153
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,572
Or no, x minus six.

154
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:36,998
- [Teacher] Okay.

155
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:42,402
- [Ella May] Squared, plus y?

156
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:46,487
Plus five.

157
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:51,916
Squared, equals 63.

158
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:55,847
- Okay, Maddie, now we have our equation,

159
00:07:55,847 --> 00:07:58,086
and you said to do what to it?

160
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,742
- Since you know you
have, when you're looking

161
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:03,590
for an x-intercept, you're
always going to have zero

162
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,147
for your y.

163
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,619
- [Teacher] Oh, Abby told us that.

164
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,800
- Yeah, you have your y in
that formula equal zero.

165
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:20,218
- [Teacher] Literally, literally.
- [Ben] (inaudible)

166
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:24,335
Well, we've got to see what x is, Ben.

167
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:27,354
- [Ben] Well, I know but that's it?

168
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:28,762
- Does it make sense to you?

169
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:29,657
- [Ben] Yeah!

170
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,119
- It isn't that hard of a concept,

171
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,775
and that's why I had Abby
repeat it eight times.

172
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:37,295
If you get that y
literally has to be zero,

173
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,771
you understand why you
literally make y zero,

174
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:41,531
and then solve for x.

175
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:43,501
We're finding, here's one of
the ordered pairs right here

176
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:45,591
that we're searching
for, and I'll be darned if

177
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,271
the y is gonna be zero. The
question is, what's the x?

178
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:53,249
All right, so I've got x minus six squared.

179
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:59,857
Plus, I'm just going to write
five squared equals 63.

180
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:06,470
So, according to my calculations,

181
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,240
we have that right there.

182
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,374
Mason?

183
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:16,860
- [Mason] You forgot that middle term.

184
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,860
It should be minus 12 x?
Yeah, or something like that.

185
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:27,569
You forgot the middle
term. You forgot, like, the something x.

186
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,406
Yeah, it'd be x squared minus 12 x,

187
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,151
and then plus 36.

188
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:34,807
- Oh, so I need to square both those terms?

189
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,975
- [Mason] Yes, no wait, what'd you say?

190
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:40,780
- I just wanted to square the
x and square the negative six.

191
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,508
- [Mason] No you
didn't, you wanted to square

192
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:43,670
the whole thing.

193
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,139
- Okay, which means we
utilize what process in math?

194
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:49,532
What's that called again, Twink?

195
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:50,368
- [Twink] Foil?

196
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:53,920
- [Teacher] Foil, we had forgotten our oi, Ben.

197
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,088
- [Ben] Where did we get 12 x from?

198
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,709
- Vanessa?

199
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:02,976
- We squared x minus six,
so we used factoring.

200
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:06,047
We did x minus (inaudible).

201
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:08,202
- Now do you see where we get it from, Ben?

202
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:11,417
Okay, thank you Ben.

203
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,754
What to do with the 63,
what to do, what to do?

204
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:18,618
Mason?

205
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,413
- Do you just combine, like
subtract 63 from both sides,

206
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,940
combine all the like terms
of the whole numbers,

207
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,002
and then you have a quadratic equation.

208
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,018
- [Teacher] Okay.

209
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:33,569
Well, now I have a quadratic trinomial,

210
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:36,203
and it's arranged in what?

211
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,294
What do we call that, Kate?

212
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:41,714
- [Teacher] Ellie?

213
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:43,133
- Descending order.

214
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:48,686
- Mm-hm. Nice, so let's try and factor that.

215
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:52,270
Michelle, you're shaking
your head like no way.

216
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,587
- [Michelle] It doesn't work.
Well, all right, then I guess we're stuck.

217
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:58,915
- (class boos and laughs)

218
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:00,603
- [Student] That's so stupid.

219
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:06,558
- [Student] Don't we have to do 
the quadratic formula?

220
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:09,587
- [Teacher] Yes, if only I could
remember that though.

221
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,294
It's been such a long time.
- [Student] Sing the song! (laughter)

222
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:18,191
You tell me the song, I'll
actually write the line

223
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:21,775
pertinent to this problem,
what's the first line?

224
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:26,494
- (inaudible)
- [Teacher] Keep going...

225
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,382
- [Students] (singing) Plus or minus the root

226
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:33,785
of b squared minus 4 a-c,

227
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:37,736
all over 2a. (laughter)

228
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,486
- [Teacher] Okay.

229
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:45,257
I'm going to do some of the math for you,

230
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,985
and then I'm going to have
you do some of the math

231
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,957
for me, because I'm more
interested in seeing

232
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,173
that you can do this.

233
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:53,874
So, I get 12 plus or minus the square root

234
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:57,825
of 152, over two.

235
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:04,583
Now normally, normally I would
have you guys simplify that

236
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:08,646
and give me exact answers.
But it's hard on a graph

237
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,654
for you guys to see where
something like 12 plus

238
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,694
root 152 is, I mean that's
kind of an abstract.

239
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:18,054
- So, we're actually, I'm going
to let you do decimals here.

240
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:20,187
So, here's what I want to do, Kevin's row

241
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,935
through Sarah's row, I want you guys

242
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:25,179
to find the plus branch, so you do plus.

243
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,522
You two rows, find the minus.

244
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:46,660
12 minus root 152 over two.

245
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,510
As soon as you get an answer, real quietly

246
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,249
and quickly check with a neighbor,

247
00:12:52,249 --> 00:12:53,902
and make sure we have confirmation.

248
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,099
Let's go to the nearest hundredth.

249
00:12:56,099 --> 00:13:28,659
- (students discuss with each other)

250
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,022
Okay, if you've got an answer

251
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:37,374
that corresponds to what
your neighbor got, regroup.

252
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:39,128
Regroup, Ellie.

253
00:13:40,723 --> 00:13:42,130
If you've got the same
answer as your neighbor,

254
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,042
raise your hand right now, over here.

255
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:47,050
So, Melissa, what was
the value of x you got?

256
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,692
- [Melissa] 12.2.

257
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,793
- [Teacher] 12.2, what is it to
the nearest hundredth?

258
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:54,463
- [Melissa] Oh, 12.16.

259
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:59,203
- [Teacher] 12.16. All right, 
that sounds about right.

260
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:04,403
And then over here, my
branch with the negative sine

261
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,703
in there, Ellie?

262
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:09,892
- [Ellie] Negative 0.16.

263
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,071
- Okay, now let's not lose
sight of big picture here.

264
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:17,744
Context, what the heck's going on?

265
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:20,220
Why have we been trying to chase down x,

266
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,808
and why are we getting
two different answers?

267
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:24,262
And which one is right,
and which one's extraneous?

268
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:26,129
Help me make sense of all this,

269
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,870
now that the procedure is done, Michelle?

270
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,640
- [Michelle] Neither of them are extraneous,

271
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,157
because the circle hits
the x-axis at two points?

272
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:36,027
- [Teacher] So, what
are my two x-intercepts?

273
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,661
- 12.16, and negative .16?

274
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,965
- [Teacher] In ordered pair form.

275
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:45,965
- 12.16, zero,
and negative .16, zero.

276
00:14:48,315 --> 00:14:51,835
- There's that one right
there, makes sense.

277
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:56,186
And then the 12.16,
zero hopefully you have room

278
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,843
on your paper, I don't have
room on the board for that.

279
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:01,898
Should be somewhere over here.

280
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:06,565
It's a good pit stop moment right here.

281
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,367
Pull off to the side of the road.

282
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:12,607
Stop for a second, are you
sure this makes sense to you?
