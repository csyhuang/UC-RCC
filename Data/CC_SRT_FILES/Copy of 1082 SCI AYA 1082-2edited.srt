1
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:04,447
Well, since there's less,

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:05,972
- The yellow has less water

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:06,567
- That's true.

4
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:07,367
- And more H plus.

5
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:10,343
- Because a higher
concentration of (background chatter)

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,261
- The higher the
concentration of the acid?

7
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:15,890
- Yes.
- Yes.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,469
- So you think it's
something about the acid

9
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,813
that's causing the color.

10
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:19,793
- Yeah.

11
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,842
- What about the blue food coloring?

12
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:23,506
(background chatter)

13
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:24,743
This stays the same?

14
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:25,458
- Yeah.

15
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,914
- But why would you
think this stays the same

16
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,367
and it's the acid that's changing color?

17
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:36,367
(background chatter)

18
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:40,507
Okay, so the concentration
of the blue food coloring

19
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,737
is the same, but the
amount of acid is not.

20
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,955
So I must be changing
the color of the acid.

21
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,782
So it's the acid that's changing color.

22
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:48,849
- You're not
changing the color of the acid,

23
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,161
though.

24
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:52,199
- Anybody else got ideas about that?

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,057
That something else that could explain it?

26
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:56,156
That's one hypothesis.

27
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,361
- You put the same
amount of food coloring

28
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,268
in every time, right?

29
00:00:58,268 --> 00:00:59,121
- Yeah.

30
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:03,877
- Wait, so the acid is probably likely to,

31
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:08,411
maybe like lose an electron?

32
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:10,043
- The acid loses electrons?

33
00:01:10,043 --> 00:01:11,812
(background chatter)

34
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:12,826
What is an acid?

35
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:15,407
(background chatter)

36
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:16,825
It gives up an H plus, right?

37
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:21,825
- There are more
moles of Hydrogen ions...

38
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,424
- Right, acid's dissociate.

39
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:26,845
So I got more molds of H plus in this one.

40
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:28,880
Okay, Emma, you have an idea?

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,971
- Well, there are more,

42
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,731
I think I might have gotten it confused.

43
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:37,731
Basically, there's a higher
concentration of acid

44
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,858
as you go along, right?

45
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:42,202
- So more here.

46
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,194
- Yeah.

47
00:01:43,194 --> 00:01:44,186
There's more when it's lighter.

48
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,413
- Lowest, most.

49
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:46,074
- Yeah, I know.

50
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:47,013
- Okay.

51
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,860
- So that gives it more reason for a

52
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,588
more drastic color change, then.

53
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:56,588
Because there are more
H pluses, if you will,

54
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:59,897
that could cause it to jump in energy.

55
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:02,958
- Okay, so you got the idea
of energy is some kind of,

56
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,134
something's jumping.

57
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:06,979
Because you know...

58
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,425
- Could it be the
separation between the two sets

59
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:14,264
of the orbital in the food
coloring itself that's changing?

60
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,054
- Okay.

61
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:17,399
- Which is why the
blue color changes to the,

62
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,619
like, brownish yellow.

63
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:23,468
- So now what is your idea
about what's changing color?

64
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:28,468
- The orbital, the food
coloring is changing color.

65
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:30,346
- The food coloring is changing color.

66
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:32,906
- Yeah, the food, okay,
so that makes sense.

67
00:02:32,906 --> 00:02:34,293
The food coloring is changing color,

68
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,616
but the acid concentration
is making it change color.

69
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:37,097
- Yeah.

70
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:39,131
- So the food coloring's like
the dependent variable, right?

71
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:41,648
- What is in the food coloring?

72
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:43,440
- That's a good question.
- That's what we need to know.

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,008
- What is in the food coloring?

74
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:48,826
The same thing that's in the
cabbage indicator, actually.

75
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:51,951
Well, something similar,
they're called anthocyanins.

76
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:55,128
And I have a little handout to
show you what they look like.

77
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,597
So, before we do that though.

78
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:03,637
Actually, no, I'll show you
a picture of an anthocyanin

79
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:07,771
and have you hypothesize a little bit more

80
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,168
about what might be happening here.

81
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:11,211
So here's an anthocyanin.

82
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,458
It's this molecule here.

83
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,334
So usually anthocyanins have
lots of benzene rings in them.

84
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:31,614
Okay?

85
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:36,614
So what is happening, what is
causing the different colors?

86
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:40,723
So we had the idea of
something to do with orbitals

87
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,525
and something jumping.

88
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,485
- In the food coloring.

89
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:45,042
- In the food coloring.

90
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:48,317
- But the food coloring
isn't transition metal.

91
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,717
- It's not a transition metal, no.

92
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:53,479
- Can you still have that happen?

93
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,751
- Well, what else could there be?

94
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,396
- Well I think it's the O-H because,

95
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:01,435
- Is it like splitting up the p-orbitals?

96
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:03,174
- What makes you say that?

97
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:05,840
- There's like SP-3 orbitals

98
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,822
and I guess p2 orbitals 
(background chatter).

99
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:14,054
- Okay, so are you saying
it's that splitting

100
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,914
of SP-3 and SP-2 orbitals
or the P orbitals?

101
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,367
- I was thinking
it's the P orbitals.

102
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:22,770
- Okay, so what here would
represent the P orbitals?

103
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,770
- Whatever bonded with the acid.

104
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,816
The O-H maybe?

105
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:35,658
- Oh, would it be the 
(background chatter) no.

106
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,279
- Okay, so here's what we're going to do.

107
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,419
I'm going to give you this handout,

108
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,161
and what I would like you to do.

109
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,784
I want you to highlight
all of the double bonds

110
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,958
in one color.

111
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,441
Then I want you to highlight
all of the single bonds

112
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,733
in another color, okay?

113
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,775
You should have
highlighters by your table.

114
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:55,308
- Purple.

115
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,161
- I'll take green.

116
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:19,782
(background chatter)

117
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:22,000
- Do you want us
to do it for all of them?

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,558
- Yeah, let's
just do it, let's do it

119
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,799
for the first one to start with.

120
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,443
Anthocyanins in red wine, we'll do that.

121
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:34,896
So, anthocyanins are in lots
of different compounds.

122
00:05:34,896 --> 00:05:38,052
Anything that has color
really, wine, grapes,

123
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:43,052
cabbage, red onions, food coloring.

124
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:02,452
- Are they, they're not
in colorless though, right?

125
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:03,860
Or are they?

126
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,788
- Say it again?

127
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:07,968
- They can't be colorless,
because it's colorless.

128
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,578
- Well, kind of, you'll see.

129
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,770
We'll explain that in a little bit, yeah.

130
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,024
- Is something colorless
because they don't have

131
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:20,153
any d electrons,
or like the d-orbital

132
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:23,921
is filled up with electrons?

133
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:24,775
Or are there other factors?

134
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,706
- Yes, that's true for transition metals,

135
00:06:26,706 --> 00:06:28,829
- But for other things?

136
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,291
- For other things that are colorless,

137
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,120
what would explain why
they were colorless?

138
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,961
- It would have to
be a different orbital.

139
00:06:36,215 --> 00:06:37,498
- Different wave length.

140
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:41,043
- Like the absorption, based on the bond.

141
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:43,695
Yes to both of you.

142
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,065
So Riley's idea is that
maybe, so what did we say

143
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,156
color came from earlier?

144
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:55,822
(background chatter)

145
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:59,011
Color in general, where does
color in general come from?

146
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:03,459
Reflecting certain frequencies,

147
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:06,403
and absorbing other
frequencies of light right?

148
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:11,129
Okay, so we can only see purple to red.

149
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,675
So is there another explanation for why

150
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,382
something might be colorless?

151
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,598
Because it ...

152
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,531
- Probably because
it's absorbing everything?

153
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,651
- Well, if it was absorbing everything,

154
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,429
what color would it be?

155
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:21,505
- Black.

156
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:23,597
- Oh, it's not absorbing anything.

157
00:07:23,597 --> 00:07:25,421
- It's not absorbing anything?

158
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,456
Or not absorbing ...

159
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,542
- Any color.

160
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:28,941
- It's not
absorbing what we can see.

161
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,424
- It's not absorbing what
we can see, that's right.

162
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,621
It's not absorbing what we can see.

163
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:35,444
- It reflects all the colors.

164
00:07:38,474 --> 00:07:40,379
- So, you guys see a pattern yet?

165
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:46,886
Can I borrow somebody's?

166
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:48,240
Let me borrow yours.

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,466
Let's put it under the camera

168
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:50,369
as an example here.

169
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:58,612
What do you notice?

170
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:03,155
- Were we supposed to highlight...

171
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:04,039
- Single bonds, yes.

172
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,425
What do you notice about the relationships

173
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,478
between double and single bonds?

174
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,216
The double bonds right next to each other?

175
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:17,882
- The double bonds are
next to the single bonds.

176
00:08:17,882 --> 00:08:19,938
- The double bond
are next to the single bonds.

177
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:21,469
That's right, that's right.

178
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,586
Okay, in the first one, where you have,

179
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:28,273
What color is the first one, does is say?

180
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:29,841
- It just says colored.

181
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:30,940
- Red wine.

182
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,073
- But we have colored
and we have colorless.

183
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:38,073
Okay, so in the colored one,

184
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:40,155
how many, can you count how many times

185
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:44,243
it goes double-single,
double-single, double-single?

186
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:48,581
That's like a tongue twister.

187
00:08:48,581 --> 00:09:01,541
(background chatter)

188
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,821
- It's seven in colored?

189
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,759
- I got seven.

190
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,784
- Okay, so now count colorless
and see what you get.

191
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:08,169
What did you guys get?

192
00:09:08,169 --> 00:09:09,263
- For double-single?

193
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:12,454
I got like 14.

194
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:14,361
- Okay, so are you counting
double and single as ...

195
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:15,140
- Yeah, yeah.

196
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,889
- Okay so you basically got seven, too.

197
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,138
Okay, so do colorless now.

198
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,281
- Double bonds between

199
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:28,281
every single bond, between
the bonds with the C N-O.

200
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:30,406
- I got eight for colored.

201
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:51,421
(background chatter)

202
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:56,421
- I got 17 in the singles,
and eight doubles for that.

203
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,810
- Okay, what's the difference between

204
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,805
colored and colorless, basically?

205
00:10:00,805 --> 00:10:02,874
And the number of double and single bonds?

206
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:04,207
- There are more
singles than colorless.

207
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,074
- Okay, not the total numbers,

208
00:10:06,074 --> 00:10:08,089
oh wait, there's more
singles than colorless?

209
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,660
Okay, that's a way we can look at it.

210
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:15,560
Okay, see if the same...

211
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,484
- We got seven for colorless.

212
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:21,672
- Okay.

213
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:23,113
- Is it supposed to be the same number?

214
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:24,713
- No no, no it's not
supposed to be the same.

215
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:29,713
(background chatter)

216
00:10:30,686 --> 00:10:33,352
Alright, let's hear
what Gracie has to say.

217
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:34,472
Say what you just said.

218
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:36,605
- So, in colored there's more doubles

219
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:39,197
and there's less singles.

220
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:41,170
So that means that
there's going to be more

221
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,738
of the single-doubles.

222
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:45,170
But then in colorless there's less doubles

223
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,194
and more singles,

224
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,289
so that means there's less single-doubles.

225
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:55,292
- Can somebody restate that?

226
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:56,459
Just so that I can make sure that you

227
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,272
understand what she said?

228
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:01,013
- Does that mean that if there are more

229
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:05,018
double bonds than there
are, that colors (background chatter).

230
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:08,799
- So, say it again.

231
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,143
- When there are more double bonds

232
00:11:10,143 --> 00:11:12,618
there's a color, or something.

233
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:13,898
- Okay, when
there's more double bonds

234
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:15,327
there's a color.

235
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,732
Does that seem like the
pattern we're noticing here?

236
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,661
- It has to do with pi bonding.

237
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:25,655
- Why does it have to do with pi bonding?

238
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:29,344
- Because it's an overlap of p-orbitals.

239
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:31,275
- Overlap of p-orbitals.

240
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,166
- Which allows the delocalized
electrons to like...

241
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,095
- Okay, so what did you say, Con?

242
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,131
- Delocalization.

243
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:40,020
- Delocalization, the
delocalization comes from...

244
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,836
(background chatter)

245
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,676
Pi bonds, what is a pi bond?

246
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:45,796
It's the overlap of what?

247
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:46,692
- P-orbitals.

248
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,655
- P-orbitals, p-orbitals okay.

249
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:50,927
So when it goes
double-single, double-single,

250
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:54,052
double-single, what's happening there?

251
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:55,929
How does that create...

252
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:59,022
- It's like one big pi bond.

253
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:02,423
Like when you have, like earlier

254
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:07,423
you were talking about
whatcha-ma-call-its,

255
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,739
I can't articulate...

256
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:10,753
- Delocalization?

257
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:12,107
- No, like...

258
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,697
- One giant p-orbital?

259
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:16,502
- Yeah, like sort of,
yeah one giant p-orbital.

260
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,811
Like one giant pi bond,
it like expands from like

261
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:21,920
through different,

262
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,733
- Oh, and like a benzene shape,

263
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:24,874
and then that makes a circle?

264
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:29,874
Yeah, and it's not actually
like here's one, 

265
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,537
here's one pi bond, here's
one pi bond, here's one.

266
00:12:33,537 --> 00:12:35,850
It's like they're like all pi bonded.

267
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,359
- They're like all
pi bonded to each other, okay.

268
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,465
So in which case, in
which case are they all

269
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:44,703
pi bonded to each other?

270
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:47,277
The colored form, or the colorless form?

271
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:53,123
(background chatter)

272
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:56,033
- I'd say colored
because they are all

273
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,288
close to each other.

274
00:12:58,288 --> 00:12:59,255
Like the pi bonds.

275
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,277
- The pi bonds, say it again.

276
00:13:00,277 --> 00:13:01,918
- They're close to each other.

277
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:05,325
- They're close to each
other in the colored form?

278
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:06,625
So is there more...

279
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,791
- There's more double bonds.

280
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,891
- There's more double
bonds in the colored?

281
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,878
- Yeah, so they would have
to be closer to each other.

282
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:18,297
(background chatter)

283
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,163
- There are more
double bonds in colored,

284
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:22,514
less double bonds in colorless.

285
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:27,349
- Okay, so how many of you
say there's less double bonds

286
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,938
in the colorless?

287
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:31,924
Less double bonds in the colorless?

288
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:33,364
Three.

289
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:35,434
- There's only seven double bonds

290
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:37,033
in colorless and there's eight in colored.

291
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,836
And there's more leftover singles.

292
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:43,393
(background chatter)

293
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:46,134
- Wait, for
which one, for colored?

294
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:52,139
- Oh, you're counting the far left one.

295
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:59,519
(background chatter)

296
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,874
- Yeah, this one has eight.

297
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,558
- This is an intermediate one?

298
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:07,913
- So then it's seven and seven.

299
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:11,476
- Seven and seven, okay.

300
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:15,359
So how many, if you
were to try to connect.

301
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,640
So the idea is that it
makes one giant p-orbital.

302
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,136
If you were going to connect
all of the p-orbitals,

303
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:23,508
which one would have the
most gigantic p-orbital?

304
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:24,745
- Colored

305
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:28,061
- Colored.

306
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,373
Is that clear to everybody?

307
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,731
Why did you say colorless?

308
00:14:31,731 --> 00:14:32,808
Did you say colorless?

309
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,473
- Yeah, I don't understand why.

310
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:36,742
- Because there's 
a bunch of single bonds.

311
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,216
- Because the pi bond is
more in the middle of the two

312
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:42,587
other things (background chatter).

313
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:43,952
- Wait, for the far left?

314
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,319
- Does that make any sense?

315
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,620
- We're talking
about the far left one.

316
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,430
- Let's look at all three.

317
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,648
So which one of these is going to have

318
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:53,983
the most giant pi bond?

319
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:55,873
- The middle one?

320
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,175
- The middle one.

321
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:58,294
- Because it's an intermediate.

322
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:00,386
- And they're more double bonds.

323
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:03,495
- Does anyone
disagree that it's going to be

324
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:08,239
the middle one that would
have the most giant p-orbital?

325
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,491
Okay.

326
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:20,156
Alright, let's look
at some more down here.

327
00:15:20,156 --> 00:15:22,866
Did you guys do, does somebody
have these highlighted?

328
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:24,403
- No.

329
00:15:24,403 --> 00:15:25,034
- I think Rebecca,

330
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:26,771
you have them highlighted, right?

331
00:15:26,771 --> 00:15:42,598
(background chatter)

332
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:45,771
- Okay, so let's look at these two here.

333
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,374
Can we apply our hypothesis?

334
00:15:50,377 --> 00:15:53,171
So what is our hypothesis by the way?

335
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:57,006
- More overlap of p-orbitals

336
00:15:57,006 --> 00:15:58,955
the more colored it is?

337
00:15:58,955 --> 00:16:00,386
- Okay, the more overlap of p-orbitals

338
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,501
the more colored it is.

339
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,788
That's our hypothesis.

340
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:08,788
Is it supported by these
two on the side here?

341
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:19,971
- Can we highlight the exterior?

342
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:27,606
- So what do you think?

343
00:16:27,606 --> 00:16:31,048
Is our hypothosis supported by these two?

344
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:39,000
Alright, Con, can you explain?

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,631
- Well, I mean it just
looks like there's a bunch

346
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:44,010
of conjunctions of single
bonds where the streak

347
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,579
of double-single is kind of broken.

348
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,579
- Okay, right, so there's
a streak of double-single,

349
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,004
double-single,
double-single, double-single,

350
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:56,329
double-single.

351
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,430
So imagine you start somewhere.

352
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,680
Have you guys ever heard
the song that never ends?

353
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,995
- Yes.

354
00:17:01,995 --> 00:17:04,811
♫ This is the song that never ends ♫

355
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:08,308
- Okay, we're not gonna
sing it, it never ends.

356
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,959
So in this case, if we were
to just go around going

357
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,084
double-single,
double-single, double-single,

358
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,832
double-single,
double-single, double-single,

359
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,909
double-single,
double-single, double-single,

360
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:19,630
would I ever get to an end necessarily?

361
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,151
Would I here?

362
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,518
How about if I went double, still single,

363
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:33,144
double- single,
double-single, double-single,

364
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:35,596
- But that's single, single.

365
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,498
- Single, single.

366
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:40,969
So which one's going to have
a more extensive pi bond?

367
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:44,736
The top one, so that sort
of fits our hypothesis

368
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:49,736
that the more pi bonding there
is, the more colored it is.

369
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:55,685
Okay, so what causes
color in these compounds?

370
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,387
- Shared electrons?

371
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:04,095
- More shared electrons,
that are shared how?

372
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:09,095
(background chatter)

373
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:12,032
- Pi bonds.

374
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:21,642
(background chatter)

375
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,212
- More pi bonds equals what?

376
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:26,828
- More area for
the electrons to move around?

377
00:18:26,828 --> 00:18:28,037
- Okay, more area for them.

378
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:32,164
More delocalization, okay.

379
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:36,691
So let's take it back to this,

380
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:41,682
to our acid and blue food
coloring demonstration.

381
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,979
Why are these different colors?

382
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,187
What is happening here?

383
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:59,852
(background chatter)

384
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,203
Let's put this together.

385
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:07,327
- Oh, is it the H is taking more of the

386
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:12,327
delocalized electrons
because H is positive?

387
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,199
- What do you think?

388
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:18,685
- Because there's a higher concentration.

389
00:19:18,685 --> 00:19:20,738
- So say it again.

390
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:23,578
- Okay so since H is a positive ion,

391
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,607
it takes more of the, since there's more,

392
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,954
it takes more of the
delocalized electrons?

393
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:28,986
- Okay, so it's taking more

394
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,722
of the delocalized electrons.

395
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:34,055
So how does that explain the color change?

396
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:37,269
Can somebody add onto that?

397
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:41,564
- There's less electrons
so I guess there's less...

398
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:44,181
- More double bonding?

399
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:48,029
- There's less energy absorbed?

400
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,329
- No, there's increased...

401
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:51,619
- So, is
more energy being absorbed,

402
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:53,321
or less energy being
absorbed when it's yellow?

403
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:56,264
- More energy is being absorbed
that's why it's yellow.

404
00:19:56,264 --> 00:19:58,472
- Exactly, that creates further 
(background chatter).

405
00:19:58,472 --> 00:19:59,926
- Because there are more electrons bonding

406
00:19:59,926 --> 00:20:02,226
with the H plus than there is in the...

407
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,235
- It's about absorption.

408
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,209
- Ah, okay Ruth, say that...
