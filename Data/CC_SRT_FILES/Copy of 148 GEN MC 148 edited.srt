1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,498
- [Boy in Camo] Anything else?

2
00:00:01,498 --> 00:00:04,157
- [Girl in striped shirt] So, 
what composter would you want?

3
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:07,570
- [Boy in camo] I think we would want maybe like

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,735
a three-tray or four-tray vermicomposter.

5
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:16,735
And I do now admit it
would be helpful to get one

6
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:21,040
that would be cheaper.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,970
Maybe you guys have a different idea?

8
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,323
- [Boy in brown] Maybe, I was thinking
that maybe we can make one,

9
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:30,447
because I printed off some
directions how to make

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,763
a vermicomposter.

11
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:35,790
So again, that would
save us a lot of money

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,777
just to make it.

13
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:43,572
Like, this might cost $20
to get all these supplies.

14
00:00:43,572 --> 00:00:46,741
And I know some people have
supplies at their houses

15
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:50,784
that they could bring in to use for this.

16
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:55,132
And this might cost $20,
when a store-bought one

17
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,672
off the internet may cost $100.

18
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:59,988
- [Girl in striped shirt] Yes, but the 
store-bought one's are quality,

19
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,877
and a professional makes it.

20
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:02,853
So they know what they're doing.

21
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:04,376
- [Boy in dark blue] I doesn't really 
matter, I mean it has the same purpose,

22
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:05,433
it does the same thing.

23
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,079
I just matters on the worms.

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,000
- [Boy in brown] The only thing that 
we really have to buy is the worms.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
- [Boy in camo] Dylan and Ben, I got to
admit, I do agree with Claire.

26
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:22,684
Buying one would be a good
quality and what do we know

27
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:27,156
about, I know it says. . .
what do we know, about...

28
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:30,524
- [Teacher] Now, where are
you guys in your conversation?

29
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:35,524
- [Girl in black] We're deciding 
to do wood, metal, or plastic.

30
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:38,753
But he said that the wood would rot

31
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:41,292
and the metal could rust.

32
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:44,259
- [Boy in striped shirt] It could rust 
because of the moistness of the compost.

33
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:45,153
- [Teacher] Okay.

34
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,565
- [Boy in white] It's not metal.
- [Boy in hoodie] We're not talking about metal.

35
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:50,662
- [Girl in black] So we might do plastic.

36
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:52,551
- [Teacher] On what?

37
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,445
- [Student] If we make it.

38
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,867
- [Teacher] Purchasing one?

39
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:56,472
- [Student] No, if we make our own.

40
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:56,945
(Background Chatter)

41
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,137
- [Boy in white] But this one is award-winning.

42
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:04,556
(Background Chatter)

43
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,834
- [Student] Seventy dollars.

44
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,947
- [Teacher] All right, and
did you know what website

45
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:11,688
you found that so you
could share it as a class?

46
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:15,306
(Background Chatter)

47
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:18,520
- [Teacher] This is
buying a vermicomposter

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,207
that would cost $70.

49
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:21,405
And what did you say about yours?

50
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:26,405
- [Boy in hoodie] This is about like
$20, because we need two

51
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:31,667
of these eight to 10 gallon
plastic storage boxes.

52
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:34,855
And we need two of them,
and it says the cost

53
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,090
is about five dollars each.

54
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,000
And that would save us
a lot so we could get

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,332
Weebly pro, tools, and then maybe later on

56
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:44,290
we could by the reusable bags.

57
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,915
- [Teacher] So what are
your thoughts on helping

58
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,579
the whole community?

59
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,379
- [Boy in hoodie] I think we should build
this because it's better

60
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,999
and we would have more money left over.

61
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:55,809
- [Teacher] And how would you spend

62
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,638
the other money left over?

63
00:02:57,638 --> 00:03:00,686
- [Boy in hoodie] I would spend it on
like, stuff that we need

64
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:03,021
for composting, like for tools.

65
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:05,866
- [Teacher] Okay, wait, we
have multiple conversations

66
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,431
going here in this group.

67
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,650
So let's wait.

68
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,101
- [Boy in hoodie] I would spend 
it on the tools, Weebly Pro,

69
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:12,970
and if we have some money left over

70
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,056
we could probably get
more from the compost.

71
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:20,346
And then we could get that tea
thing that gets the tea out.

72
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:22,176
And that way you could get more money.

73
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,309
And then we could get something else.

74
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:28,230
- [Boy in tie-dye] What's Weebly Pro?

75
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,230
- [Boy in hoodie] It's like an extra,

76
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:37,590
you can search it up on Google.

77
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,966
- [Girl in black] Isn't it a website?

78
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:46,966
- [Boy in gray hoodie] It's 26 compost, and then
you can have a many slides

79
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,861
as you want, videos.

80
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:54,808
And then we can sell our
compost on the internet,

81
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:57,145
and that would help a lot.

82
00:03:57,145 --> 00:04:01,452
- [Teacher] So, how is the Weebly
Pro better than the Weebly

83
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,691
that we already have?

84
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:06,470
Because you were the webmaster
on the class website,

85
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,892
on the composting website.

86
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:10,737
And you want to, what
do you want us to do?

87
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:14,658
- [Boy in gray hoodie] We can have, 
buy the six-month plan,

88
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:19,658
and then the guys for next
year, they figure it out.

89
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:24,776
- [Teacher] And how would us buying the Weebly Pro

90
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:27,011
help the community?

91
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:32,011
- [Boy in gray hoodie] It would help us 
to sell it and to inform about compost.

92
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:38,043
- [Teacher] Okay, any other comments or thought?

93
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:42,172
- [Boy in striped shirt] We could, 
it could maybe inform the people more

94
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:47,072
because we could make a
video of how to compost

95
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:50,261
so they could make their own.

96
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,199
- [Teacher] Okay, inform who?

97
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,439
Be more specific.

98
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,262
- [Boy in striped shirt] The viewers of the website.

99
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,092
- [Teacher] All of our guests?

100
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:58,656
- [Boy in white] Yeah.

101
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:04,105
- [Brunette girl in glasses] There's a 
greater chance it's not gonna fail.

102
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:06,624
- [Boy in camo] Guys, we're not
playing the what-if game.

103
00:05:06,624 --> 00:05:08,391
- [Boy in plaid] I not saying, 
but we have a chance that the cups

104
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,033
might break, because
they're cups and they have

105
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,192
an easier chance,

106
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:15,056
- [Brunette girl in glasses] It has a 
bigger chance of not failing.

107
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,600
- [Boy in brown] We have to take risks.

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,900
We have to.

109
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,465
- [Boy in dark blue] Plus,
you would have the pride

110
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:20,866
of making your own.

111
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:25,866
(Background Chatter)

112
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:29,075
- [Boy in gray] If we make our own, 
and we mess up,

113
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,213
then we're just wasting money.

114
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,330
- [Boy in dark blue] What
if, what if, what if, what it.

115
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,984
- [Boy in gray] I'm not doing the what-if!

116
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:37,767
- [Girl in green] ' Cause remember last time
when we built a-- (Background Chatter)

117
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,285
- [Girl in green shirt] If you make it, 
there is a greater chance you will fail.

118
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:48,292
- [Boy in camo] Maybe instead 
of cups, we use PVC pipes.

119
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:51,055
I mean, they're that cheap,
and I mean they would hold

120
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:54,062
longer than styrofoam cups.

121
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:58,516
(Background Chatter)

122
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:00,892
- [Teacher] Shhh, too many people.

123
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,248
- [Boy in gray] That's better quality.

124
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,564
- [Boy in camo] I
do agree with you, Adam,

125
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,616
but I also do agree with Dylan and Ben

126
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:11,875
on two different subjects.

127
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:15,232
- [Boy in brown] Guys, why don't 
we just make everything?

128
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:17,588
We can make the compost bin,

129
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,234
- [Boy in gray] But
if we make everything,

130
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:20,494
- [Boy in brown] reusable bags.

131
00:06:20,494 --> 00:06:29,887
(Background Chatter)

132
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:34,161
- [Boy in gray] Why don't we buy 
the vermicomposter,

133
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:37,245
and then we make the bags?

134
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:41,007
- [Blond girl in glasses] The reusable 
bags are more like, for people to buy

135
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,278
if they want to have an easy reusable bag.

136
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:48,321
And then the tools, we
might really need later on

137
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,414
when we don't need the reusable bags.

138
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:53,360
We might need the tools, or we said,

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,021
we might need to go buy
this now, and it might be

140
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:58,581
too late already.

141
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:01,872
- [Teacher] What's the major difference

142
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:06,872
between the vermicomposter
and the reusable bags?

143
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:10,446
Jessica, what's the major
difference between the two?

144
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,559
- [Brunette girl in glasses] In vermicomposting,
it keeps reproducing, there's three products.

145
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,398
While the reusable bags,
when you sell them once,

146
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:18,857
and that's all you get from that bag.

147
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:23,857
- [Boy in plaid] And with the 
vermicomposter, it keeps going.

148
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,024
It's very unlikely, almost impossible,

149
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:31,819
that all the worms are
going to die in one night.

150
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,740
- [Boy in dark blue] Plus,why would 
you buy the bags if you can make them?

151
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,442
'Cause my mom has a friend
that makes her own bags

152
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:41,856
out of store bags, like
Walmart and Target bags.

153
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,273
And she melts them down
and puts them into a bag.

154
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:47,423
- [Boy in gray] Why don't we 
buy the vermicomposter

155
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:50,084
so it's a better quality,
and we make the bags?

156
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,421
They're easier.

157
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:54,432
- [Boy in brown] It's very hard 
to find a perfect vermicomposter

158
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,693
that's plastic and won't break.

159
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:00,451
Most of them are terracotta
and they'll shatter

160
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:03,509
if somebody knocks it over.

161
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,509
It's also wood, and wood
will start to absorb the smells

162
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,671
of the compost and then it
will start to smell bad.

163
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,008
- [Boy in gray] How do you know 
we're going to do wood?

164
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:17,461
- [Boy in brown] Compost things on 
the internet are using

165
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:19,473
either terracotta or wood.

166
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:21,769
Terracotta shatters really easily.

167
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,024
(Background Chatter)

168
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,462
- [Teacher] Okay, so we need
to do more research on this.

169
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:31,462
- [Boy in gray] I found a four-tray 
bin that's plastic for $89.99.

170
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:35,909
- [Boy in brown] But still, why 
would we pay $100, when we can pay. . .

171
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,864
- [Boy in gray] For quality.

172
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:37,657
- [Boy in brown] ...a mere $20.

173
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:42,657
(Background Chatter debating necessity of quality)

174
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,727
- [Girl in striped shirt] I know, 
but the materials we use

175
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:47,612
aren't made for composting.

176
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,583
- [Teacher] Listen to Carly for a second.

177
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,273
What Carly?

178
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:53,768
- [Blond girl in glasses] Because if 
we do what Ben's mom's friend can do,

179
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:56,367
you could easily save
more money like you do

180
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,337
if you make the vermicomposter.

181
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,841
- [Teacher] Do you think you
could get your mom's friend

182
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:02,482
to come in and teach us
as a class on how to make

183
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,942
our own like she already does?

184
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,954
(Background Chatter)

185
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:10,067
- [Girl in green] I think we should buy
the vermicomposter first,

186
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:15,067
like buy it or make it, and
then buy the reusable bags.

187
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:20,898
So, just like Ben's mom's friend's bags.

188
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:25,020
- [Boy in brown] But we should make them
both, because then we will

189
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,358
still have some money left over to buy

190
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,573
other things like tools.

191
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:32,031
- [Student] Like a new aerator.

192
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:36,054
- [Boy in gray] If we make the reusable
bags we won't get to

193
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:41,054
put our symbol on it, which
I think is part of the bag.

194
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,348
- [Girl in black] We're thinking 
about doing ovens.

195
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:45,928
- [Boy in white] 'Cause it's like one,
two, three, four, five, six.

196
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,569
- [Girl in pink] If we made it, we
wouldn't have a guarantee

197
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,292
that it would work,
because we could screw up

198
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:52,511
the way we make it.

199
00:09:52,511 --> 00:09:56,473
Or we could just mess it up in general.

200
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:58,201
But if we bought one, it would be kind of

201
00:09:58,201 --> 00:09:59,988
guaranteed to work.

202
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:04,132
- [Girl in striped shirt] But sometimes 
we miss a part, or a tool that we need

203
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,575
to put it together.

204
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,383
- [Teacher] How do you
know that sometimes,

205
00:10:07,383 --> 00:10:09,191
what experience do you have that sometimes

206
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,634
all the parts aren't always there?

207
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,015
- [Girl in striped shirt] Because 
when we were making the other one

208
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:14,352
and forgot one of the
tools, so we couldn't do

209
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,404
one part of it.

210
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:19,806
And then it just all got all messed up.
- [Student] It just threw us off.

211
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:22,484
- [Teacher] So from your
experience you know that

212
00:10:22,484 --> 00:10:24,454
sometimes when we order something,

213
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:27,035
we don't always get it.

214
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:31,809
- [Boy in white] This part is the
leading thing right there,

215
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:32,500
it comes built.

216
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,812
All we have to do it put
the plastic bars together,

217
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:37,762
and it will be kind of easy.

218
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,733
'Cause it just like, goes.

219
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,907
Yeah, and you can work
as a group to make it.

220
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,081
Because it's like those styrofoams

221
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:45,564
where you pull it together.

222
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:49,706
And you can just see where
it's put together, the sticks.

223
00:10:49,706 --> 00:10:52,630
- [Teacher] Like the
couplers on the sides.

224
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,307
- [Boy in hoodie] So, we have 
something to be proud of that we made.

225
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,765
- [Girl in black] Everybody said 
that we wanted a see-through one

226
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,102
so we could actually see the dirt.

227
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:03,723
- [Teacher] And this
one's not see-through.

228
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:07,502
So, if we made our own,
could we get a clear tote?

229
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:10,500
(Background Chatter)

230
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,800
- [Boy in tie-dye] ...'cause the worms 
don't like light.

231
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,966
So you can lift to look.

232
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:14,666
And the worms don't like
light, so when you look at it,

233
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,673
lift it up, look at it
and then put it back down.

234
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:18,506
- [Teacher] That's a good idea.

235
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,436
No one else has thought
about that, Christian.

236
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:23,750
And how do you know that
the worms don't like light?

237
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,188
- [Boy in tie-dye] Because we looked it up on the internet.

238
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,093
- [Boy in white] And then one time 
I was in my house, and I saw a worm

239
00:11:29,093 --> 00:11:31,511
out in the street, and it was kind of like

240
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:33,481
rattling, rattling in the sun.

241
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,651
So then my sister kicked
it in, back in the grass.

242
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:41,651
So then it was much happier
and I re-research that.

243
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,667
- [Boy in gray hoodie] Okay, but 
do we have to do vermicompost?

244
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,455
- [Teacher] No, we don't
have to do it at all.

245
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:49,694
It's going to be our class.

246
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:51,320
We need to vote on what's
going to be the best

247
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,478
for the community.

248
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,346
- [Boy in tie-dye] What about reusable bags?

249
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,027
- [Boy in striped shirt] I think the 
reusable bags are (Background Chatter).

250
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:57,880
- [Teacher] And why?

251
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,831
How is the reusable
bags different than what

252
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:01,132
we're already doing?

253
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:05,133
- [Boy in striped shirt] If we sell the, 
if the people next year sell them

254
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,105
at the Holiday Boutique,

255
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,888
then if we sell compost, then it would be

256
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,386
the same customers.

257
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:17,386
And if we give the customer
something different

258
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:22,282
more people will come because, they'll

259
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:25,125
yeah, and they need bags.

260
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,630
- [Teacher] They could buy
bags to put their stuff in

261
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,134
that they buy?

262
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,429
- [Girl in striped shirt] And for backpacks and
stuff for when they go

263
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,680
grocery shopping they need
something to put them in

264
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,109
instead of just wasting
all those plastic bag.

265
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:38,932
They could use the reusable bag.

266
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,090
- [Boy in gray] I have an idea,

267
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,090
I think we should stick with
our old compost in our tumbler,

268
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,770
And then we should get the bags.

269
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,843
And we should have the
compost and the bags

270
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:50,900
of compost tea.

271
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,443
And then they could buy the bags,

272
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:53,926
and they could buy the compost,

273
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,522
and they could have the
compost tea in the bag

274
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:59,696
and they could carry it
so it's not that hard.

275
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,845
- [Teacher] So we could use our
bags as the packaging

276
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:03,700
for the compost?

277
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,324
- [Boy in striped shirt] Yeah, that's 
what I was thinking.

278
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:07,152
- [Girl in black] It's gonna cost extra.

279
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:11,969
- [Boy in striped shirt] And then 
make it just a bit more expensive

280
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:14,568
'cause then you get to
keep the reusable bag

281
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,553
and the compost.

282
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:21,308
- [Boy in white] You know, if you put
your money in the bank

283
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:22,689
they give you money?

284
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:25,391
This would basically give
you money, because you can

285
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,642
make the compost, yeah the interest, yeah.

286
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,141
So we can get the money
from this, and then we can

287
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,168
buy the bags for the high-level tea.

288
00:13:34,168 --> 00:13:35,449
- [Boy in gray] But that has no 
holes for the worms.

289
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,415
The sun is coming right into--
(Background Chatter)

290
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:45,981
But would it fit in our room?

291
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:49,067
- [Teacher] So, we need to
get more information on this.

292
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,546
- [Boy in gray] Remember we were talking about

293
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:55,271
the internet could be
wrong about its size?

294
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,442
- [Teacher] Yeah, but
normally they don't do

295
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,222
false advertisement,

296
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,859
- [Boy in white] This is like in a this--
(Background Chatter)--the bottom is like

297
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,505
this size of a desk.

298
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:06,918
- [Teacher] You could
compare this to this vase

299
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:09,479
or this container that they
would put the plant in.

300
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,835
- [Student] It's like a shower,

301
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,095
it's like the size of a shower.

302
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,070
- [Student] Yeah, you guys
need more information.

303
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,024
- [Teacher] We need more information

304
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:16,731
before you can make a decision on that?

305
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,820
- [Student] A lot of
information on this already.

306
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,436
- [Boy in white] But we won't 
make tea if this one

307
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:26,016
would have really worked, cause it's made.

308
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:29,409
You know, the more it
costs the better it works.

309
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,973
- [Teacher] Do you agree with his comment?

310
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,675
- [Some students] No.
- [Other Student] Yeah, that's what Cara said.

311
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,748
(Several students disagree.)

312
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:36,967
- [Teacher] Can anyone give an example?

313
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,812
- [Boy in striped shirt] I don't agree 
with that, because when I was real little

314
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:45,810
I bought some toy cars
and they didn't work

315
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,810
as well as I got--some that were cheaper.

316
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,838
And the cheaper ones worked
better than the expensive ones.

317
00:14:57,838 --> 00:15:00,006
- [Teacher] Okay, you guys
continue discussing that.
