1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:03,382
- Okay, so what we're doing,
is you guys are trying to

2
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:04,824
figure out which one of these

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:08,351
invisible tapes yeah, is the best.

4
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:11,312
So, the first thing you gotta
do is come up with a nice

5
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:14,023
question for your problem,
that you want to solve.

6
00:00:14,353 --> 00:00:17,482
Sharonda you wanna share
what you've come up with?

7
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,324
- Which tape is the strongest?

8
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:24,070
- Which tape is the strongest, okay.

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,334
Now see that's good because
you don't like... We were

10
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,214
discussing earlier you don't wanna say

11
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:30,675
which tape is the best,
because you really don't know

12
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:31,859
what does the best mean?

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,319
Strongest, stickiest, longest
lasting but I like it,

14
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,607
which one's the strongest?

15
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:39,376
Do you ladies have any ideas?

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,243
- I said it was Scotch.

17
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:45,402
Well we were gonna hang
the same amount of tape

18
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:47,654
up the edge of the table and stick a

19
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:50,475
marble to the other side
and see how long it holds

20
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,063
the marble for and that's
how you can determine

21
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,862
which one is the strongest.

22
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:56,524
- [Voiceover] Okay so y'all have marbles?

23
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,315
- I have.

24
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:58,798
- You got some marbles, that sounds fine.

25
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:01,643
So you're gonna do a sort of a time test,

26
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:03,349
which one can last longest okay.

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,505
That might work.

28
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,130
You might wanna do a
little test run tomorrow

29
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,359
because if it's something
where their gonna sit there,

30
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,379
the tape's gonna sit there
with a marble on it for

31
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,782
45 minutes, you may not
be able to get that done.

32
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,948
So you might wanna think
about maybe adding marbles

33
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,238
to see which one can hold the most or

34
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:22,781
do something to the tape
to make it drop the marble.

35
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,301
I don't know what that might be.

36
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,426
We're gonna come up with
some more creative ideas.

37
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:28,462
- I was gonna maybe cut like,

38
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:32,443
like this tape is cut halfway into it,

39
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,986
to see how long it will
hold with the marble on it.

40
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:36,762
- [Voiceover] Oh, once it's been cut.

41
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:37,563
- Yeah.

42
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:39,350
- That would be good, okay.

43
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,162
But, and again you have
to make sure that you

44
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:43,088
cut each tape the same distance.

45
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,331
You gotta be fair.

46
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:47,512
So what about, give me a
passionate sample hypothesis

47
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:48,510
that y'all came up with.

48
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,634
- If the Scotch tape is the
strongest then the marble

49
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:52,515
will stay on it longer.

50
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:54,453
- [Voiceover] If the Scotch
tape is the strongest,

51
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:56,797
then the marble will stick to it longer.

52
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:02,179
So in your hypothesis you're
mentioning the type of tape,

53
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:05,337
and you're mentioning
what you're measuring.

54
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:06,544
Okay.

55
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:09,086
- I'm having trouble
finding the group control

56
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,641
experimental manipulator.

57
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,587
- Okay, remember think
about your variables

58
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,246
think about the,

59
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:19,906
especially for your manipulated
variable what you're

60
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,684
changing between the groups.

61
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:22,984
- [Voiceover] The tape.

62
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,306
- Yeah the types of tape.

63
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:25,223
- I understand.

64
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,477
- Okay, I'll come back and
we'll discuss the other ones.

65
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:31,707
(students talking)

66
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:35,114
- Alright guys, Josh,
- Sir?

67
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,413
- since y'all have already been
working a little bit give me a

68
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,953
sample question, what you're problem is,

69
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,031
the question that you guys came up with.

70
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,791
- Our problem it was, which paper towel

71
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,439
sucks up more water?

72
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,655
- [Voiceover] Okay so you ...
- Absorbs more water.

73
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,359
- Absorbs more water,
or sucks up that's fine.

74
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,598
We're just nice and simple,
it means the same thing.

75
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:59,221
So you guys are going
straight for absorbency?

76
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,418
- [Voiceover] Yes sir.

77
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:02,600
- What about a hypothesis, Darren?

78
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,060
- If Brawny, Bounty and a name
brand paper towel are tested

79
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,419
then Brawny will absorb the most water.

80
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,425
- Nice and simple, nice and simple.

81
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,225
See you mentioned all the different brands

82
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:15,420
right in the beginning and then
you picked one and said

83
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,008
exactly what it would do
better, absorb the most water.

84
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,727
Okay, perfect.

85
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:24,562
Now, have you got any idea how you're
gonna test the absorbency?

86
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,390
Any ideas about your
procedure, what kind of

87
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,491
method are you gonna follow,

88
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,915
to figure out which one
absorbs the most water?

89
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,448
- [Voiceover] (drowned
out by background chatter)

90
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:35,350
We're gonna use water.

91
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,278
- What do you need with water?

92
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:37,618
- Like water, we need water.

93
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,197
- We need water, yeah.  We need water, but

94
00:03:39,197 --> 00:03:40,857
how are you gonna use
the water to test it?

95
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,692
- [Voiceover] First we'll
get a measurement of how much

96
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,758
water we have in a container.

97
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:48,542
And then we'll put the towel
in the container and see how

98
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,435
well it sucks up the water.

99
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:54,266
To see if the level drops and
we'll measure it from there.

100
00:03:54,266 --> 00:03:56,961
- So you're saying put a
known amount of water in

101
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:58,652
some kind of container,
and we've got tons of

102
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:00,043
beakers we can use.

103
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:04,024
Then put the paper towel
in there, take it out.

104
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,731
How long you gonna let it sit in there?

105
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,703
- [Voiceover] Like a minute.

106
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:08,654
- Well, you gotta know.

107
00:04:08,654 --> 00:04:09,577
You gotta come up with the time and it's

108
00:04:09,577 --> 00:04:11,284
gotta be right on.

109
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,363
Cause you don't wanna leave
Bounty in there for 10 seconds

110
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:15,350
but Brawny for 40 seconds. That's not fair.

111
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,253
You've gotta keep it equal.

112
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:17,675
But that's the kind of stuff you've got to

113
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,552
think about. You've got to be detailed.

114
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,193
Alright, and then you're gonna measure what

115
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:23,086
liquid is left in the container?

116
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:23,944
- [Voiceover] Yes.

117
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:25,570
- You can do that.

118
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,066
Yeah, that'll work okay, nice and simple.

119
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,970
So whichever one leaves
the least amount of

120
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,224
water behind should be the
best as far as absorbency.

121
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,273
- [Voiceover] Yes.

122
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:37,783
- Okay.

123
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,312
- [Voiceover] For our procedure
we're trying to think and

124
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,274
like maybe you could put
like three of the same stains

125
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,874
on one sock and then test it without one.

126
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,987
- [Voiceover] You definitely
need to use the same stain.

127
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:01,806
You don't wanna have Zout
going against coffee and

128
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:03,396
Clorox fighting mud.

129
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,287
That's definitely a good idea so,

130
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,598
what kind of stains might you use?

131
00:05:10,998 --> 00:05:12,600
- We'll use,

132
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:15,705
what kind of (inaudible) we got?

133
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,911
- We can use food coloring.

134
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,003
- [Voiceover] Yeah, food coloring.

135
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:20,604
- I actually have some food coloring.

136
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,358
- Or we could use,

137
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:23,681
- [Voiceover] I got some barbecue sauce.

138
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:24,960
- Barbecue sauce?

139
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,554
As long as you do not
eat it during the lab.

140
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:28,801
That's fine, I like that.

141
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:31,728
Because that's more natural, I mean.

142
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:32,644
- [Voiceover] Ketchup.

143
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:34,628
- And that's already measured for you,

144
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:36,509
like in packets that
may not be a bad idea.

145
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,845
- Or mustard.

146
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,791
- Maybe yeah, now if you're
gonna do those kind of liquids

147
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,963
we'll have to find a way to measure it.

148
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:44,658
- [Voiceover] We can use hot sauce.

149
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,342
- Or hot sauce.

150
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:47,944
Okay that works, that is more liquidy

151
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:49,499
that might actually work.

152
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,241
Because we can pour it out we
can use pipes or you can use

153
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,423
pipets or beakers or something
to measure it out so that

154
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,525
each sock gets the same amount.

155
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,198
You don't wanna, again don't
wanna put twice as much

156
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:59,181
hot sauce for this to fight
than this one, that's not fair.

157
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,063
- Yes sir.

158
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,476
Okay, what kind of hypothesis?

159
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:06,764
- Our hypothesis was if
we test all three samples,

160
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:07,522
- Test all three.

161
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:10,285
and then I believe that the

162
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:13,175
Clorox will remove the stain faster.

163
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:15,113
- So you're picking Clorox,
why'd you pick that?

164
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:19,409
- Because the Clorox is sponsored by more,

165
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:24,122
(laughs) by more varieties of

166
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,143
stain removers and they beat...

167
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:28,023
- So in other words you've
seen commercials about it?

168
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:28,778
- Yes sir.

169
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:30,728
- So you're taking what you
know, inferences like we talked about,

170
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:32,725
talking about what you know
and making a prediction.

171
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,427
This one seems familiar,
have you heard of Zout?

172
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:35,100
- No sir.

173
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,355
- Okay most people say they haven't.

174
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,663
I don't know why.
- [Voiceover] I picked

175
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,244
the same one because that's
the only one I'd heard of.

176
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,838
- And the reason why we said...

177
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:43,438
- Instead of using a marble which I

178
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:45,911
forgot at home and we used weights,

179
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,559
but they were way too heavy.

180
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:51,297
So we put a glue stick on a
piece of each tape that was

181
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:54,572
about 10 centimeters long, and we

182
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:57,172
made a cut in it that was
one centimeter because

183
00:06:57,172 --> 00:07:00,411
one half centimeter
was too steep or thick.

184
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,859
And then we recorded it
and we found that the first one that

185
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,123
dropped was this one which was a second,

186
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,805
it didn't hold on at all.

187
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:11,138
And then this one was 17 seconds and then

188
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,237
Scotch proving to be the strongest

189
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:15,966
dropped at 79 seconds.

190
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,918
- [Voiceover] 79 seconds alright cool.

191
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,342
So what does that data
then tell you, Sharonda?

192
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:23,803
You said when you collected it,

193
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:26,844
what are you, looking at what
you found out with your data?

194
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:28,923
What does it prove?

195
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:30,757
- That the Scotch tape is better.

196
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,544
- And it's not even close.

197
00:07:32,544 --> 00:07:35,099
So I like how you guys have
chosen to use a bar graph

198
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,719
because I can just look at it,
I can just look at it and go

199
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:44,424
wow look at that. The bar is up so huge

200
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,437
compared to the other two.

201
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:46,841
Okay so it's very easy to distinguish

202
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,316
which one did the best.

203
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:49,756
Okay.

204
00:07:50,719 --> 00:07:54,120
Did you find maybe, ladies, that
you had any kind of error?

205
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,220
- [Voiceover] Well yeah, the
first time I cut into the tape

206
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,646
I cut too deep like twice.
- Cut too deep?

207
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,548
- Yea, and then we found out the weights

208
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,849
just tore right away.

209
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:05,265
They were way too heavy.

210
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,320
They wouldn't even hold on when I let go.

211
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,026
- [Voiceover] So you're very
careful about making it drop.

212
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:10,419
- Yeah.
- Alright, cool.

213
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:20,960
Okay so what kind of data
are you collecting Mark?

214
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,675
I mean what kind of data are
you guys trying to put together?

215
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,869
- We trying to figure our which one is stronger,

216
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:28,459
which one would last the longest.

217
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,148
- Right now we're seeing
which one lasts the longest for

218
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:31,832
how many times we rinse it.

219
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,388
This is the first time
we're rinsing it and then

220
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,570
we're trying to wipe it up again.

221
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,323
- [Voiceover] Okay and
this is still the...

222
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:37,238
- This is still corn syrup.

223
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,551
- Still the corn syrup. Okay
cool, alright that'll work.

224
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,373
So how are you gonna organize this?

225
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,672
- I'll chart a graph,
and we're gonna see how,

226
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:46,795
which one tears first on which rinse.

227
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:47,956
- [Voiceover] So you're just
going straight up by the

228
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:49,674
numbers, before it rips.

229
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:52,309
Kind of simple so that gives
you, that generates you some

230
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:53,830
numbers to use, okay.

231
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,955
Alright.

232
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:57,115
Michael,

233
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:01,220
did you guys, I know you're
still kind of in the middle of

234
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,019
collecting your data.

235
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,892
Anything you see that can be
done better, something maybe

236
00:09:04,892 --> 00:09:07,377
you made an error with?

237
00:09:07,377 --> 00:09:09,733
Something that seems to not
be working like you expected?

238
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,497
- Dropping this one.

239
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:12,604
- [Voiceover] Okay.

240
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:14,380
- That was one.

241
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,307
- [Voiceover] That was one
alright, anything else?

242
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:18,385
Maybe that you're noticing
with your, anything that you're

243
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:21,206
noticing with your procedure
that you could, to make it?

244
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:24,125
- This guy could help
out a little bit more.

245
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,249
- We could've put this stuff in a little

246
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:29,373
beaker thing, would've made it easier.

247
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,660
- [Voiceover] Put what in the beaker?

248
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,518
- Our solutions and stuff so
we could've put it in there.

249
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:35,898
That way we have an exact measurement.

250
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,337
- [Voiceover] That's true, okay so what,

251
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:39,612
what you're saying is that
your experiment may have some

252
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,180
errors because you don't
really know what's left?

253
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,725
- We got measurments but we
don't have exact measurements.

254
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,504
- [Voiceover] So you think
it would've been better to

255
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,530
do that, if you were to do it
again that's what you might do?

256
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,275
Okay, alright cool.

257
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,936
Carry on.

258
00:09:53,318 --> 00:09:57,201
(background chatter)

259
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:06,109
Okay, hi Jeff and Keosha.

260
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,444
Alright so you're right in the middle of

261
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,314
collecting your data. Do
you have a, have you come up

262
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:10,951
with a data table yet?

263
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:12,831
Designed how you want it to look?

264
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,212
Not yet, how do you think you want to?

265
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:17,428
You gotta make it organized
when you put your data in.

266
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,390
How you gonna write it down?

267
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,729
Any ideas?

268
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,174
- What about a graph?

269
00:10:23,174 --> 00:10:25,277
- Well, you're definitely
gonna have a graph too.

270
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:27,355
But you also need a
data table to record it,

271
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:29,420
now that you're starting
to get some results.

272
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,080
- I don't know to do that, like.

273
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,892
- [Voiceover] Okay well we'll
just think about it then,

274
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:34,274
make something up.

275
00:10:34,274 --> 00:10:35,934
What do you think will be
the easiest way to organize?

276
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,639
Okay let's do this, what
results are you looking for?

277
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,297
- The best thing, stain cleaner.

278
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,538
- [Voiceover] Okay, based
on what, I mean what are you

279
00:10:43,538 --> 00:10:46,254
using as your rule to say
that they clean the best?

280
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:50,677
Color change or?
- Yeah.

281
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:51,483
- Okay.

282
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,522
- How much it took off.

283
00:10:52,522 --> 00:10:54,137
- How much it took off,
how are you gonna measure

284
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,875
how much it took off?

285
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:00,459
- By, by the color.

286
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,647
- [Voiceover] Or do we
need to use something?

287
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,086
- [Voiceover] I don't know,
this is up to you guys.

288
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,991
This is your experiment.

289
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,091
What do you mean by the color?

290
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,552
- Like, how dark it went to light.

291
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:13,132
From darkest to lightest.

292
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,733
- [Voiceover] Okay you do that,
I mean you could compare it

293
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,670
side by side. That's a good
way, like a scale, sure.

294
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,492
You got any other ideas?

295
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:21,385
You could do that.

296
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,287
Alright so let's just
say you went straight up,

297
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,491
we're gonna compare the
original color to the new color.

298
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:30,847
How can you organize
that into a data table?

299
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:33,552
What kind of information would
you need to put in there?

300
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,778
- The color.
- Yeah, the color change.

301
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,497
Okay, so the color changed.

302
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,075
You definitely have to have the brands,

303
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,311
you've gotta know which one did what.

304
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,718
So how are you gonna write
down the color change?

305
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:50,138
How could you organize that into a chart?

306
00:11:58,025 --> 00:11:59,186
- [Voiceover] That's hard.

307
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,062
- [Voiceover] I know, I know.

308
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:06,088
I think you already told me the answer.

309
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:07,364
What would you say you were looking for,

310
00:12:07,364 --> 00:12:09,107
what did you say you were
looking for? The color change?

311
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,351
How were you gonna compare it?

312
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:11,771
- [Voiceover] From darkest to lightest.

313
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,285
- [Voiceover] From
darkest to lightest okay.

314
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,631
So isn't this sorta like before,

315
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,267
and after.

316
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:19,647
So maybe you can have a,
somewhere in your data table

317
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,271
a column or a row where
you're talking about what the

318
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:24,012
color is before, describing it.

319
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,788
So it's gonna be what
kind of data since you're

320
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:26,914
describing it?
- What kind of graph

321
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,609
should we use?

322
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,910
- We'll get to that in a second.

323
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,709
So what kind of data is that
where you're just writing down

324
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,694
like descriptions and colors?

325
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:36,133
That's what we've been working on.

326
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,083
We're not using numbers.

327
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,465
(mumbling)

328
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:41,602
Well, we'll get to the graph in a second.

329
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,516
You know what kind of
data it was where we,

330
00:12:45,126 --> 00:12:48,706
collect descriptions and colors and words?

331
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,977
(chuckles) It's right there.

332
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:53,778
Say it.

333
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:55,097
- It's (laughing).

334
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,421
You've got a (making letter sound).

335
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:57,617
- Quantitative?

336
00:12:57,617 --> 00:12:58,901
- Well that's numbers,
- Qualitative.

337
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,424
- Qualitative, so that's
what you're doing.

338
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:02,502
Now how you gonna put that in a graph?

339
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:05,374
(background chatter)

340
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:07,657
- [Voiceover] From the darker shade to the

341
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:09,270
lighter shade, right?

342
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,593
- [Voiceover] Decide what goes where.

343
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:11,806
- Okay that sounds good to me.

344
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,228
- [Voiceover] What kind of graph?

345
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:14,540
- [Voiceover] I don't know.

346
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,638
If you're trying to
compare and contrast these...

347
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:17,739
- Double bar graph?

348
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:18,545
- Sure.

349
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,428
That would probably work.

350
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:22,814
Okay here so,

351
00:13:22,814 --> 00:13:25,054
you guys have been working
on which paper towel

352
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,097
absorbs the most liquid.

353
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,977
I see y'all have a data table that,

354
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,394
nice and simple.

355
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,298
Record how much water they...

356
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,413
- [Voiceover] Absorb.

357
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,177
- Absorb, how much water they absorb.

358
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:38,091
And what kind of conclusion,
Ms. Goodwin could you

359
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:40,192
draw for your data?

360
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:42,839
- For my data I drew
that Southern Homes had

361
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,834
absorbed the most water.

362
00:13:45,834 --> 00:13:49,572
And then Brawny absorbed
the next, (laughs)

363
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:51,035
absorbed the next most.

364
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:53,356
And then it was, Bounty was the last.

365
00:13:53,356 --> 00:13:55,435
- Bounty came in last, but only barely.

366
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,130
- [Voiceover] Only by one.

367
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,201
- So, Josh.

368
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,666
- [Voiceover] Yes?

369
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,490
- Based on the results
that your group got,

370
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,997
how would you, how would
that change your thinking?

371
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:11,581
In other words, how might that
change your shopping habits,

372
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,845
if you had these to choose from?

373
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:16,028
Well, I would pick
Southern Homes more than

374
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:18,790
any of the other brands
because it absorbs more.

375
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,531
- [Voiceover] And isn't that
what it's supposed to do?

376
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:21,507
- Yeah.
- Okay.

377
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,527
So Darren,

378
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,010
looking back at y'all's
procedure looking back at

379
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,647
your entire lab, is
there anything that maybe

380
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:31,108
if your were to redo
this lab right, is there

381
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:33,122
something you might would
change about it to make it

382
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,793
better or more accurate?

383
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:37,449
- Yes I would use different
measurements of water,

384
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:38,580
like three of them.

385
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,430
- [Voiceover] Three?
- Yes.

386
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:40,707
- You mean like repeated?

387
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,947
Like maybe for each paper
towel do it three times?

388
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:43,934
- Yes.

389
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:46,917
- Okay, alright, that's actually
a pretty good idea because

390
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,670
when you do those extra trials

391
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,714
it helps to eliminate mistakes.

392
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,211
Because you could've found
out with these two being so

393
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,740
close, if you would've had
time to be able to do it

394
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,679
two more times you could
have found that maybe

395
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:59,978
on average Bounty ended up beating Brawny,

396
00:14:59,978 --> 00:15:01,521
or vice versa you never know.

397
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,093
Okay, Mia.

398
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,284
What about,

399
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,178
what about your hypothesis, was it right?

400
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,442
Did you pick the correct one?

401
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:16,740
- No, I picked Brawny.

402
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,949
- Brawny, okay so what kind
of new hypothesis, based on this?

403
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,683
Let's say that you guys came
up with a whole new idea,

404
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:25,889
that was different from
what you did this test.

405
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:27,862
Like another whole procedure
like Darren was saying,

406
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,258
do it multiple times, maybe
it's completely different.

407
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,881
What kind of new
hypothesis would you make,

408
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,564
if you were gonna do a similar experiment

409
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:36,515
with a twist to it?

410
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:39,269
- I would pick Southern Home.

411
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:40,757
- Just because it won this one?

412
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:41,455
- Yeah.

413
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:43,393
- Okay, so based on your results

414
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:45,076
you might choose the same one.

415
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:47,456
Anybody think they would
choose a different one?

416
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:49,395
- [Voiceover] I'd still
stay with the same one.

417
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,324
- Which was which one?
- Brawny.

418
00:15:52,324 --> 00:15:53,928
- Why would you still pick Brawny?

419
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:56,180
- Because it was close
it wasn't, it was like,

420
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,801
it wasn't that close, but if
we would've made like more, if

421
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:04,318
we had tested it more then
it would've probably stayed.

422
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,616
- And so do you think it's possible,

423
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:07,731
- It is possible.

424
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:09,972
- that if you did a
completely different test,

425
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:12,433
than just seeing which one
sucked up water, maybe if you

426
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,232
tested strength,

427
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:15,649
Brawny could have won that one?

428
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:16,949
- Yes.

429
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:18,354
I know it could.

430
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,535
- [Voiceover] Okay, cool.

431
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,612
I like how y'all did the
lab it was nice and simple.

432
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:29,069
And other then Darren's error
did you see anything that,

433
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:31,076
anything else you would do differently?

434
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:32,969
Anything else that you feel that you could

435
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:36,139
have done better other than
just maybe doing it extra times?

436
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,154
- [Voiceover] Test to see like how thick it is.

437
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:39,675
- [Voiceover] Test the
thickness of the paper towel?

438
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:40,168
- Yes.

439
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,194
(mumbling)

440
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:43,234
- [Voiceover] Are you straight?

441
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,975
So in other words have
a second type of test.

442
00:16:44,975 --> 00:16:46,574
Okay, sure.

443
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:48,703
- I'll probably change the
temperature of the water.

444
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,688
- [Voiceover] Change
the temperature of it?

445
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:52,510
- Yeah.
- [Voiceover] Oh, that's true.

446
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,147
So you have to add in different
variables because maybe

447
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,109
one of them works better under
- Heat.

448
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:57,964
- [Voiceover] or lasts better
under higher heat, okay.

449
00:16:57,964 --> 00:17:00,210
Cool, awesome.

450
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:06,612
- [Voiceover] Tim!

451
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:08,962
- It's okay Tim doesn't
have to be over here.

452
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,790
So let's see what kind of chart you have.

453
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,660
Now explain this chart to me Deontay,

454
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,042
because all I'm seeing is check marks.

455
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,178
- I did mine, I just did something simple.

456
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:20,132
- [Voiceover] Okay that's fine.

457
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:22,084
- I put my name right there
and I put if it left a light

458
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,655
stain I left a check mark
and if it left a dark stain,

459
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,649
I meant stain, I put a check mark.

460
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:30,189
- [Voiceover] Okay, so I
see some of y'all are still

461
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:32,975
working on your graphs and
how you wanna display them.  Alright.

462
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:36,737
So why did you choose a bar graph?

463
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:40,382
- So we can do like the
levels of the stains,

464
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:42,634
we got like medium.

465
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:43,848
- [Voiceover] Medium.

466
00:17:43,848 --> 00:17:44,829
- Light and dark.

467
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:46,256
- Let me see.

468
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:48,311
So you saying you're doing,
you're going kind of like

469
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:51,306
a qualitative data, light, medium, dark and

470
00:17:51,306 --> 00:17:53,847
you're just sort of shading up to the

471
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,945
level you think that it had. Okay,
how could you do that better?

472
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:00,381
What might be a more
reliable way to gather data?

473
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:03,272
I mean the color change is okay, I mean

474
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:05,664
the color change is fine
because that's what you're

475
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:07,510
looking for, right? When
you buy a stain remover

476
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,552
you wanna see that it takes the stain out.

477
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:13,047
What might be some more
reliable data you could gather,

478
00:18:13,047 --> 00:18:16,123
if you were to do this
differently, for the future?

479
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:19,473
You need to come up with
a creative way to get

480
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,818
better data or more data maybe?

481
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,746
- The more data we can get
is by looking through the

482
00:18:23,746 --> 00:18:25,788
sock up under the sock to see how dark

483
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,205
the color went through.

484
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:29,944
- Okay, so compare the levels
and how much stain

485
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:31,221
was pushed through the sock?

486
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:31,825
- Yes sir.

487
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,218
- Alright that'll work.

488
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:35,087
What else?

489
00:18:35,087 --> 00:18:37,695
- Or we can tell by if it's
a light, if it's a ring

490
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,307
around a light spot then we can tell if it

491
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:43,987
cleared and if it clears
some color off of it.

492
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:46,367
- So you're talking about
maybe the shape of the stain or...

493
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:48,073
- Yes sir, the shape of the stain.

494
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:49,524
- Okay, possibly.

495
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:51,753
- And if it's a ring around
it like this one right here,

496
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:54,168
if it's a ring around it
it's a light spot and we can tell

497
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,874
it isn't't clean enough.

498
00:18:55,874 --> 00:18:57,709
- [Voiceover] Alright, so how about this?

499
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,035
Whose opinions did you use

500
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,334
to get these scales?

501
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:05,953
- [Voiceover] I used my own for mine.

502
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:06,653
- [Voiceover] Okay.

503
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:10,074
Cause they think that one
was the best and I think

504
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:11,734
this one was the best.

505
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,613
- [Voiceover] So, what
might be, think about this

506
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,376
what might be a better
way, a more reliable way

507
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:19,420
to get more data,

508
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,312
than just your opinions?

509
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,775
- [Voiceover] Ask other people's opinions.

510
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:23,842
- [Voiceover] Ask other people.

511
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:26,037
Again, if you were to redo
it, do you think it would

512
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:27,441
be a better idea to maybe

513
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:29,159
ask some other people?
- [Voiceover] Yes,

514
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,574
Like going around the class
asking what they think?

515
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:32,851
- [Voiceover] Getting a vote.

516
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:34,139
- [Voiceover] Like a vote, like a survey?

517
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,170
- [Voiceover] Yeah a survey.

518
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,105
- [Voiceover] Or a vote, okay.

519
00:19:37,105 --> 00:19:39,404
Alright, last thing.

520
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,632
Now that you've finished it, what kind of

521
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:43,443
problems did you see?

522
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,545
Is there something that
okay, if I did this again,

523
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:48,830
I know we could've had some
error during this point,

524
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,664
like we could've made a mistake here?

525
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:55,099
- We saw that, if we woulda
let the colors and the

526
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:58,732
stain remover sit a little longer, that

527
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,298
it wouldn't have come out.
