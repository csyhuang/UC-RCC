1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,559
- [Student] Like, learning is
supposed to be a privilege,

2
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:03,697
not a burden.

3
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:04,672
It's like...

4
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,088
Supposed to be...

5
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:07,737
Like, that's why we're America.

6
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:10,941
We have the choice, you're not
supposed to be forced to...

7
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:12,298
do it.

8
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:14,281
- [Teacher] Okay.

9
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:15,586
- [Student] Um, but like,

10
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:19,107
about them picking a
random person, they might,

11
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:21,434
they might not just go
pick a random person

12
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:23,640
if they have to vote, because,

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,380
if they have to vote,
then they're gonna go

14
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,516
see that candidate,

15
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:31,372
candidate's political
beliefs are, and what

16
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,340
he or she is gonna do for the country.

17
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,132
- [Teacher] Okay. Trevor?

18
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,083
- [Student] But, if um...

19
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,629
they're not gonna know which one to pick

20
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,928
if they're not educated, or,

21
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:43,455
don't know about the person.

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,263
- [Teacher] Okay.

23
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,045
- [Student] What if they don't know how to read?

24
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,786
In their researching.

25
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:52,132
They don't know how to read.

26
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,407
- [Teacher] Okay.

27
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:56,511
- [Student] Do you want me to say my question?

28
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:57,718
- [Teacher] Yeah, go, ask your question.

29
00:00:57,718 --> 00:00:59,226
- [Student] Okay, um...

30
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:02,308
If only, like, when we don't have...

31
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,628
the law, only 60 percent vote,

32
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:07,764
so, how is that supposed to show

33
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:08,879
what America really wants?

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,899
How is that supposed to
show what president we want,

35
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:12,913
and what choices we wanna do?

36
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,499
- [Student] But, if,

37
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:17,989
we do get the other 40 percent

38
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:19,795
that already don't wanna vote,

39
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:20,938
then they would just pick one,

40
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:22,842
and that still wouldn't be the,

41
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:25,042
the will of the big United States.

42
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,129
- [Student] And outta the 60 percent
votes, you could just make your,

43
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,079
uh, votes outta that.

44
00:01:31,453 --> 00:01:32,451
- [Teacher] What do you mean?

45
00:01:32,451 --> 00:01:34,231
- [Student] Like, the people that did vote,

46
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,968
just, choose a person who
did get the most votes.

47
00:01:36,968 --> 00:01:38,686
- [Student] But we wanna see what

48
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:41,170
America as a whole really wants, not what

49
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,678
a little over half of America wants.

50
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:47,220
- [Student] Um, our founding fathers
vote for the right to vote,

51
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,683
for, for freedom,

52
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:51,673
and so, I think we should use that wisely.

53
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,367
- [Teacher] Okay, elaborate
on that a little bit.

54
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,594
Say that one more time.

55
00:01:56,594 --> 00:02:00,959
- [Student] Um, if our founding 
fathers vote for the right to,

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,304
or fought for the right to freedom,

57
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:06,137
then, I think we should
use that correctly.

58
00:02:06,137 --> 00:02:08,273
- [Teacher] So, you think,
that, if the founding fathers

59
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:10,014
looked at this law, they would say,

60
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:12,127
'this is not what we meant, when we said,

61
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,519
you know, we want people
to vote for our leaders',

62
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,725
they didn't want us to force people,

63
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:18,884
they still wanted it to be a freedom.

64
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:21,152
- [Student] Didn't we like,

65
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:22,150
like,

66
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,451
have the law,

67
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:24,658
for,

68
00:02:24,658 --> 00:02:26,492
like, trying to get the opinion of

69
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:29,575
the whole population of America?

70
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,968
The other 40 percent,

71
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:34,662
it still, wouldn't be like,

72
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:36,380
their decision, because they would just,

73
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,024
pick one, they wouldn't really care.

74
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,010
So, they're not really
getting any difference,

75
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,937
by not having the law.

76
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,634
- [Student] But we're not forcing 
them to do that,

77
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:46,701
we're forcing them

78
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,879
to help America.

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:49,923
- [Student] So, you're forcing them...

80
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:51,438
- [Teacher] Okay. Jackson,

81
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,859
can you respond to that

82
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:53,718
point?

83
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,181
- [Jackson] Um. Yes, if you, like,

84
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:57,154
if we don't force people to vote,

85
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:58,687
then, maybe the poor,

86
00:02:58,687 --> 00:03:00,405
just can't make it there.

87
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,518
And if we say, 'oh, you have to vote',

88
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:03,609
then we,

89
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,559
then we could like
provide them transporation

90
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,790
to get to there.

91
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,253
Also,

92
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:10,551
if poor people won't vote,

93
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,154
that means rich people will vote,

94
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:13,524
and they'll just...

95
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:15,311
vote for the person

96
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,958
who they believe is gonna keep them rich,

97
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,025
and that they'd not go against that.

98
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,163
- [Teacher] Do you think that that

99
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:22,788
represents the majority of Americans,

100
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:24,227
if only those, wealthy,

101
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:27,037
or, at least, middle to upper
class people are voting?

102
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:29,496
- [Jackson] No.

103
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:29,948
- [Teacher] No.

104
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,177
- [Jackson] Because if the poor people don't vote,

105
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:34,081
they're already poor,
that's already bad enough,

106
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,403
and they don't get to
voice their opinion, and

107
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:39,259
in a democracy, too.

108
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,170
That's just even worse.

109
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,445
- [Teacher] And that's a big
segment of people, right?

110
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:44,303
So, you're saying that,

111
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:45,580
really,

112
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,460
a lot of these people, maybe it's that

113
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,388
it's not that they don't want to vote,

114
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:50,827
it's that they don't have the opportunity,

115
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:52,638
we need to provide some more...

116
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:54,426
public, um,

117
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:55,448
opportunities, like,

118
00:03:55,448 --> 00:03:57,050
opportunities like public transportation

119
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,257
to allow them to vote,

120
00:03:58,257 --> 00:03:59,534
to make it easier.

121
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:00,692
Okay?

122
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:01,853
- [Student] 'Cause it's,

123
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:02,990
not only

124
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,523
poor and uneducated people,

125
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,147
it's just people that
really don't care that much,

126
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,470
and like,

127
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,560
when making

128
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,557
those people vote,

129
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:14,646
like kind of what she said, they could...

130
00:04:14,646 --> 00:04:17,177
most, a lot of 'em could
try and break the law,

131
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:18,733
if you force them to vote.

132
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,196
Because they just don't want to

133
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:21,450
and they really don't care,

134
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,353
and like, if there's somebody who has...

135
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,954
who doesn't care but,
they're being forced to vote,

136
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:28,021
and they have a really busy job,

137
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:29,623
and they have a lot going on,

138
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:32,130
they wouldn't have time
to research, or anything,

139
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,088
and so they could,

140
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,528
they would just have to go out there

141
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,525
when they did have to vote,
they'd just vote for someone,

142
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:38,405
'cause they never had any time to

143
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,634
do any research or look
at something about the...

144
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,469
people to vote for.

145
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:43,746
- [Teacher] Okay, let's
come back to that point,

146
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,510
'cause I think we still
have some questioners,

147
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,593
who haven't...

148
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:47,261
asked their question,

149
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:48,468
who's, who's up next?

150
00:04:51,068 --> 00:04:52,095
Jaylen?

151
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:54,009
- [Jaylen] Um...

152
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,447
you say there are, different ways to...

153
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,328
give them their complete and to vote,

154
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:00,743
but, what are those ways?

155
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:01,903
- [Student] What'd she say?

156
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:04,094
(Chuckling)

157
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:06,358
- [Student] Well, if you have, things...

158
00:05:06,358 --> 00:05:07,518
- [Teacher] Hold on. Let me,

159
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:09,330
let me make sure they
heard what you're saying.

160
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,164
Say it again, but say it louder.

161
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:12,959
- [Jaylen] Okay. Um...

162
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,137
(Chuckling)

163
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,524
I say, it's different
ways, to get them to vote,

164
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,847
but what are those ways,

165
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:19,742
that you get them to vote?

166
00:05:20,816 --> 00:05:23,834
- [Teacher] Does anybody have
a ready response for that?

167
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,018
- [Student] I can't hear her.

168
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:26,179
- [Teacher] She's saying,

169
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:28,292
you guys are saying there are better ways

170
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,848
than compulsory voting laws,

171
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,195
there's other and better ways, so,

172
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:33,263
what are those ways?

173
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:34,952
- [Student] Like,

174
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,042
just because they're poor,

175
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,782
doesn't mean they can't know that like,

176
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:40,966
you can like,

177
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:44,193
hang up posters, or like,

178
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,422
get someone to hand out
flyers or something.

179
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:48,512
It doesn't have to be all electronic.

180
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:49,609
- [Jaylen] I'm not talking about poor people.

181
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:50,447
(Chuckling)

182
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:51,521
- [Teacher] Well, she's saying...

183
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,917
- [Student] It could help anybody, really, but...

184
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,055
- [Teacher] Okay. Respond...

185
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:55,448
- [Student] Well, but there are poor
people that wanna vote,

186
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,515
they don't have a chance to.

187
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:57,261
- [Student] Excuse me?

188
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:57,704
(Chuckling)

189
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,074
- [Teacher] Well, hold
on, hold on a second.

190
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:00,908
Hold on, hold on,

191
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:02,557
'cause I, I'm not sure that y'all are

192
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:04,275
understand what her point is.

193
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,715
Say your point again.

194
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:08,146
- [Jaylen] Um...

195
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:09,016
- [Teacher] With some passion.

196
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,376
- [Jaylen] With passion?

197
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:13,847
(Chuckling)

198
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:15,286
- [Teacher] 'Cause
that'll make your point.

199
00:06:15,286 --> 00:06:16,470
- [Student] Just scream at her.

200
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,189
- [Jaylen] WHAT are different WAYS that

201
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,558
(Chuckling)

202
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:20,583
you can get the American people to vote?

203
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,721
- [Teacher] Besides.

204
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:24,472
- [Jaylen] Besides posters, because
a poster's not gonna...

205
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:25,865
- [Student] It's compulsory voting.

206
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:26,957
- [Teacher] And besides these laws,

207
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:29,070
what are some better
ways to make people vote?

208
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,500
- [Student] Well y'all keep sayin' go and like,

209
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,008
pick up people, and
providing transportation,

210
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,121
well instead of doing
that to make them vote,

211
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:37,561
you might as well just
do that so that they

212
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:38,768
might have the opportunity to vote

213
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,486
rather than having to vote.

214
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:41,438
- [Teacher] So you don't
necessarily have to

215
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:42,854
have these laws,

216
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:44,875
to still provide some public services

217
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,291
to encourage people to vote.

218
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,405
Okay.

219
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,427
- [Student] And like,

220
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,774
we all know that we get those like,

221
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:51,608
very long phone calls that are like,

222
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,303
vote for this person because,

223
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,346
they're gonna do all this stuff,

224
00:06:55,346 --> 00:06:57,599
and like, that then, like,

225
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,340
someone who gets that phone call could

226
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,639
actually think about it, and then like,

227
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,241
'maybe I should vote for that person',

228
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,843
and you see the big...

229
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,970
billboard thingies that have the

230
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,078
big names on it, and all
the signs in the yards,

231
00:07:11,078 --> 00:07:12,655
and so, that could make you think,

232
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,112
'well, maybe I should go vote,

233
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,087
since...

234
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:16,898
all these people are saying we should

235
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:18,082
vote for that person.

236
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:18,589
- [Teacher] So you,

237
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:20,709
you think they should
have an increase in...

238
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,641
in publicizing elections, we should,

239
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,986
we should have more advertising

240
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:29,401
when elections come up? Okay.

241
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,401
Okay, (Backgrond Chatter)

242
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,653
- [Student] Well, if you were to like, have

243
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:35,761
election... (Background chatter)

244
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:37,200
um...

245
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
that would like, cost a lot of money,

246
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,613
to have like a lot of, um...

247
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:42,958
transportation going around.

248
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,002
So, um, and it's like,

249
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,534
not a lot of people are gonna use that

250
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:47,463
transportation,

251
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:48,972
then why, just like,

252
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,969
(Background Chatter)

253
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,662
so, why not just make them vote, cause,

254
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,682
they already have public
transportation out there.

255
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:56,611
- [Teacher] Okay.

256
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,260
Let's top on that one,
we'll come back to it,

257
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,024
because we've got one more question.

258
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,807
- [Student] Uh, if we didn't 
require people to vote,

259
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,827
what would happen if...

260
00:08:04,827 --> 00:08:06,615
what would happen if like, nobody voted...

261
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:08,240
decided to vote?

262
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,443
- [Teacher] Say that one more time.

263
00:08:10,443 --> 00:08:12,138
- [Student] If we didn't require people to vote,

264
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:12,997
what would happen if like,

265
00:08:12,997 --> 00:08:14,669
nobody decided to vote?

266
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,728
- [Student] Or a small majority of people.

267
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:17,996
- [Teacher] Okay.

268
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,500
- [Student] Well, people have
different opinions, like,

269
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,963
some people think that we

270
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:24,634
put a voice out into the government,

271
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,515
and say what we want,

272
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,512
and then, some people think, like,

273
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:30,323
that, we...

274
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:33,616
that every vote counts.

275
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:34,870
And...

276
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,365
basically, there's...

277
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:37,424
like, five...

278
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:39,387
three million people in America,

279
00:08:39,387 --> 00:08:41,361
and I don't think every single one of them

280
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:42,684
would not vote.

281
00:08:44,484 --> 00:08:45,420
- [Teacher] Okay.

282
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,650
Any other responses?

283
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,576
- But we already have 60 percent voting.

284
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:51,201
I mean...

285
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,966
and, so...

286
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:53,848
we know every,

287
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:55,984
some--people are going to vote.

288
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:57,447
It's just the people who...

289
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,282
don't care about politics,

290
00:08:59,282 --> 00:09:00,559
and,

291
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,882
just, like,

292
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:03,600
when we had the survey,

293
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,527
people, a lot of people didn't vote

294
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,520
for the midterm election.

295
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,084
But, on the other hand,

296
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:10,594
some people did.

297
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:11,741
We're always gonna have a group

298
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:13,227
that doesn't vote, and a group that

299
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:16,245
is voting, and if you make them vote

300
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:17,940
they're not gonna care.

301
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,496
Even, as more,

302
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:21,235
as they did when they weren't voting.

303
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:22,795
- [Teacher] Okay,

304
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,805
I'm gonna go ahead and open up the floor,

305
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,709
because we've asked all the questions, so,

306
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,984
pretty much anybody can answer or ask,

307
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:30,842
but let's try and keep
it on the same topic,

308
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,305
so, if you are raising your hand,

309
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,814
make sure you're responding to what the

310
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:35,254
last person said.

311
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:36,995
Okay?

312
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:38,760
Uh, let's see. Connor.

313
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,708
- [Student] Oh, like you said, every
vote counts, but like,

314
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,634
we need more people to vote so we know

315
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,259
that, like,

316
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,792
we know the exact number,

317
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,046
of like,

318
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,671
who is going to be

319
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:52,134
the president, or,

320
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,086
in the

321
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,781
House of Representatives,

322
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:56,011
or the Senate.

323
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,497
So that theres a better chance

324
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,401
that they will get elected.

325
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,584
- [Teacher] Okay, so,
we need a more accurate

326
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,836
portrayal of what people think.

327
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,904
We need more people to vote

328
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,948
so we really know what Americans think.

329
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:07,830
Okay.

330
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,269
- [Student] Well, I agree with Connor, but,

331
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:10,918
going back to what

332
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,938
everybody over there is saying,

333
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:14,331
they're all saying,

334
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:15,794
'oh, they, they won't care,

335
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:16,839
they wont,

336
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,232
they wont care or anything and,

337
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,577
they wont pay attention
to what happens', but,

338
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,110
I mean, if we can...

339
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,222
make like...

340
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:25,871
some kind of exception for like,

341
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:27,636
special needs people,

342
00:10:27,636 --> 00:10:29,609
for the deaf and blind and...

343
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,252
then um...

344
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:34,388
also, we can get people to stand out

345
00:10:34,388 --> 00:10:36,130
in front of a booth,

346
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,755
and once they'll go,

347
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,423
130 people,

348
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,630
get there,

349
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,372
you can do a speech about...

350
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:44,136
both candidates,

351
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:46,760
and their ups and downs.

352
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,789
- [Teacher] Okay, so you're
saying actually have,

353
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,158
people at the voting polls

354
00:10:51,158 --> 00:10:54,664
that are kind of breaking
down the two sides.

355
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,707
Maybe for those people
who didn't take the time

356
00:10:56,707 --> 00:10:57,845
to research it.

357
00:10:57,845 --> 00:10:59,424
Okay.

358
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:01,490
- [Student] Um, one of y'all keep sayin',

359
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,091
we keep sayin' that they might not care,

360
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,157
but like, in actuality,

361
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:07,639
if you, if someone doesn't care,

362
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,636
and you force them to care,

363
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,750
not only is that kinda like,

364
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,738
convincing, like, brainwashing them,

365
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,506
it's also,

366
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,247
if you force someone to do something,

367
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:17,290
they're not going to want to anymore.

368
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,939
So that wouldn't be helping anything.

369
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:20,030
- [Teacher] So you're saying it's,

370
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,074
it's gonna actually make them more bitter,

371
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:23,699
toward voting,

372
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:24,953
if you force them to do it.

373
00:11:24,953 --> 00:11:26,021
Okay.

374
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,669
- [Student] And, someone said that

375
00:11:27,669 --> 00:11:29,457
it's gonna be for the good of the country,

376
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,199
for making them vote,

377
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,196
but, if they could choose a bad,

378
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:34,542
a bad person,

379
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,610
'cause,

380
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,352
it wouldn't be for the
good of the country then.

381
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:38,791
- [Teacher] Okay, so if
you force them to vote,

382
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,206
and then they go and
vote for a bad person,

383
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:42,344
that's not gonna be

384
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:43,830
helping the country at all.

385
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,991
Okay. Jason.

386
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,546
- [Student] Um, like, um,

387
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:48,195
you could, um,

388
00:11:48,195 --> 00:11:50,888
for those people that can't vote,

389
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,142
or um,

390
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:53,210
you could...

391
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,162
put the...

392
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,416
they could put the polls,

393
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,413
the voting polls near...

394
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,015
where those people,

395
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,617
uh, live,

396
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:01,964
and um,

397
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:03,496
so that, they could like,

398
00:12:03,496 --> 00:12:05,841
if they can't drive there in a car,

399
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,281
they could just walk there,

400
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:08,721
because it'd only be like,

401
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:11,623
maybe a block down their way.

402
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:12,877
- [Teacher] Okay.

403
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:14,293
- [Student] You could like, open
a public train, like,

404
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,638
so they don't have to pay to go as much.

405
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:17,799
- [Teacher] And then make it free?

406
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,445
- [Student] Yeah.

407
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,220
- [Teacher] For that day? Okay.

408
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,335
Alexandra, what do you think?

409
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,481
- [Student] Alright, um, well like,

410
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:25,011
making people vote is gonna
make them more interested

411
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,381
in like, the country,

412
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,890
and then they'll actually care,

413
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,074
'cause like, they're not gonna wanna like,

414
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,119
break a law,

415
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,371
and so then they're gonna actually care

416
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:33,764
about the country,

417
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,295
and so they won't just be
choosing a random person,

418
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:38,199
they're gonna actually start caring and,

419
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,312
start thinking about
who they should choose.

420
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,891
- [Teacher] You really think if,

421
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:43,865
if we force them to vote, then they,

422
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:47,580
they will become more
interested in politics

423
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,252
and they'll go out and research it. Okay.

424
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:52,368
- [Student] Like, just like,

425
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:53,436
if you make some,

426
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,039
make everyone vote,

427
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,709
then it's really not gonna
change their opinion,

428
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,543
they're still gonna have...

429
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,395
like, they're still gonna...

430
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:05,483
not really care as much as the person that

431
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,992
would go out and vote

432
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:08,594
without being forced.

433
00:13:08,594 --> 00:13:11,590
So you're really not
getting an accurate...

434
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,540
number of what they think they want,

435
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,956
because they still...

436
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,582
just because you're making them vote

437
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,068
doesn't mean they're gonna...

438
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,526
necessarily pick the right person.

439
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:23,696
- [Teacher] Okay.

440
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:26,270
- [Student] Um, they're always saying like that,

441
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,710
60 percent vote, but,

442
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,869
we still have this 40
percent that haven't voted,

443
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:32,118
well, everyone, like even the poor people

444
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:34,997
and the uneducated,
well everyone knows that

445
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:36,375
there's a presidential election,

446
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,581
or some kind of election going on,

447
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:40,160
you can't, it's like,

448
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,902
impossible to not know about it,

449
00:13:41,902 --> 00:13:44,177
and so really, it's their choice...

450
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,592
that they didn't vote,

451
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,199
most of the people who
aren't poor but they're like

452
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,620
middle class (mumble) like,

453
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,633
they won't make the choice to vote, if...

454
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,832
- [Teacher] Okay. So you're,

455
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,534
- [Student] A lot of people have
made the choice to vote.

456
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:58,373
- [Teacher] So you're saying,

457
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,440
the presidential election,
everybody knows about it,

458
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,065
everybody probably has an opinion

459
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,342
because it's all over the place, so,

460
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,432
60 percent of people are voting,

461
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,639
and 40 percent are not,

462
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,776
obviously those 40 percent know

463
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:10,192
that they don't wanna go and vote.

464
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,539
- [Student] They've chosen not to vote.

465
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:13,605
Most of them have chosen not to vote.

466
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:14,848
- [Teacher] Okay.

467
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:17,073
- [Student] You know, I have to disagree with you,

468
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:20,719
when you say that if we
just tell people to vote,

469
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,157
they'll just pick a random person.

470
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:24,801
What I think is that,

471
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:27,471
if people are being told to vote,

472
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:28,656
they'll just go in there and say,

473
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:30,118
'well, if I'm being told to vote,

474
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,719
I just might as well
just pick someone good'.

475
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,268
You'd think that they would
actually try and think

476
00:14:36,268 --> 00:14:38,288
about something before they vote,

477
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:40,602
like the term 'look before you leap'.

478
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:41,461
- [Teacher] So you think,

479
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,086
if they have to go to
the effort of voting,

480
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,329
they're at least gonna think about it.

481
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,302
They're at least gonna
form an opinion. Okay.

482
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:47,892
- [Student] Um,

483
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,028
like, you put, of, um,

484
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:52,641
you (mumbles)

485
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,659
you could like, make the offices,

486
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,330
make the person take the day off,

487
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,094
and like,

488
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:01,801
sort of give them the day off.

489
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,699
- [Teacher] And that's...
