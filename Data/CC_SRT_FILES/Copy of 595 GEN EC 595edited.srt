1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:10,940
(crosstalk)

2
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:13,340
- You're not doing your job.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:25,340
(crosstalk)

4
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:28,807
Follow the arrow.

5
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:33,807
(crosstalk)

6
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:35,891
Good.

7
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:39,934
(crosstalk)

8
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,776
Just a little bit.

9
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:45,015
Why? Why do we say the wiffle (crosstalk)?

10
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:48,350
- Because it (mumbles).

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,010
- Because nothing in it. It's holes.

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,193
Then is it the holes

13
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:53,132
and nothing in it makes it heavy or light?

14
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,385
- Light.
- Light. Good.

15
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:57,290
- Next, what do we have to do?

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,485
We have all our arrows down. Good.

17
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:02,193
Exactly.

18
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,425
Okay.

19
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,192
(crosstalk)

20
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:08,705
Thank you. Someone
needs to hold this here.

21
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,665
(crosstalk) I have a job
for you. Come hold the clip.

22
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,126
Hold this here.

23
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:15,066
Hold this here.

24
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,088
Come around here.

25
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:18,192
Come here sweetie. Right here.

26
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:18,947
Hold this.

27
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:21,350
(crosstalk)

28
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,904
Okay, now let's count.

29
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:28,904
Go to there and I'll help (crosstalk).

30
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:33,345
(crosstalk)

31
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:40,951
Okay. Good.

32
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,207
Good boy.

33
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,389
- Oh, no.

34
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:45,829
- Uh, oh.

35
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:56,829
(crosstalk)

36
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,456
- Put it in the basket.

37
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,791
Put it in the basket.

38
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:06,980
Good.

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,980
(crosstalk)

40
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:14,196
You have to help her count.

41
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:19,196
(crosstalk)

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,342
I need to hear you.

43
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:25,758
10

44
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,465
20

45
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,802
Should I could count 30?

46
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:30,382
- No.

47
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:31,915
- No. It's not far (crosstalk).

48
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:36,915
(crosstalk)

49
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,464
When this is 20.

50
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:46,814
- 21

51
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,118
22

52
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:51,653
23

53
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:53,405
24

54
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:55,246
25

55
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,022
26

56
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,869
27

57
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,563
28

58
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,572
- Good.

59
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:06,572
(crosstalk)

60
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,129
Is that more than the wiffle ball?

61
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,875
This one? More than this?

62
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,981
Is this one more?

63
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:13,875
Sebastian?

64
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:14,933
Yes.

65
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,615
Good.

66
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:28,615
(crosstalk)

67
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:35,408
Good. 52. Write your 52 down.

68
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,184
(crosstalk)

69
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,285
What's the problem?

70
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,527
What?

71
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,106
What have you done here?

72
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:46,846
(crosstalk)

73
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,059
Okay.

74
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,613
I see (crosstalk) working on her turn.

75
00:03:55,613 --> 00:03:57,355
She hasn't done anything?

76
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,433
Because we're not helping?

77
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,153
What?

78
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,313
Which one did you roll?

79
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:06,313
(crosstalk)

80
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,403
You don't need this (crosstalk).

81
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:11,809
You're not to this point yet.

82
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,352
First you're doing the rolling.

83
00:04:16,313 --> 00:04:17,201
Okay.

84
00:04:19,992 --> 00:04:22,088
You need to move to the side.

85
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:27,088
(crosstalk)

86
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:34,904
Now, help her.

87
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:39,904
(crosstalk)

88
00:04:45,144 --> 00:04:46,229
Okay.

89
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:48,319
Good.

90
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,948
Wait, wait, wait. Oh, okay.

91
00:04:57,948 --> 00:05:06,948
(crosstalk)

92
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,457
Good.

93
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:13,644
Now, it's (crosstalk) turn.

94
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:28,644
(crosstalk)

95
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:30,444
Okay, now.

96
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:32,603
You help her by holding the end.

97
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:37,603
(crosstalk)

98
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,252
No, it's fine. I can tell what it is.

99
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:43,719
You're doing a good job.

100
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:46,464
Someone needs to hold this end.

101
00:05:46,464 --> 00:05:48,251
(crosstalk) right here.

102
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,278
Hold the end right here.

103
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,339
Okay, now. Perfect.

104
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,644
Now, we have to help her count.

105
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:58,937
So she can write her numbers down.

106
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:03,062
Okay, start with the
first one, the wiffle ball.

107
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,663
How far is the wiffle ball?

108
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:09,663
(crosstalk)

109
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:12,827
Starting 10 here? Is this 10?

110
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,557
Where's the 10? Good.

111
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,924
10

112
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:19,714
You think that's how far it is?

113
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,420
Okay, so write that down.

114
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,866
Put in wiffle ball.

115
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:25,083
- [Voiceover] I said I'm next.

116
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:28,722
I said I'm next.

117
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,522
- I'm looking now at (crosstalk).

118
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:33,865
(crosstalk) asked about yours.

119
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:36,871
I think you have your
numbers in the wrong spot.

120
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:38,323
Which went further?

121
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:41,642
Wiffle ball? Which one?

122
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,709
Which one went far?

123
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,022
The baseball, okay.

124
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:48,086
Because I think on our list, you
have them written backwards.

125
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:51,227
We'll fix them. We'll find
them with the right picture.

126
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:56,227
(crosstalk)

127
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:00,195
Okay, let's see what the problem is.

128
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:05,977
The one's got to go on this side.

129
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:11,369
Please help her count
where the baseball is.

130
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,611
Count with her.

131
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,271
10

132
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,230
- 14

133
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,338
15

134
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,486
16

135
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:21,463
17

136
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:22,595
18

137
00:07:22,595 --> 00:07:23,593
19

138
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:24,827
20

139
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:25,570
21

140
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,556
22

141
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:31,394
(mumbles)

142
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,349
- Is there a faster way
we could've done that?

143
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,055
By doing what?

144
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:40,949
By doing what?

145
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,735
Exactly, by counting by 10s.

146
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,754
We could've started here and gone

147
00:07:45,754 --> 00:07:48,344
10,

148
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,842
- 20
- 20

149
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:51,129
and then count (crosstalk) from there.

150
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,348
You're right.

151
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,068
Good.

152
00:07:57,585 --> 00:07:59,325
So, who's next?

153
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:00,371
Steven.

154
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:10,371
(crosstalk)

155
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:16,738
Now what's going on here?

156
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,330
Sarah was saying something (crosstalk).

157
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,886
What's happening?

158
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:26,765
(crosstalk)

159
00:08:26,765 --> 00:08:31,765
No, remember, you did this (crosstalk).

160
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,512
(crosstalk)

161
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:34,684
Together, count them.

162
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:36,473
- 20

163
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:41,473
(crosstalk)

164
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:47,091
Well, let's look.

165
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:50,716
(crosstalk)

166
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:53,959
It does look like (crosstalk).

167
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:56,955
1

168
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,116
2

169
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,706
- 3.
- Yes. Good.

170
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:12,706
(crosstalk)

171
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:15,977
Write it on the board.

172
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:27,964
(crosstalk)

173
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:34,397
But you two can start (crosstalk).

174
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:46,068
And then you two can start.

175
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:50,830
You hold the (crosstalk).

176
00:09:50,830 --> 00:10:05,830
(crosstalk)

177
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,646
Good.

178
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:11,634
Mark it. Good.

179
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:16,634
(crosstalk)

180
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,882
Where does the ball go?

181
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:25,312
Put it in the basket.

182
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:30,312
(crosstalk)

183
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,940
Excellent.

184
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,937
Help the boys now.

185
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,101
You can hold the ramp. It
looks like it's about to fall.

186
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:43,079
Too late (laughter).

187
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:47,003
Wait, wait.

188
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,170
All the things to say.

189
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,170
(crosstalk)

190
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,724
Now with the rubber ball. Exactly.

191
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:11,411
(crosstalk)

192
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:12,909
This one's called the what? Wiff-?

193
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,488
- Wiffle ball.
- Wiffle ball.

194
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:29,488
(crosstalk)

195
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:41,403
What happened with the balls?

196
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:45,926
(crosstalk)

197
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,278
Hold it.

198
00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:50,668
Let me look at yours.

199
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,096
You got yours done?

200
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:53,920
What happened with yours?

201
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,594
What happened with the baseball?

202
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,347
- It went (mumbles).

203
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,242
- Which one went the farthest?

204
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:06,818
- This one.

205
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:08,612
- How about yours?

206
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:11,351
Which one of yours went the farthest?

207
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,637
Yeah, the baseball.

208
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,611
Remember, we talked about that.

209
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:20,611
(crosstalk)

210
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,476
The ball should be in the basket,

211
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:27,928
so it doesn't go under the chair.

212
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:32,928
(crosstalk)

213
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:40,042
- (crosstalk) counting. What happened?

214
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:43,512
No, but what happened here?

215
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,731
Someone has to hold it, you're right.

216
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,687
Can you hold it? Good.

217
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,428
That's better.

218
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:55,295
- 30

219
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,634
40

220
00:12:57,634 --> 00:12:59,051
50

221
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,386
60

222
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:00,996
70

223
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,337
- This is 50.

224
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:04,635
- 50

225
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:05,981
51

226
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:06,840
52

227
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,718
53, 54, 55

228
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:12,695
(crosstalk) start again.

229
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,047
(crosstalk) each one.

230
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,428
50.

231
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,462
- 51

232
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:18,600
52

233
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,748
53

234
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:20,828
54

235
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:21,978
55

236
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:23,295
56

237
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:29,850
- Pablo.

238
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:32,583
Which one of the balls went furthest?

239
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,896
(crosstalk)

240
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,358
The baseball?

241
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,053
What did we talk about when we said

242
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:40,883
at the beginning?

243
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:43,042
Which ball did we think was
going to go the farthest?

244
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:45,091
The baseball.

245
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,995
Why did you think it was
going to go furthest?

246
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:48,574
- Because (crosstalk).

247
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,488
(crosstalk) right?

248
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:51,935
- Yes.

249
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,036
- How about yours? And, Sarah's too?

250
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:56,497
Did the baseball go the farthest?

251
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:58,657
(crosstalk)

252
00:13:58,657 --> 00:13:59,655
That far?

253
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:03,474
(crosstalk)

254
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:05,621
That was a hard push, exactly.

255
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:09,999
(crosstalk)

256
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:11,764
That was a soft and that was a soft.

257
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,481
Which one was the softest?

258
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,457
- Two.

259
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:16,441
- Which one was a really soft push?

260
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,448
The wiffle ball.

261
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:22,071
Why? Why did we say that?

262
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:25,495
- Because, the ball (crosstalk).

263
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,772
- Just a little bit.

264
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:29,094
What happened when you weighed the ball?
When you put them in the balance?

265
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:33,090
- The baseball get's heavier.

266
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,123
- The baseball was heavier.

267
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:39,064
Baseball needed nine
magnet weights, you're right.

268
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,445
You remember.

269
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,495
It was heavy. Good.

270
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,573
(crosstalk) you're absolutely right.

271
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:49,573
(crosstalk)

272
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,334
Okay, help him count to his wiffle ball.

273
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,302
Hold the end.
