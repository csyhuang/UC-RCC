1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
- ...boys and girls, for the last week,
we have been looking at videos about Dr.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,630
Martin Luther King. We've been reading
books about Dr. Martin Luther King to get

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:19,070
a feel for who he was, why people loved
him so much, why laws were changed because

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,320
of things that he said and things that he
did.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,210
So, today, we are going to watch another
clip of Dr. Martin Luther King. This is

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,360
probably one of the most famous speeches
he ever gave. It was his "I Have a Dream"

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,490
speech. I don't want you to so much listen
to his words today as I want you to think

8
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:46,840
about what else he does as he speaks or
while he's speaking that makes him such a

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:53,200
great speaker. How does he capture his
audience? How does he get people to want

10
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,020
to listen to him?
Alright. So, I want you to pay close

11
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,470
attention. It's just a short clip. Then
you'll turn to your partners. So, let's

12
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,716
see... Let me go ahead and get this
started.

13
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:16,474
- [Martin Luther King Video] I have a
dream that one day, down in Alabama with

14
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:23,150
its vicious racists, with its governor
having his lips dripping with the words of

15
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:28,630
"interposition" and "nullification," one
day right there in Alabama little black

16
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,420
boys and black girls will be able to join
hands with little white boys and white

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,084
girls as sisters and brothers. I have a
dream today.

18
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:49,420
I have a dream that one day every valley
shall be exalted, and every hill and

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
mountain shall be made low, the rough
places will be made plain, and the crooked

20
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,250
places will be made straight and the glory
of the Lord shall be revealed and all

21
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,920
flesh shall see it together.
This is our hope. This is our hope and

22
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,670
this is the faith that I go back to the
South with.

23
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,585
With this faith, we will be able to hew
out of the mountain of despair a stone of

24
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:16,440
hope. With this faith, we will
be able to...

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:25,530
- Okay. I'm going to stop it there. And I
want you to tell me first of all, what are

26
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,570
some things that you notice that he did to
capture his audience? I want you to think

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,590
about it for a minute. I see lots of hands
up. What I want you to do is turn to your

28
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,390
share partner first. Talk to your partner
about what you saw.

29
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,543
[cross talk]

30
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:41,880
Okay. Let me have your attention back up
here. I'm going to write Dr. King in the

31
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,440
middle of this web. What I want you all to
do is to tell me what are some things that

32
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,325
you and your partner discussed about what
you saw that made people want to listen

33
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:58,946
and to focus and pay attention to what Dr.
King had to say?

34
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:02,380
Sara?
- He had hand motions.

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,440
- He had hand motions.

36
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,170
- But there was no hand motions in that
clip.

37
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,220
- Yeah, there was.

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,770
- I'm glad that you all saw that. I almost
said something. You could kind of see this

39
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,470
hand go up, but it was so close. The video
was so close. That's why I picked that

40
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,520
particular segment because I saw his arm
and I thought, "Oh, I hope they get that,"

41
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,150
because I couldn't find a better clip.
Zachary?

42
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,320
- The way he said a few words at a time
[inaudible].

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,900
- Okay.
- He said

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,910
[inaudible]
words at a time and stopped...

45
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:47,770
- Very good. He spaced his words, for lack
of something, a better term to use.

46
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,910
Zachary said he would say a few words and
then he would stop so that people could

47
00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:01,761
absorb almost what he was saying and then
he could go on. Annie? Okay. Emma?

48
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:05,500
- He spoke in a very low voice so it was
really easy to hear him.

49
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:12,791
- Okay. So, his tone of voice, right?
We'll put tone of voice. So, it was easy

50
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,952
to hear him.

51
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:23,810
- Yeah. And then he didn't mumble. He
spoke up really loud.

52
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,740
- He spoke loudly. He did not mumble, she
said. He spoke loudly.

53
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,650
- He spoke very serious.

54
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,452
- Yes. He spoke very serious. Jesenya?
- He shook his head.

55
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:41,373
- He shook his head, didn't he? He nodded.
Very good.

56
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,573
- That was my idea.
He shook his head.

57
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:55,723
- Or nodded. Dalen?

58
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,348
- He was looking at the audience.

59
00:05:57,348 --> 00:06:00,880
- Very good.
He was looking at the audience. We call

60
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:08,300
that eye contact. He had notes in front of
him, but he didn't do this, did he?

61
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,000
- No.

62
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,560
- He looked up constantly. He might have
looked down to see where he was in his

63
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,850
speech, but he always looked back at his
audience. Lenare?

64
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,490
- He said nice words that the people knew.

65
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,640
- Okay. The words that he spoke, he had a
good message, didn't he? If you have a

66
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,580
good message, people are willing to listen
to you, too. He was a good, good man. One

67
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,482
more. Kalen?

68
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:38,380
- He even had a gooder life-- a better
life.

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,530
- Very good. And that goes kind of along
with the words that he spoke-- the good

70
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,900
message about having a better life. All
right. So, you guys came up with some

71
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
really good points right here.
What I want you to think about when you do

72
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,410
your readers theater, I want you to think
about how you can incorporate what Dr.

73
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,630
Martin Luther King incorporated into his
speeches to get people to listen to him so

74
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:05,000
that you're believable in your part, that
people can understand what you're saying.

75
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,820
So, what we're going to do is we're going
to create a rubric together that's going

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,455
to help you. So, it's called Rubric For
Speaking Out for Justice: Dr. Martin

77
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:21,936
Luther King Jr., a readers theater play,
grade two because you guys are second

78
00:07:21,936 --> 00:07:27,840
graders.
Now, let's take a look at what I've

79
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,390
written-- listening, speaking viewing.
There's a three, a two and a one. Let's do

80
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:40,452
listening first, okay? Now, if three is
the highest, how do you think you can get

81
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:44,144
a three? Sayid?

82
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,418
- By getting a one plus two?

83
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:50,660
- Okay. But don't think about math right
this moment.

84
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,300
- Oh...

85
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,110
- I want you to think about if I were
grading you, you were grading yourself or

86
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,220
your peers were grading you, how would you
give yourself a three or someone else a

87
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,130
three? Emma?

88
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:07,772
- We start with listening. You wouldn't be
just fumbling through your pages of your

89
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:12,788
book and just traveling around. You'd be
listening to the other people because you

90
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,750
have to know when your part is. You have
to be ready.

91
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,340
- Very good. You have to know where your
part is. Part of doing readers theater is

92
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,400
listening to the people that are reading
before you because that is going to give

93
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,550
you your cue of when it's your turn to
speak, okay? So, "I was a good listener."

94
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:45,688
Let's look at number two. How do you think
you would get a two? How would you score a

95
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:52,375
two for listening? If the best is that you
were a good listener, what would two be?

96
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,350
Annie?

97
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,890
- Looking at your paper and then like
doing something else.

98
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,920
- Looking at your paper but doing
something else. Maybe looking away, maybe

99
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,949
fidgeting. So maybe you tried to listen
most of the time, but you had difficulty

100
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:21,480
with it. So, we could say, "I tried to
listen most of the time."

101
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,910
- Most of the time.

102
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,480
- So, what about a one? Kennedy?

103
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,300
- I didn't listen at all.
- Very good.

104
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,870
- Like purposefully not paying attention.

105
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:43,960
- "I forgot to listen." Yeah, you don't
decide to do that on purpose, Whitney.

106
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,200
Now, the next thing you're going to be
scored on is speaking. So, how could you

107
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,490
get a three for speaking? Sara?

108
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,910
- Don't speak like just normal, like how
the actor would speak.

109
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:08,130
- Speak how the actor would speak. Good.
Lenore? Let's do a body check, please. I

110
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,635
need you all on the carpet.

111
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:15,570
- You're supposed to like listen to what
he said

112
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,388
[inaudible].
- Okay. Annie?

113
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:23,567
- Like speak a little louder. When you
speak loudly, then

114
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,867
[inaudible].

115
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,000
- "I spoke loudly enough for people to
hear."
