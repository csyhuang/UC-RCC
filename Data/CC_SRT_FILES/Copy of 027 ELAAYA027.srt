1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,340
- Exactly. Right. So, what do you all
think about the fact that this is written

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,440
almost sort of journalistically? I know
you're the big newspaper man and

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,860
everything. What do you think about that?

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,070
- That's what I'm talking about. I'm
talking about the growth of the poem

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,610
overall. The first passage, it's almost
not objective, but it kind of states

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,070
what's happening. It doesn't actually say
what the author is thinking. As the poem

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,160
grows and goes on and goes to the next
passages, it becomes more poetic and more

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:34,099
descriptive and it's more of the author's
point of view and the author's stance on

9
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,028
what's happening.

10
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,700
- Nora, what do you think about the poem
so far?

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,663
- I thought it was a good, like,
utilization of the message. I'm taking

12
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,358
African American history this year.

13
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:47,240
- Okay.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:56,990
- We've been talking about the slave trade
the last few weeks. So, that first part,

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,500
we were talking about how they were like
[inaudible],

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,910
the sickness.

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,590
- What are the specific lines that you
think best describe the sickness and the

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,520
death and everything?

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:17,310
- "We have jettisoned the blind to no
avail. It spread. The terrifying sickness

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,600
spreads. It's claws have scratched the
sight from the captain's eyes." The

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,460
slaves were all tied together in their own

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:26,830
[inaudible]

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:33,120
so the sickness and disease could spread
through them. But also, the slavers, like

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,260
the white people on the ship were also
susceptible to disease.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:44,570
- That's where they got the idea of whites
becoming more like the blacks because

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,170
they're in such close quarters that it's
inevitable almost and the fact that they

27
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,490
are holding themselves above them,
superior as civilized, but they're still

28
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,010
acting acts of barbarism is very much a
historical principle.

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,330
- So, you really think that there's a
moment of transformation in this poem

30
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:10,690
where the whites, who are theoretically
the real barbaric people become like the

31
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,510
blacks, who they think are savages.

32
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,340
- I don't think it's even a point of
transformation. I believe that the author,

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,290
Robert Hayden, is talking about this as it
has been. So, this kind of opens in maybe

34
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:32,230
a stress when they're sailing on the slave
ship and they talk about this and it's

35
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,350
like there's all sorts of imagery
throughout this that implies that these

36
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,970
blacks are, er, these whites are becoming
like the blacks.

37
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,130
- What's your favorite line that shows
this, Nick?

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,300
- "Standing to America, bringing home
black gold, black ivory, black seed."

39
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,820
Now, I especially liked the middle part of
that, black ivory. Because ivory is

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,810
usually white.

41
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,709
- Of course. Yes.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,101
- So, you have the juxtaposition of black
and white.

43
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,085
- Yes.

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,540
- I think the lines after that, "Deep in
the festering hold thy father lies, of his

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,940
bones, New England pews are made, those
are altar lights that were his eyes."

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,760
Jordan, what do you think the about this
religious connotation?

47
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,790
- Well, seeing that I'm not too familiar
with the Bible-- Judaism and Christianity

48
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,770
are similar-- but in these two paragraphs
that you were just reading, I saw a big

49
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,560
contrast between the glory of taking back
these animals, these slaves and making the

50
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:35,480
best of them in the new world. Between
that and the evil that they're really

51
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,020
bestowing upon the slaves-- "Standing to
America, bringing home black gold, black

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,570
ivory, black seed," is kind of glory and
that contrast between evil, "Deep in the

53
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,570
festering hold thy father lies, of his
bones, New England pews are made, those

54
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,120
are altar lights that were his eyes."

55
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,640
- They also kind of need a religious
figure throughout this voyage because

56
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,800
throughout this we see that they're going
through a time of spiritual crisis.

57
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,950
"What port awaits us, Davy Jones or home?
I've heard of slavers drifting, drifting,

58
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,480
play things of wind and storm and chance,
their crews gone blind, the jungle hatred

59
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,600
crawling up on deck." It's like they
understand that they're becoming

60
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,490
uncivilized and they're trying to find a
way to change this.

61
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,770
- To justify their actions.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,750
- That's what they need, a justification
for their actions. So, they say God is

63
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,460
with them and everything is okay.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,150
- And you have that sort of anaphora of
the hymn, that "Jesus our Savior pilot,"

65
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,680
throughout this entire thing that sort of
brings and invokes the God into all of

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:42,200
this so that it's almost as if to me,
they're looking for their justification.

67
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,320
They're looking to justify the horrific
actions that they're putting out.

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,950
- Which is ironic because these are often,
these spirituals are often sung by slaves

69
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,760
to get through all of the times of
turmoil. So, it's ironic that they're

70
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,890
claiming that God is on their side as a
justification for the enslaving of blacks.

71
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,380
- I think it's also ironic, though, that
the blacks are the ones who receive the

72
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,750
justification from a lot of the whites in
the new world. At the end talking about

73
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,210
John Quincy Adams, he says it was
completely justified what the blacks did

74
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,040
when they revolted and attacked the white
slavers. The suffering that they had been

75
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,610
enduring...

76
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,860
- And that's like the moment of irony.

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,570
- Yeah.

78
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,920
- The slavers are saying, "How paradoxical
indeed that you whose wealth, whose tree

79
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,410
of liberty are rooted in the labor of your
slaves should suffer the august John

80
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,470
Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion
of the right of chattel slaves to kill

81
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,030
their lawful masters..."

82
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,210
- "...And with his Roman rhetoric,
weave a hero's garland for Cinquez." This

83
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,500
is what I want you all to think about.
Think about the historical connections

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,450
here. John Quincy Adams, one of our
founding fathers, fourth president of the

85
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,670
United States
was ultimately the man who got freedom or

86
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,250
found freedom in court for Cinquez and the
other slaves that were on the Amistad,

87
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,250
which is a ship that, of course, being
discussed in here. Think about these

88
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,680
historical connections. I shall return.

89
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,507
All right, group. What's going on?

90
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,650
- We're talking about a poem.

91
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,290
- You're talking about a poem? I'm going
to talk about a poem, too.

92
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,170
- What a coincidence.

93
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,130
- I know. Isn't it coincidental? What's
going on? What are you all discussing so

94
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,980
far?
- We're looking for the marrow part.

95
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,980
- You're looking for the marrow part?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,210
- I'm glad you all have your "Beloveds"
out and everything. What really interests

97
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:45,300
me is the fact-- I think we have a real
instance here where the 60 million or more

98
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,960
to whom the book was dedicated. This is
their story, is it not? What do you all

99
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:58,033
think? How can we connect our reading of
this poem to our reading of "Beloved?"

100
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,307
- In the second part, in the last
paragraph, it says, "The fever is melting

101
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,538
down my bones."
- Yes.

102
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:07,510
- Right now we're connecting that to Stamp
Paid, who at some point had said that he

103
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:14,750
was tired in his marrow, as in his bone
marrow. We're looking for the page right

104
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,329
now.
- Okay. Found it.

105
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:18,697
- Okay.
- And it's on this.

106
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:20,926
- Whoa. What is that? Read the passage to
us.

107
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:23,930
- "'My marrow is tired', he thought. 'I've
been tired all my days, bone tired but now

108
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,580
it's in the marrow. It must be what Baby
Suggs felt when she lay down and thought

109
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,013
about color for the rest of her life.'"

110
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:34,600
- Okay. So, let's connect what you say in
this stanza, you have, "I'd be trading

111
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,550
still but for the fevers melting down my
bones." What is it about that stanza that

112
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,340
you want to connect to this allusion?

113
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:50,480
- We thought that her fever is melting
down-- we thought that it was, it's pretty

114
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,180
much the exact same connection because
it's bones going into the marrow, so the

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,730
outside going into the inside. "The fever
is melting down to my bones," it's just

116
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,990
taking a different way.

117
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,040
- And to get more than a physiological
point of view here, the marrow is where?

118
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,190
Where is the marrow?
- In your bones.

119
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,770
- It's like the core. So, Raphael, when
we're suggesting that the marrow is being

120
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,740
corrupted in some way, what does it mean
for us?

121
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,180
- It basically means that the entirety of
the whole of the being is being corrupted.

122
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,850
- Okay. So, in essence, then, from a
symbolic point of view, just like in

123
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,490
"Beloved," we can relate this to the
poem. What kind of corruption do you see

124
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,511
here?

125
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:30,780
- For me, it was mainly corruption of
hypocrisy.

126
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,580
- Okay. Hypocrisy in what context?

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:42,420
- Mainly that the enslavers honestly
believed that they were in the right, that

128
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,820
they were different, like this passage,
this short passage here. "It sickens me to

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,810
think of what I saw, of how these apes
throw overboard the butchered bodies of

130
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,760
our men, true Christians all, like so much
jetsam."

131
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,400
- Yes.

132
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,500
- And then at the very beginning, they're
talking about how they're throwing slaves

133
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,865
overboard.

134
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:04,160
- Or even when the slaves decide to, "Lost
three this morning leaped with crazy

135
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,070
laughter to the wading sharks, sang as
they went under."

136
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,226
- Yeah.

137
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:11,040
- So, there's this sort of weird
juxtaposition of the whites being thrown

138
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,690
over by the savages or the apes at the end
versus the slaves who choose to jump over

139
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,710
at the beginning. Laura, what do you think
is going on in this particular context?

140
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:29,920
- With all of the jumping off board, it's
a true escape to eternal freedom, I guess

141
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,080
if you believe in Heaven. The thing that
confuses me is I understand why the savage

142
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,530
blacks would throw the whites over,
obviously death and more of a pain, but it

143
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:48,160
also ends their misery in a way of staying
on the ship with the slaves getting the

144
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,560
sickness, the blindness and having to
wait, I think it's like another three

145
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,810
weeks before they come to port. So, it's
really contrasting and interesting how it

146
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,381
goes back and forth.
This poem focuses, I think, on both sides,

147
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:04,308
on black and white.

148
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:06,514
- Yes. It really does illustrate both.
Which do you think is best illustrated,

149
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:09,320
Laura, the black side or the white side?

150
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,360
- The black side is really, I don't want
to say common, but it's similar to

151
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,540
everything you hear about slave ships--
- And the slave trade.

152
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,080
- ...and the slave trade. So, I think
it's interesting that Hayden decided to

153
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,560
also put in the white side of it because
you don't really focus on what came of

154
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,100
slavery. Even though it was a horrible
thing, on the last page here it says,

155
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,780
"That you whose wealth, whose tree of
liberty are rooted in the labor of your

156
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,240
slaves," I thought it was interesting
because I often fail to make the

157
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,820
connection that through the slavery, we
actually were able to grow as a country

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,370
and through our liberty first, we were
able to bring the slaves out eventually

159
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,090
through the Civil War.
- Jordan, continue.

160
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,200
- I was looking at more of the religious
side of it as with what you were just

161
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,790
talking about. Here it says, "Their
moaning is a prayer for death."

162
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,910
- Yes.

163
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,280
- "Some try to starve themselves." And
then you go down one, two, three, four

164
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,320
stanzas later, it says, "Jesus Savior
pilot me over life's tempestuous sea. We

165
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,740
pray that thou will grant, O Lord, safe
passage to our vessels bringing heathen

166
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,370
souls..." It's not so much praying for
death, it's praying and knowing that Jesus

167
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,870
can lead them to freedom forever and allow
them out of...

168
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,440
- Who is praying for Jesus here, Jordan?

169
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,080
- The slaves.
- Really?

170
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,056
- That's how I took it.

171
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,460
- Okay. Did anybody here take it a
different way?

172
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,840
- I took it as the sailors.

173
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,880
- Exactly. Good. Not that that's-- I think
you're on to something in the sense that

174
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,770
the religion of the slavers was eventually
forced upon the slaves themselves. So, I

175
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,900
think that they could be. So, I think
there's a real sort of duality there.

176
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,400
- For this point in history they
evangelized--

177
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,560
- Evangelized.
- They had already--

178
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,700
- Evangelized. Yes. It's a hard word to
say.

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,940
- Africa. I know the Dutch, for example,
had already been there.

180
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,100
- So, historically speaking then, Raphael,
when you say it's the slavers that are the

181
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,010
ones that are praying, what's ironic about
all of this?

182
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,150
- That they're so much in the wrong and
they don't see it all and that kind of

183
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,120
hypocrisy.

184
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,370
- And they're looking for justification
for their actions. Speaking of

185
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,850
justification, what I want you to think
about now for a few minutes-- I'm going to

186
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:38,790
talk to the other group up front here-- why
is it that the white side of things is all

187
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:44,660
reported to us literally through almost a
journalistic style? It's all quotes. It's

188
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,700
all basically kind of like it's from a
ship's log. So, think about this and I'm

189
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:59,750
going to be back to talk to you about it.
All right, group, what's going on?

190
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,790
- It's all going on.

191
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,660
- It's all going on? Okay. Tell me. What
have we discussed?

192
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,020
- Everything.
- Everything? Tell me more.

193
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:22,030
- Well, we've discussed about how in this
stanza, "That there was hardly room 'tween

194
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:28,170
decks for half the sweltering cattle
stowed spoon-fashion there; that some went

195
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,920
mad of thirst and tore their flesh and
sucked the blood. " That was talking about

196
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,830
the capture of the Africans.
- Yes.

197
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,990
- Who wouldn't be so thirsty that they
wouldn't tear open their own skin and

198
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,920
drink their own blood.

199
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,330
- Which is just crazy in terms of the
suffering.

200
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:49,880
- Yeah. And how that shows that in some
way they were driven into some sorts of

201
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:59,740
savagery. And yet in the next stanza, it
talks about how the crew would lay with

202
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,160
the--
- The Guinea Rose?

203
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,600
- Yeah.

204
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,280
- "The crew and cabin lusted with the
comeliest of the savage girls kept naked

205
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,940
in the cabins..." Okay. Well, let's
talk about it for just a second. We have a

206
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,000
real juxtaposition of pleasure and
suffering. What do you think?

207
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:22,470
- Yeah. It's a real contrast between
describing these people as sweltering

208
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:28,430
cattle ripping their flesh open and then
it goes right into how the crew, like,

209
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,850
would sleep with these women.

210
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,480
- Exactly. They're fully taking advantage
of them. Imagine being kept naked in a

211
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,430
cabin for the whole journey.

212
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:44,990
- Yeah. It's a very big contrast because
they are calling them animals.

213
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,930
- So, what happens after their lust? In
the stanzas right before we begin section

214
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,070
two of the poem, what details are we given
about what happens to this specific crew?

215
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,945
- They abandon the ship.

216
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:01,757
- It goes up in flames.

217
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:06,516
- Exactly. So, it's basically set on fire
and then what happens?
