1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,380
- [Teacher] We have been talking about
being a good speaker and a good listener.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,860
And in class, your teacher had you do an
activity in your classroom where you sat

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,580
across the way from a student and you read
them a paper that you had written about

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,120
dingoes. And then you had to stand up in
front of the class and you had to present

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,440
that. Do you remember that? Okay. So we
talked about what it sounds like to be a

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,970
good speaker and what it looks like to be
a good listener, and your teacher and I

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,870
worked on a rubric, and you got a grade
for some different things about speaking.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,600
Do you remember what any of those things
were that you got a grade on? Do you

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,060
remember what she was looking for?

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,250
- Posture.

11
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,520
- [Teacher] Posture. What do you mean by
posture?

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,680
- Not moving around.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,363
- [Teacher] Okay. So when you're standing
up in front of the class, what would you

14
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:57,995
look like?

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,499
- Standing straight.

16
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:03,363
- [Teacher] Okay.

17
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,531
- Not leaning against the wall.

18
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:09,080
- [Teacher] Okay, good. Do you remember what else
we talked about being a good speaker looks like?

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,380
- Voice.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:20,347
- [Teacher] Okay. What about your voice?
What should your voice do?

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,427
- Use your presentation voice.

22
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:29,979
- [Teacher] Yeah, like a presentation
voice. Does it sound like this? What does

23
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,026
a presentation voice sound like?

24
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:37,787
- Kind of loud, but not like an outside
voice.

25
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:40,635
- [Teacher] Yeah, kind of loud, but not
screaming, right? I like how you said not

26
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:50,675
an outside voice. All right. What else for
speaking? Do you remember what else? 

27
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:54,670
One of them, I know, didn't really have to do
with speaking, but it had more to do about

28
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,950
your report. And it was did your report
make sense? Right? Did what you write make

29
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:13,723
sense? What about if I read my report
really slow? Is that good?

30
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:18,586
- I can't remember...

31
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:23,963
- [Teacher] It starts with an "F".
Fl-...

32
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:27,387
- Fluency.

33
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,819
- [Teacher] Fluency. Good. And what does
that mean?

34
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
- You're not reading slow or too fast.

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,930
- [Teacher] Good, not too slow, not too
fast, just right. Okay. So we have posture,

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,910
voice, makes sense, fluency, do you
remember what the last one was?

37
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,419
You're not doing it right now.

38
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,580
- Eye contact.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,460
- [Teacher] Good. All right. You want to
make eye contact, right. Right. So when

40
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,750
you're reading, you want to be able to do
what?

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,080
- See the people.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,120
- [Teacher] Yeah, look at the
audience, right? Kind of look over your

43
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,490
paper and make eye contact with people.
Okay, now, if I'm a good listener, if I'm

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,790
the person sitting in the audience, how
can I show my classmates that I'm being a

45
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,730
good listener?

46
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,850
- No distractions.

47
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:38,030
- [Teacher] Okay. So, don't distract them.
What else?

48
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,999
- Don't be distracted by someone else.

49
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,022
- [Teacher] Okay.

50
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:43,000
- [inaudible]

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,900
- [Teacher] So you want to focus on the
speaker. All right. How can you show them

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,780
that you're focused on them. How would
they know?

53
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,310
- Look at them.

54
00:03:53,310 --> 00:04:00,340
- [Teacher] Yeah, look at them. Right?
Okay, look at the speaker. And what else?

55
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,790
What about at the end, when they're done?

56
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,080
- Ask questions.

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,660
- [Teacher] Good. Ask questions. Anything
else?

58
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,320
- Sit up straight.

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:26,340
- [Teacher] Okay. Good. Could you tell them,
maybe, how they did? What do we call that?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,990
Like feedback? What they did well
on, or maybe what they could do better?

61
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:51,320
Right? Okay. Put a star next to the ones
that you think you already do a good job

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:00,040
at. What do you think you do a good job
at? Okay. You're focused on the speaker.

63
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:18,470
All right, you sit up straight. Okay. You
don't distract others. That's good. Okay.

64
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,970
Now, out of these two, which one do you
think you need to work on? Which one could

65
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,500
you do a better job? That one. Okay. So
maybe you could ask more questions at the

66
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,910
end? Okay. All right. What about speaking?
Which ones do you think you do a good job

67
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,470
at already?
- Posture.

68
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,230
- [Teacher] Okay. You do a good job on
that one.

69
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,720
- Make sense.

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,910
- [Teacher] Mm-hmm.

71
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,590
- Eye contact.

72
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,820
- [Teacher] Mm-hmm. Okay, so out of your
voice and fluency, which one do you think

73
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,660
you could do better? Which one could you
work on?

74
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,450
- The voice.

75
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,130
- [Teacher] Voice. All right. So what do
you think you need to do better with your

76
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,080
voice?
- Speak up louder.

77
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,310
- [Teacher] Speak up louder? Maybe a
little bit closer to, like, that

78
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,230
presentation voice. Okay. On your rubric,
it was what, five, four, three, two, one?

79
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,160
Do you remember what you got on your
volume?

80
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,580
- Three.

81
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,660
- [Teacher] A three, okay. So Miss Welch
thought you could do a little better too,

82
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,060
so maybe next time you could get a four or
a five. Okay. So we have been talking

83
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,230
about famous African Americans, and you
had said that Walter Payton was somebody

84
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,800
that you had thought was interesting.
Right? All right. So we are going to look

85
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,950
at some information about Walter Payton,
and then, see if we can maybe do better on

86
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,830
asking questions, and maybe, working on
your volume. Okay?

87
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,080
- Cool.

88
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,090
- [Teacher] Okay. So, Austin,
the other day, you and I met and we did a

89
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:00,340
videotape of ourselves giving a little
speech about Walter Payton, and the first

90
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,180
one was I was speaking and you were
videotaping me. And then we flipped it,

91
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,930
and I videotaped you. So what I want to do
is have us watch those and see how they

92
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,970
turned out. And then we're going to use
this rubric that you use in your classroom

93
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,360
to kind of grade ourselves and see how we
did and talk about what we can do better

94
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,090
in the future. Okay? So we looked up some
facts about Walter Payton, and let's watch

95
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,390
my speech first. And I want you to be
thinking about while you watch me, how did

96
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:37,430
I do on eye contact? How did I do on my
volume? How was my fluency? Did it make

97
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,830
sense? And how was my posture? Okay, on a
scale of one to five, five being,

98
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,030
"Woo-hoo, Miss Suzer, you did a great
job," and one meaning, "Miss Suzer, I

99
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:53,173
didn't even see that at all." Okay? All
right, you ready? All right. Let's see how

100
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,358
I did.

101
00:07:57,678 --> 00:08:03,533
Walter Payton was one of the best running
backs in the NFL. He played for the Bears

102
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:10,318
after going to college in Mississippi.
Sweetness has over 110 questions. But he

103
00:08:10,318 --> 00:08:16,799
died in 1999 of liver cancer. He's one of
the best football players of all time. I

104
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,990
wish I could have seen him play. He was my
favorite football player.

105
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,840
All right. So let's see. What do you
think? Do you want to use purple or blue?

106
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,800
You want to be purple? Okay. So how do you
think I did on eye contact? What do you

107
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:46,007
think? You think a four? Okay, why do you
think a four? Did I give much eye contact?

108
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,080
- No.

109
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,370
- [Teacher] No? Oh, you're saying yes? I
only saw myself look up once, so I'm going

110
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,230
to give myself a two. I don't think I did
a very good job. You're too nice. Alright.

111
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,660
How was my volume? Pretty good? Okay. I
think I'll agree with you there. How was

112
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:11,040
my fluency or my rate? Good? Okay. I think
I'm going to give myself a four because

113
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,550
there were kind of parts where I thought
maybe I could have talked a little faster.

114
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:22,950
I don't know. All right. Did it make sense
what I said? Yeah? Okay. And how was my

115
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:29,490
posture? Was I standing up straight,
looking ahead. Okay. I wasn't like swaying

116
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,330
or rocking or anything? All right, so it
looks like, overall, I think I need to do

117
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,040
better on eye contact. And you thought I
could probably do a little better on eye

118
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,420
contact. And I think I could do a little
better on my fluency. I think I could have

119
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,080
maybe spoke a little bit faster. It
sounded like I was kind of in slow motion.

120
00:09:49,080 --> 00:10:01,242
Okay. So now, let's watch how you did. And
then we'll grade you. Okay? All right, so

121
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,642
here you are.

122
00:10:05,114 --> 00:10:44,000
- [inaudible dialogue as they watch video on laptop ].

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,090
- [Teacher] Okay. Let's see. All
right. How do you think your eye contact

124
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,902
was? A one? Why did you give yourself a
one?

125
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,911
- Because I didn't really look up.

126
00:10:54,911 --> 00:11:02,943
- [Teacher] You didn't look up at all, did
you? Were you looking at your paper? What

127
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,120
were you concentrating on?
- Paper.

128
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,720
- [Teacher] The paper? Okay. Yeah, I would
say, it would be good, maybe, if you held

129
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,570
your paper down at your belly button,
right, and then you could look up. All

130
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,060
right. How was your volume? Not evident?
Okay. I'm going to give you a two and a

131
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,660
half for your volume because we could kind
of hear you. I think the reason we

132
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,800
couldn't hear you is because you had the
paper in front of your face. I think your

133
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,160
voice might have gone out a little bit
more. All right. How was your fluency, or

134
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,030
your rate? What do you think?

135
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,000
- I didn't hear myself at all.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,420
- [Teacher] Okay. All right. I
thought it wasn't bad at all. I thought it

137
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,150
was pretty good because when I could hear
you, I thought it was probably like a

138
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,230
three and a half or a four. You weren't
reading really fast. You were reading so

139
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,260
that I could understand you. It was just
kind of hard to hear. All right. Do you

140
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,310
think your facts made sense? Why did you
give yourself a two?

141
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:09,440
- I don't know. I had some [inaudible]
in there and... I don't know.

142
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,210
- [Teacher] All right. Because you could
only hear parts of it? You think if your

143
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,980
volume had been better, you could have
heard more? Okay. All right. I'm going to

144
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,040
give you a four because I think it made
sense. All right. What about your posture?

145
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,050
How was your posture? Man, you're being
hard on yourself. Why did you give

146
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,030
yourself a one?

147
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,000
- Because I wasn't, I was like...

148
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,570
- [Teacher] Wiggling around a
little bit?

149
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,010
- Yeah.

150
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,070
- [Teacher] Okay. Well, I'm not going to
be that hard. I'm going to give you a

151
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,740
three. Okay, so if we were going to do
this again, maybe in front of your class,

152
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,770
or in front of your teacher, or something,
what would you do differently next time?

153
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:58,480
Now that you've seen yourself, what would
you do differently? Maybe the things you

154
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,950
got ones on, right? Okay. So, maybe
looking up, over your paper. Maybe your

155
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:12,250
volume. Yep. Maybe working on your fluency
or your rate, maybe a little faster,

156
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,080
right? What about your posture, what would
you do differently?

157
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,400
- Stand straight.

158
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,970
- [Teacher] Okay. Try to stand still. All
right. So, it looks like we have a couple

159
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,704
things we could work on, right, for next
time. Okay. Sounds good.
