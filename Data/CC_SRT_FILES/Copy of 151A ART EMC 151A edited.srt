1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,903
- [Teacher] Start using the
principles of design, okay?

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,481
So you look at the packet
for the principles of design.

3
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:06,308
With the principles of design, you gonna

4
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:08,890
be telling me what you
see in the work of art.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,069
So instead of shapes,
you may be telling me,

6
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:12,852
what's something you
see in your work of art.

7
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,863
You've got "Gold Is Where You Find It."

8
00:00:15,863 --> 00:00:17,406
What's one thing you
see in the work of art?

9
00:00:17,406 --> 00:00:18,195
- [Studen] Gold.

10
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,430
- [Teacher] You see gold, what else do you see?

11
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,483
- [Student] The miner.

12
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,364
- [Teacher] Miner, and what is the miner doing?

13
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:24,110
- [Student] Drilling.

14
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,061
- [Teacher] Drilling, okay, so
those would be all stuff

15
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:27,784
that you see in the work of art.

16
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:30,326
So go ahead and start on the
second part with analysis,

17
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:32,245
if you're ready to start on that.

18
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:36,988
(Background Chatter)

19
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,311
- [Teacher] Alright, are we doin' alright here?

20
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,419
- [Student] Yeah, we don't get how
was the work created.

21
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,242
- [Teacher] Okay, you may have
actually answered that

22
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,496
when you were up here.

23
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,899
If you look at the packet right here,

24
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,271
and the title of the work of art

25
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:47,822
is "The Sky Pond."

26
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:51,028
1933 to 1934, can you
read the rest for me?

27
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,656
Who it was who created it?

28
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,449
- [Student] Kauvar--

29
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,193
- [Teacher] Kauvar--yeah, close enough.

30
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:58,118
- [Student] Smith--
- [Teacher] Smith.

31
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,576
-[Student] --Born: Cape--Ugh, this is hard.

32
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,226
- [Teacher] If you can't pronounce it, just

33
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,315
do the best you can.

34
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:05,705
- [Student] Giradeau, Missouri--

35
00:01:05,705 --> 00:01:08,498
Missouri, 1893. Died:

36
00:01:08,498 --> 00:01:11,654
Denver, Colorado, 1977. Oil on canvas.

37
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,078
- [Teacher] Uh! What did you say?

38
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:13,981
- [Student] Oil on canvas.

39
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,832
- [Teacher] Is how it was created and it was about,

40
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:17,437
this size right here, okay?

41
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:20,205
So that tells you how the
work of art was created.

42
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,514
Later on, you're gonna look at why

43
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,049
the work of art was created,

44
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,992
and what purpose it served.

45
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,180
(Background Chatter)

46
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,932
- [Teacher] Yes?

47
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,844
- [Student A] What do I say, how--

48
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:30,184
- [Student B] I know what we do!

49
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:34,107
It says, if they draw it in three-dimensional--

50
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:34,807
- [Teacher] Okay.

51
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:36,734
- [Student B] And they take
some kind of colored pencil,

52
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:40,198
or painting, and then
sketch it like you do,

53
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:41,704
and then they go from dark to light.

54
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:42,651
- [Teacher] Yeah.

55
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:45,271
- [Student B] And, then they
make the texture from,

56
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,559
the sun is over here, and there's

57
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,809
a little bit of shade because,

58
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:50,680
this would be covering all this.

59
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,410
There would be a shade right here.

60
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,249
So it's over here, it would
be lighting everything

61
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,678
on this side of the tree,

62
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:57,429
- [Teacher] Yeah.

63
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,077
- [Student B] and this side of the house,

64
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,340
roof, and that side of the house.

65
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,737
- [Teacher] And you've got,
are these shapes back here?

66
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:05,382
Or are those somethin' else?

67
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,482
- [Student B] These are shapes.

68
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:08,729
- [Teacher] Okay, are shapes
flat or three-dimensional?

69
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,632
- [Student B] Three-dimensional.

70
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:11,732
- [Teacher] Shape forms are
three-dimensional, alright?

71
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,531
- [Student A] Oh yeah.
- [Student B] Yeah.

72
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:13,599
- [Student A] So those are forms?

73
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,857
- [Teacher] So those are forms, yeah.

74
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:15,856
But you were right about everything,

75
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:16,715
You were right about the sun,

76
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,285
you were right about the
texture, the shading, everything,

77
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,059
that's really good.

78
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,556
So you can tell a little about this

79
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,355
on how you think the work was made,

80
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:23,969
and also relate it to playing

81
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:25,791
with your pen on your finger,

82
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,649
and also oil on canvas.

83
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,234
Continue working, please.

84
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:32,904
(Background Chatter)

85
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,573
Alright, so y'all are on analysis now?

86
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:36,910
And what work of art do y'all have?

87
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,386
Y'all have got "Subway."

88
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,661
Alright, so what are y'all lookin' at

89
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,604
in the Subway for analysis so far?

90
00:02:41,604 --> 00:02:45,416
- [Student] It's something, asymmetrical balance.

91
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,914
- [Teacher] It's asymmetrical balance?

92
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:47,950
- [Student] Yeah.

93
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,813
- [Teacher] There are three types.

94
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,343
You've got symmetrical
balance, when everything

95
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:51,521
is exactly the same,

96
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,960
you've got asymmetrical balance

97
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,516
when it's weighted the same.

98
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,663
So there's the same
amount of weight visually.

99
00:02:56,663 --> 00:02:57,882
It's not exactly the same.

100
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:58,983
And then you've got radial symmetry,

101
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:00,987
which is a project we
did a little bit earlier.

102
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:01,556
Okay? Good.

103
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,066
(Background Chatter)

104
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:10,638
- [Girl] So, is it saying that shapes,

105
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:11,990
especially right here,

106
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,042
these shapes are more rounded

107
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:18,421
versus straight and flat.

108
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:20,698
'Cause these are more 3-D than these.

109
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:24,924
These kind of have shadows and are free.

110
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:25,973
So, we were saying how

111
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:30,508
that makes the consistence more complex

112
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:33,584
than the simpleness of the,

113
00:03:33,584 --> 00:03:35,940
outside factors, I guess?
- [Teacher] Yes, mm-hmm.

114
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,153
Good! Keep going.

115
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:38,903
Alright.

116
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:40,706
- [Girl with Pink Shirt]
Would this be water?

117
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:42,541
- [Teacher] That is
possibly water right there.

118
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,472
Yes it is.

119
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,226
And what part are y'all on?

120
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,746
Y'all are on the analysis right now? Okay.

121
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:48,848
And y'all are lookin'
at the "Valley Farms"

122
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:49,978
by Rose Dickinson?

123
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,898
Okay, cool.

124
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,032
So what do y'all have so far for analysis?

125
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,721
- [Girl in Grey T-Shirt]
Colors from the scene

126
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:57,631
go together, it can show--

127
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:59,534
- [Teacher] Could you speak
a little louder? Sorry.

128
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:00,942
- [Girl in Grey T-Shirt] Colors
from the scene go together.

129
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,801
It can show, a straight web is going

130
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,597
along the farm with the bridge in there.

131
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:07,200
A small fire is going on,

132
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,989
with smoke coming from the flames.

133
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,938
Smoke is coming from the mountains.

134
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:13,300
- [Teacher] Sounds good, keep going.

135
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,548
Alright, let's check in over here.

136
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,883
How are y'all doin'?

137
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:19,606
- [Student] Good.

138
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,555
- [Teacher] Okay, wow, y'all have
got a lot for an analysis.

139
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,959
(Chuckles) Alright,
what else do you have?

140
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,201
So y'all are about ready
to start on analysis?

141
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,229
- [Student] Yes, sir.

142
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:31,176
- [Teacher] Okay, so let's look here.

143
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,353
Now tell me how all the answers

144
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,669
from the description you just made,

145
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,004
are related to each other,

146
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,524
i.e., how the effects were organized,

147
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:40,891
complement one another, or
create harmony or distress.

148
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,833
This step can often be the most confusing,

149
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,807
because it is very similar to the first,

150
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:46,174
and can easily overlap.

151
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:49,498
A good suggestion is think
about all the principles of art:

152
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,020
movement, rhythm, variety,
portion, emphasis,

153
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,985
and balance, and contrast
work together, okay?

154
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:56,418
So think about how they work together

155
00:04:56,418 --> 00:04:57,924
to create this work of art, and tell me

156
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,038
everything you see in the work of art,

157
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:02,069
but not by shape and colors.

158
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,630
Alright.

159
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,847
- [Boy in Beige] The shapes
and colors of the background

160
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:13,234
create a texture that will--
- [Boy with Jacket] What?

161
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:15,357
- [Boy in Beige] A texture--
- [Boy with Jacket] What?

162
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,015
- [Boy in Beige] The-- (sighs)

163
00:05:17,015 --> 00:05:19,817
The shapes and colors of the background,

164
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:22,990
create a texture that will--

165
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,402
- [Blonde Boy] Like he is actually
drilling near a cave.

166
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:26,564
- [Boy in Beige] Creative.

167
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:27,667
- [Teacher] Now, would you say,

168
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,671
these warm colors or cool colors?

169
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,840
- [Boy in Beige] Warm
- [Blonde Boy] Warm, way warm.

170
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,857
- [Teacher] Warm? Now why would you say

171
00:05:31,857 --> 00:05:32,678
they're warm colors?

172
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:33,720
- [Boy in Beige] 'Cause they're darker.

173
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,763
- [Teacher] They're darker? Okay.

174
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:35,937
- [Boy wearing Jacket]
It shows that the colors

175
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:38,609
of the background...(Background Chatter)
- [Boy in Beige] Yeah.

176
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:40,878
- [Teacher] Now something else.

177
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:42,875
Does it look like he
blends into the background?

178
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,031
- [Boy in Beige] No.

179
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,325
- [Teacher] He doesn't?
- [Blonde Boy] Yeah, uh-huh.

180
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,899
- [Teacher] Okay, so think about that too.

181
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,231
If he stood out, he would look like

182
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,230
he maybe didn't belong,

183
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,249
but it kind of looks
like he belongs there.

184
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:53,712
I like what you said, keep working.

185
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,824
I'll be back in a minute to check on you.

186
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,085
Alright, Guys.

187
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:02,965
Turn around.

188
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,489
Alright, what are y'all workin' on now?

189
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:06,743
Analysis?
-[Student] Analysis.

190
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:09,013
- [Teacher] What do y'all have for
analysis so far, Patrick?

191
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,735
- [Patrick] I didn't get that.

192
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:15,646
I got one for variety and balances.

193
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,807
- [Teacher] Okay, so something is different

194
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,702
from this picture.

195
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:27,114
Can you just read to me what
you have so far, please?

196
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:28,557
- [Patrick] Something's different
from this top picture,

197
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:31,247
because the floor is
green beneath the room,

198
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:32,987
because it's different, because I thought,

199
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:37,901
I thought the floor's just one color,

200
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:39,234
so that's why it's different.

201
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:42,305
- [Teacher] Okay, that's good, and it's
also different from up here.

202
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:43,768
You could say that there's a contrast.

203
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:47,191
Let's look for the definition
of contrast in here.

204
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,920
Do you all know what the
definition of contrast is,

205
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,355
or what contrast is?

206
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,848
- [Boy in Red] Two things
are very different from--

207
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:54,554
- [Boy in Black] I was on
balance, I'm on balance now.

208
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:56,176
- [Teacher] Okay, so contrast is what?

209
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,813
One more time, I'm sorry.

210
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:59,366
- [Boy in Red] Two things
that are very different,

211
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,929
and have a large contrast.

212
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:02,774
- [Teacher] Okay, so
would you say cool colors

213
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,446
and warm colors have a strong contrast?

214
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:06,003
- [Boy in the Corner] Yeah,
because they're bright colors

215
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:08,177
and they give out perspective.

216
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,533
- [Boy in Black] What about the two Cs?

217
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:11,298
- [Teacher] Okay, two C's, so?

218
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,963
Keep going.

219
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,259
Alright, what part are y'all on now?

220
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,524
Analysis?

221
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:20,587
And y'all have got "The Subway", okay?

222
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,348
So, can you read to me what you have,

223
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:23,846
or tell me something
that you haven't added,

224
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:25,060
but you were about to?

225
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,156
- [Blonde Boy] Jaymen's adding that.

226
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:26,919
- [Teacher] Okay.

227
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,823
- [Jaymen] I wanna add,
it has radial balance,

228
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,667
because you can kinda see

229
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,245
where the center print is, and then

230
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,918
you can kind of see all these
people, all these stuff.

231
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,244
- [Teacher] Okay, now I have a question.

232
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:39,299
Have y'all seen that there's a commercial

233
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,555
on a few months ago?

234
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:42,700
- [Blonde Boy] It's a radio commercial!

235
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,451
- [Jaymen] Yeah!

236
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:46,307
- [Teacher] The TV, where
she's sitting in the train,

237
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,333
and she's watching the TV,

238
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,407
someone's reading the newspaper

239
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:50,761
and she's watching the TV?

240
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,115
And she steps out, and it looks like

241
00:07:52,115 --> 00:07:53,554
they may have gotten the idea,

242
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:55,489
from that ad, from this work of art,

243
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,288
'cause there's lots of
people on the train car,

244
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:58,837
they're reading newspapers and she steps

245
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,924
into the future, by actually reading her's

246
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:03,243
on a Samsung Galaxy or
something like that.

247
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:05,146
So that'd be a good connection

248
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:08,311
to popular culture, okay?

249
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:11,176
- [Blonde Girl] Hello,
I was just (Background Chatter)

250
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,520
- [Teacher] Which one we
were talkin' about earlier?

251
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,871
Okay, sounds good.

252
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:18,000
What's up?

253
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:19,848
Okay.

254
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,239
Alright, what ya on?

255
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:29,760
Okay, what added, or what 
have y'all gotten to

256
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,820
since I was last over here?

257
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,999
- [Girl in gray] We see the
ocean behind the mountains,

258
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,822
green grass is covering the farmland,

259
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:36,820
and the lines on the mountains

260
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,643
are curved, not pointed.

261
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,621
The mountains are curved.

262
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,933
- [Teacher] Okay.

263
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,137
- [Girl in gray] The houses are spread apart,

264
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:46,489
the sky is a light green-blue.

265
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:48,800
- [Teacher] Sounds good, and it sounds like

266
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,448
y'all are just about
finished with analysis,

267
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,649
so are y'all gonna be moving
on to interpretation next?

268
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,977
Okay.
- [Girl in gray] Yeah.

269
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,221
- [Teacher] Active listening, right hand.

270
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,474
Active listening, left hand.

271
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:00,643
Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people

272
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:03,441
are having really great
and meaningful discussions

273
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:05,097
in the groups, but please remember

274
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,628
that we are all doing
different works of art,

275
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:10,310
studying them, and we're also
discussing them together.

276
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,888
So that everybody's able to work

277
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:13,644
without yelling across,

278
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:15,801
can we take it down just a
notch, a little bit, please?

279
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,147
Keep it a little bit lower?

280
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:18,459
I'm not telling you to whisper,

281
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:19,957
and I'm not telling you
to stop what you're doing,

282
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,177
'cause your doing a great job.

283
00:09:21,177 --> 00:09:22,756
Just let us take it down a notch, please.

284
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:24,232
Keep working, please.

285
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,162
Alright, how are y'all doin' over here?

286
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,462
- [Student] We're doing really good.

287
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,157
- [Teacher] Okay, what can you tell me about

288
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:35,737
your analysis on this work of art?

289
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,528
- [Student] It said that for the first question,

290
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,024
well, the first thing,

291
00:09:41,024 --> 00:09:42,962
we said the artist Douglass Crockwell

292
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,976
is using repetit-- well, is 
repeating shapes and colors

293
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:49,913
to create a visual image of the painting.

294
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:52,870
And right now, we're writing,

295
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,695
how classes are organized.

296
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:00,817
- [Girl in Plaid] And how it's saying

297
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,792
what we introduced for description.

298
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,761
- [Teacher] Okay, now, with "Paper Workers",

299
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,283
Now let's look at the workers.

300
00:10:07,283 --> 00:10:09,303
The workers, do they
look like they stand out

301
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:12,064
from the industry and from
the industrial aspects

302
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,300
of this work of art?

303
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,862
- [Girl in Green] No.

304
00:10:13,862 --> 00:10:15,419
- [Teacher] They kind of
look like they blend in.

305
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:16,824
So could they actually be considered

306
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,519
to be parts of the machinery?

307
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,382
- [Girl in Green] Mhmm.

308
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:20,447
- [Teacher] Okay, so
that's something you may

309
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,542
wanna think about when
you're working on analysis,

310
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:24,277
or when you switch over to interpretation

311
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:25,253
in just a little bit.

312
00:10:25,253 --> 00:10:26,414
Can you go touch the keyboard

313
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:28,911
to bring the Smart Board back on, please?

314
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,036
Alright, what are y'all workin' on now?

315
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:35,141
- [Boy in jacket] I don't know.

316
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:36,337
- [Teacher] You don't know, okay.

317
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:39,356
You don't know what
principles you've covered,

318
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:41,463
or you don't know what
aspect of the painting

319
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:43,058
you're working on right now?

320
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,943
- [Boy in beige] We're
working on analysts,

321
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:48,993
and so far we've covered how the miner

322
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:51,593
and the vat ground relate to each other.

323
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,288
We covered what colors they have

324
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:55,823
and how they can relate.

325
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,680
We're about to work on shapes.

326
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,906
Shapes are in there.

327
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,236
- [Teacher] So let's
think about texture, some.

328
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:03,781
- [Boy with beige] Yeah, we are.

329
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:05,363
- [Teacher] Look at the definitions, okay.

330
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,588
And let's look at...

331
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,968
I wouldn't look at space or balance,

332
00:11:09,968 --> 00:11:12,866
variety, and you may wanna look

333
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:16,339
at the definitions of proportion, okay?

334
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,760
- [Blonde Girl] Okay, we are completely,
totally, and absolutely,

335
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,673
confused of analysis.
- [Girl in Black] I'm not!

336
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:27,171
You're just--

337
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:29,665
- [Teacher] Analysis, okay.
- [Girl in Black] I'm not!

338
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,435
- [Blonde Girl] I'm completely finished.

339
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:32,188
- [Girl in Black] She's going all haywire.

340
00:11:32,188 --> 00:11:34,996
- [Teacher] Okay, what's
wrong with analysis here?

341
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:37,063
- [Blonde Girl] I don't know.
- [Girl in Black] Nothing!

342
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,014
- [Girl in Black] Nothing's
wrong with the analysis.

343
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:40,124
- [Teacher] Nothing's wrong with analysis?

344
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:41,259
- [Girl in Black] She's going haywire.

345
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,735
- [Blonde Girl] I do not
understand what art is.

346
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,559
- [Teacher] Active
listening, right hand please.

347
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,262
Active listening, left hand.

348
00:11:48,262 --> 00:11:49,655
Table four, please.

349
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,211
Ladies and gentlemen, when
we stopped a moment ago,

350
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,370
because we had gotten too loud,

351
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,705
let's take it down to a whisper now.

352
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,747
That way everybody can hear themselves

353
00:11:57,747 --> 00:11:58,909
without getting too loud.

354
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,742
So right now, let's take it to a whisper,

355
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:02,868
for our discussions, please.

356
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,563
Alright, with analysis what you're doing

357
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,128
is you're looking at the
principles of design.

358
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:09,044
Don't worry about balance.

359
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:11,246
Let's flip to the beginning.

360
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,552
Now, let's look at texture.

361
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,594
Do you have a texture in here?

362
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:18,208
- [Girl in black] Yeah.

363
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,695
- [Teacher] And what kind
of texture do you have?

364
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,323
- [Girl in black] Well it's really bumpy,

365
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,735
but some of it is smoother,

366
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,049
like a snow.

367
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,049
- [Teacher] Okay, so that's what you

368
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,765
could talk about in the analysis.

369
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:33,134
Also in the analysis, with balance:

370
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:36,187
is it asymmetrical,
symmetrical, or radial?

371
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:39,402
Now, symmetrical is when things
are the same on both sides.

372
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:42,035
Radial is when it's radiating out

373
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,118
from a point, like a rim or a pizza.

374
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:45,779
Is it either one of those?

375
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,002
So, I'd look a little bit
at asymmetrical balance,

376
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,137
and then variety.

377
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,826
I look at the definition,
and then determine

378
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,836
what variety you see in
here, and after that,

379
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:56,850
go ahead and move over
to interpretation, okay?

380
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,569
That way, if you're being frustrated,

381
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,049
you don't have to get bogged
down and worry about it,

382
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,554
you can move to the next step.

383
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,154
You might find that easier, okay?

384
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:07,006
Keep going, thanks.

385
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,785
Alright, so y'all are
on interpretation now?

386
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:13,615
- [Student] Yep.

387
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:15,921
- [Teacher] Okay, what are y'all about
to do for interpretation?

388
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,940
Can someone read me the
interpretation part?

389
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,487
- [Student] Basically, how does the
painting make you feel?

390
00:13:22,487 --> 00:13:24,426
What does it make you think of?

391
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:29,244
Don't say you think a
painting sucks, artwork sucks.

392
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:32,808
That said, that goes in the next step.

393
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:36,280
What do you think,

394
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:40,126
What do you think the artist
is trying to communicate

395
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,175
to you as a viewer?

396
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,758
- [Teacher] Okay, so let's bring the painting

397
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,459
back over here so you can see it

398
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,978
while you're working on the questions,

399
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:52,084
and think about telling me
a story, or what's going on.

400
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:54,527
Now, does this look like
you're in a cafeteria?

401
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:55,188
- [Students] No.

402
00:13:55,188 --> 00:13:56,124
- [Teacher] Does it look like you're in a school?

403
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:56,640
- [Girl] Oh yeah.
- [Boy] No.

404
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,325
- [Boy] It looks like a barber shop.

405
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,353
- [Teacher] Okay, and
what does it look like

406
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:03,527
is going on in the barber shop?

407
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:05,685
- [Boy] He's shaving,
cutting someone's hair.

408
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,628
- [Teacher] Now what about over here?

409
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:10,455
- [Boy] These guys are probably
waiting for their turn.

410
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:11,923
- [Teacher] Okay, that's what you need

411
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,078
to tell me in interpretation.

412
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,764
What all is going on, or everything

413
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:19,091
the artist had within the work
of art that tells a story.

414
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,393
We're talking about the story

415
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,032
that's created in the work of art.

416
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,859
Alright, what part are
y'all on, interpretation?

417
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:28,954
- [Blonde Girl] Yeah.

418
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:30,163
- [Teacher] Okay, so...

419
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:34,336
- [Blonde Girl] It kind
of makes me feel like...

420
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,346
- [Blonde Boy] It makes me feel sad.

421
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:37,259
- [Blonde Girl] It was,
when I think of it before,

422
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:38,997
and it really doesn't make me feel sad.

423
00:14:38,997 --> 00:14:41,481
I'm not really sure how it makes me feel,

424
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,112
but I kind of think that

425
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:47,847
maybe he was trying to say,

426
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,475
it went from-- 'cause
this is kind of simple.

427
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,185
- [Teacher] Okay.

428
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:53,241
- [Blonde Girl] And I keep
going back to the simple

429
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:55,168
and complex for some reason.

430
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,584
But, I think he was trying to say

431
00:14:57,584 --> 00:14:59,568
that maybe things were simpler,

432
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:02,481
and it kind of got more modern.

433
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,436
- [Teacher] I like that, I like that.

434
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,029
And also, one thing that
this makes me think of,

435
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:08,375
is earlier this year, we studied

436
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,826
the artist Jacob Lawrence,

437
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,428
and one of his was a work of art

438
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:13,472
of a guy on a train, controlling that

439
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,050
with only industry in the background.

440
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,408
With the big cog or wheel here,

441
00:15:16,408 --> 00:15:17,872
it kind of looks like a train over here,

442
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:19,172
with industry in the background.

443
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:21,192
But I like what you're saying
about the calmer times,

444
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,330
and the more difficult times,

445
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,304
and I think that would be a great thing

446
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:24,685
to have in your interpretation.

447
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:25,760
- [Blonde Boy] It doesn't
look like a train, though.

448
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,792
- [Teacher] Yeah. (Chuckles)

449
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:28,836
Alright, how are y'all doing?

450
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:30,225
Y'all doin' alright?

451
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:31,827
Hey, what part are y'all workin' on now?

452
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:33,091
Y'all got "Valley Farm?"

453
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:34,391
- [Girl in Pink] Yeah.
- [Girl in Grey] Yeah.

454
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,455
- [Girl in Pink] Interpretation.

455
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,383
- [Teacher] Okay, what
do y'all have so far

456
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:39,023
for interpretation?

457
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:40,380
- [Girl in Pink] This
painting makes us feel bright,

458
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,523
but kind of boring.

459
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,044
The smoke from the mountains

460
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,762
make us wonder who is making it.

461
00:15:44,762 --> 00:15:45,408
We also wonder,

462
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:48,589
"Why is there a fire with nobody there?"

463
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,052
- [Teacher] Okay, sounds good.

464
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:59,147
Ah, can you put your stool back up on two legs?

465
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:00,339
One more time? Thanks.

466
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:03,770
Alright, what are y'all on right now?

467
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,579
Analysis, and y'all have
moved on to interpretation?

468
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,072
- [Student] Mhmm.

469
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,838
- [Teacher] Sounds good.

470
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:15,017
Active listening, right hand.

471
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,694
Active listening, left hand.

472
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:18,736
Right in here, we have
about seven minutes left.

473
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,698
This should give enough
time for most everybody

474
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:22,173
to finish their interpretation,

475
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,797
and start on their judgment today.

476
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,574
After you get finished
with your interpretation,

477
00:16:25,574 --> 00:16:27,269
one thing I would like you to focus on,

478
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,335
is why you think the
work of art was created.

479
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:31,471
Think about the time period,

480
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:32,772
in which it was created,

481
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:36,081
and why the artists were
creating works of art.

482
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,569
Think about your work of art particularly,

483
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:40,370
and you'll be able to have a space

484
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,611
on your paper to answer that,

485
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:43,609
so continue working on
what you're working on.

486
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,314
We have about seven minutes.

487
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:46,209
Next time you come in,

488
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:47,000
what we're gonna be doing is

489
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,579
we're gonna be working on presenting.

490
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:50,798
So, those groups that have enjoyed this,

491
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:53,280
will be able to look at
the Smithsonian packet,

492
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,617
find their information,

493
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,461
add that to what they've been doing today,

494
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:58,413
and then present on their findings

495
00:16:58,413 --> 00:17:00,677
regarding what they thought
about the work of art

496
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,677
along with what the
historians thought about--
