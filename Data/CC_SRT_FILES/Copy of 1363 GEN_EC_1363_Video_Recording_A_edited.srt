1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:02,431
- Until I say switch.

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:04,850
So you stay at your center
when you are finished.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,019
When I say switch, you
may go to the next center.

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,686
Okay? All right, so.

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:13,182
Here are different centers.

6
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,648
You know where you go,
you may go to your center,

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,148
and you may begin.

8
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:32,006
(children talking indistinctly)

9
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,624
Let's go back again, let's
make sure we're pushing.

10
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:39,707
There you go.

11
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:56,822
(children talking indistinctly)

12
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:04,507
- 14, 14, 14.

13
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:13,485
Where should we start them?

14
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:14,318
Good job.

15
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:16,615
Nice job.

16
00:01:21,073 --> 00:01:23,142
Where do you think we
should start our cubes

17
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,046
when we're gonna measure?

18
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:26,879
- Here.

19
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,520
- Yeah.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,323
- Because we wanna line
it up where it starts.

21
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:33,156
- Good.

22
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:41,309
- Nathan used more force to do it.

23
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,483
- Right, Nathan used a little bit

24
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,579
more force than you, didn't he?

25
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:52,018
So when you used more
force, what did that do?

26
00:01:52,018 --> 00:01:54,018
- It made it go farther.

27
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,847
- It made it go farther, good job.

28
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:05,279
All right guys, if you are
done, put your thumbs up.

29
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:08,163
If you are still working,
raise your hand in the air.

30
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:12,442
Okay, I'm gonna give you about
one more minute to finish up.

31
00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:19,442
(children talking indistinctly)

32
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,900
All right, how did it go?

33
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:32,036
- (mumbles)

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,073
Okay, very nice.

35
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:45,469
(children talking indistinctly)

36
00:02:52,685 --> 00:02:54,768
Where should we start it?

37
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:09,962
Now if we're measuring, where
do we need to start the cube?

38
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:10,795
Nice job.

39
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:23,565
(clapping)

40
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,749
All right, I want you to
stop what you're doing.

41
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:29,117
You need to pick up your
clipboard and your pencil,

42
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:30,592
and you need to switch.

43
00:03:30,592 --> 00:03:34,342
Leave the cubes and the
pucks at the station.

44
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:38,355
Clipboards, pencils, and switch.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:53,840
(children talking indistinctly)

46
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:56,754
- We have no puck over here.

47
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:59,837
- Here it is.

48
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:24,447
Have an idea for you. Okay, hold on a second,
let's go down the list.

49
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,780
I want you to come back, put that away.

50
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,971
I saw Teddy go like this

51
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:32,062
and put his fingers here, and go up.

52
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,312
Why did you do that, Teddy?

53
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:41,113
Where it was, but when
he marks the paper there,

54
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,728
he needs to really leave
it there and then push

55
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:45,148
the other ones up.

56
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:49,076
And I need someone else to
come over here and measure.

57
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:53,428
Now, we knew it was 10 here,
what are we gonna count next?

58
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:55,578
What comes after 10?

59
00:04:55,578 --> 00:04:57,661
- 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

60
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:02,070
- 15, okay, go ahead and record that.

61
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:13,234
- How do we know when it's
supposed to be a (mumbles)?

62
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:19,772
(background noise drowns out conversation)

63
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,054
- Okay, so whose turn is this one?
- Mine.

64
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:32,496
Where do you need to start lining it up?

65
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,022
- 50.
- [Teacher] 15?

66
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:47,518
- 50.
- [Teacher] 50?

67
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:51,101
So if we did 10, what
comes after 10? 11...

68
00:05:52,698 --> 00:05:56,115
- 12, 13, 14.
- [Teacher] 14. Right there.

69
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,043
Nice job.

70
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,229
All right, stop what you're doing.

71
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,614
I want you to go ahead,
pick up your clipboard

72
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:17,016
and your pencils, and you may switch.

73
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:41,016
(children talking indistinctly)

74
00:06:44,003 --> 00:07:02,253
(background chatter)

75
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,325
- Let me do it.

76
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,573
- Can I ask a question?

77
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:23,020
- Sure, what would you like to ask me?

78
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:35,187
(background noise drowns out conversation)

79
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:37,339
All right? Okay.

80
00:07:39,337 --> 00:07:40,301
That's a good question.

81
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:44,051
All right, who's gonna
go next in this group?

82
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,633
Okay, why don't you hold on one second.

83
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:53,624
Can you move over a little bit?

84
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:55,791
Get behind it and push it.

85
00:07:57,196 --> 00:08:06,196
(children talking indistinctly)

86
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,242
- 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

87
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,560
- Yeah, I did.

88
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,138
- What do you notice
about those two numbers?

89
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:21,805
- Oh, it's two 19's.

90
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:31,205
- I think Amber might get the 19.

91
00:08:33,497 --> 00:08:35,820
- You think she might get 19?

92
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,214
- No, she didn't.

93
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:41,283
- (laughs) Do you wanna
try pushing it again?

94
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,033
- Here, start behind.

95
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:58,100
(background noise drowns out conversation)

96
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,000
Nice job.

97
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,319
All right guys, go ahead
and switch one more time.

98
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:12,319
Take your pencil and your clipboard.

99
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:27,608
(children talking indistinctly)

100
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,723
- You can go first.

101
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,853
- Okay, guys.

102
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:59,089
Let's get our pencil so that
we know exactly where it is.

103
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,172
- Right here.

104
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,410
- Okay, so now go ahead and count.

105
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,250
So what did you come up with?

106
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,750
- 13.
- [Teacher] 13, good job.

107
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,864
Let's turn the clipboard
around so you can.

108
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,364
- Three backwards.

109
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,321
- 35.
- Whoa!

110
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:33,404
- All right, now whose turn is it?

111
00:10:33,404 --> 00:10:34,515
- DaMonte's turn.

112
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:36,182
- Go ahead, DaMonte.

113
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,436
Now where do we need to start counting?

114
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:51,519
- Right here.

115
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,897
- Can you give him some tips?

116
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:58,186
Where do you think he
should start counting?

117
00:10:58,186 --> 00:10:59,526
- Right here.

118
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,060
- Okay, and why?

119
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,777
- The line.

120
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:05,014
- That's where the tape begins, right?

121
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:09,345
Or you could even go like
this and start it at the tape

122
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:11,762
and then you use your pencil.

123
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,892
- So where does the pencil stop?

124
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:23,975
- Right here.

125
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:27,442
- Okay, so then count to there.

126
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:31,490
I'll hold it for you, you count.

127
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,007
- 10.

128
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,698
- Ben, what do you think?

129
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,115
Can you help him?

130
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,115
- Seven.

131
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:47,032
- So Ben thought that he got seven.

132
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:49,826
- Yeah, it's seven.

133
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:52,098
- Okay, so we're gonna stop
where the thing begins,

134
00:11:52,098 --> 00:11:55,026
so we're gonna stop at the seven, okay?

135
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:56,859
Here you go, good job.

136
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,542
(clapping)

137
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,630
Okay, I want you to
stop what you're doing.

138
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,977
I want you to quickly come to the carpet

139
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:11,402
with your pencil and your clipboard.

140
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:14,024
Come to your circle spot.

141
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,545
I'm gonna count down from five,

142
00:12:15,545 --> 00:12:17,565
I want you to be on the carpet at zero.

143
00:12:17,565 --> 00:12:18,398
Five.

144
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,363
Four.

145
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:25,977
Three.

146
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,763
Two.

147
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,498
One.

148
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,534
And zero.

149
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:41,063
I love how you guys get to the
carpet so nice and quietly.

150
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:41,896
Thank you.

151
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:46,195
Give yourself a pat on the back
for doing a really good job.

152
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,891
Now, I wanna know what you noticed

153
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:51,352
about using the different surfaces.

154
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:53,821
What did you notice about the tile,

155
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,831
what did you notice about the wood,

156
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,805
what did you notice about the cloth,

157
00:12:57,805 --> 00:13:00,151
and what did you notice about the carpet?

158
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,363
Sophia.

159
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,608
- I noticed that the cloth
and the carpet was harder.

160
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:06,942
- It was harder?

161
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:09,986
And so what do you think happened?

162
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,751
- The puck slowed down.

163
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:15,668
- The puck slowed down,
what made it slow down?

164
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,986
- The bumps on the towel.

165
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:22,362
- The bumps on the towel, and
when we watched that video

166
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:24,306
that talked about the
bumps, do you remember

167
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,563
what they called that?

168
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:29,792
What is it that causes those bumps?

169
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:31,693
- [Teacher] Nathaniel?
- It pushes back.

170
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:33,017
- It does, it pushes it back.

171
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:36,274
What's that big word that
we've been talking about?

172
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,670
- Friction.

173
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,553
- Friction, so do you think
there was more friction

174
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,719
on the towel?

175
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,874
- Not when I did it.

176
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:46,255
- Okay, so Monalisa,
share what you noticed.

177
00:13:46,255 --> 00:13:50,781
- When I pushed mine, it
went all the way down.

178
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:55,341
- It went all the way down,
so which one had more friction

179
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:57,424
when you were testing it?

180
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,397
Which one slowed down
or did not go as far?

181
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:05,897
- (mumbles)

182
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:12,759
Which surface was slower, do you remember?

183
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:14,937
- The carpet.

184
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,560
- The carpet, so the carpet
for you had the most friction?

185
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,208
Okay, so does anyone else
wanna talk about their surface?

186
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,427
Kayley.

187
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:27,427
- The cloth, when I pushed the puck,

188
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,166
it went kind of far,

189
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:42,281
but not really far,
because of all the bumps.

190
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:48,835
- Which surface had the
least amount of friction?

191
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:52,364
Daniel.

192
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:53,197
- Wood.

193
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:54,475
- The wood.

194
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:58,544
Give me a thumbs up if
the wood was also the one

195
00:14:58,544 --> 00:14:59,960
with the least amount of friction.

196
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,793
Good job!
