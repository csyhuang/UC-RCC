1
00:00:00,114 --> 00:00:02,546
- I want you to go ahead
and put a "C" over your 10

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:04,030
at the top of this if you haven't.

3
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:08,531
And I want you to take
a look at the part one

4
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:09,829
on your paper.

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,217
Yesterday, we looked at how pressure

6
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:14,722
could effect the mantle,

7
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,122
but now we need to look
at something different.

8
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:22,365
I want you to answer
number one and two first

9
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,833
and then we'll talk about it.

10
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:27,096
This is just what you know
before you come in my room

11
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,506
to get you into the lesson.

12
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:31,791
So, number one wants to
know list a few things

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,028
that you have seen float before.

14
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,653
Number two wants to know
what do you think

15
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:40,567
might cause these things to float.

16
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:44,259
So, first just make a little
list of two, three things

17
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:45,734
that you've seen floating before

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,191
and then tell me on number two,

19
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:51,957
if it's a hypothesis you may
not know for sure that's fine,

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,480
but what do you think
causes them to float.

21
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:57,114
Nathan.

22
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,809
- Are we allowed to write both?

23
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,256
- Yeah.

24
00:01:00,907 --> 00:01:02,601
Yeah, so right now,
you're just going to make

25
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,267
a little list on number one

26
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:05,555
and then number two,

27
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:09,058
you're going to tell me what do you
think actually causes these things

28
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:12,111
that you wrote down to be able to float.

29
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,633
We're going to start with that first.

30
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:22,835
This is just to get us thinking

31
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,200
about what we're doing today.

32
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,209
One and two, please.

33
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,930
What do you think causes them to float?

34
00:01:56,538 --> 00:01:58,106
You might not be sure of the answer

35
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:01,590
to number two, but I still
want you to make a hypothesis.

36
00:02:01,674 --> 00:02:03,090
You don't have to write
"I think because,"

37
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:07,267
but you can tell me what
you think causes that.

38
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:24,710
Number two's going to be harder

39
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,626
than number one.

40
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:26,933
- Yeah.

41
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:37,997
- Let's take four things,

42
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:40,718
tell me four things that
you've seen float before.

43
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:43,016
We'll take four, because
we can probably sit here

44
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:44,165
and name like 100.

45
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,078
Cole, give me one.

46
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:46,028
- Ice cubes.

47
00:02:46,028 --> 00:02:46,983
- Ice cubes. Sadie?

48
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:48,097
- Boat.

49
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:49,181
- A boat. Alex.

50
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,617
- Shoes.

51
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:52,241
- Shoes. And Emily?

52
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,841
- Dog toy.

53
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:54,871
- Dog toys, okay.

54
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:58,727
Now, we know things can float

55
00:02:59,464 --> 00:03:00,438
and that's great.

56
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:08,376
But, what do you think
causes these things to float?

57
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,050
Why do you think dog toys
and a boat and ice cubes

58
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,298
and things like that,

59
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,594
why are they are going
to be able to float.

60
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,563
Ebony, what do you think?

61
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,908
- The air in them.

62
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,554
- The amount of air that's in them.

63
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:25,174
Anybody else?

64
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,398
Dylan?

65
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:27,365
- They are less dense.

66
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:29,611
- Okay. Sean?

67
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:30,967
- Surface tension.

68
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:32,097
- Surface tension.

69
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:36,389
- Little air pockets that are in them.

70
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,635
- Okay, air pockets.

71
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,719
- I was thinking like the less density

72
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,258
inside of it.

73
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,578
- Okay,alright, we're going to
take a look at that today.

74
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,512
So, you've got a kind of idea,

75
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,074
we're going to look at what
causes something to sink

76
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:55,321
and what effects if something floats.

77
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:57,812
Alright, we have two parts

78
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,341
that we are going to be going
to our last stations for.

79
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,087
So, let's take a look at part two

80
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,710
last station observation.

81
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,598
You have two setups at your lab station.

82
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:11,213
You have a black tray that
has three objects in it.

83
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:15,499
You've got a bouncy ball, a
marble and a styrofoam ball,

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,567
alright?

85
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:19,035
You also have a setup
at your lab station

86
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,103
that has liquids in cups.

87
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,786
This is for part three.

88
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,611
Alright, I don't want you
touching this stuff yet.

89
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,214
We're going to come back later

90
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,625
and you're going to
look at that stuff.

91
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,389
I don't want any of the
cups knocked over,

92
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,307
I don't want any of the
objects put into the cups, okay?

93
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,037
These two things are separate,

94
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:40,837
your black tray and the piece of paper

95
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:42,395
with the cups are separate.

96
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,073
What you're going to do first

97
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,397
is use the black tray
and the objects in it.

98
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:48,045
You're going to tell me

99
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,785
with the marble, the bouncy
ball, and the styrofoam ball

100
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:52,954
if we were to put these in water,

101
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:54,206
which we are going to test them,

102
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,450
but if we were to put
these in water,

103
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,634
do you think these objects
would sink or float?

104
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,812
So, you just go through
and if you want

105
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,034
you can just write an "F" or an "S."

106
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,802
You're going to say what you think

107
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:09,235
and I want you to wait until
you get to your lab stations

108
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,868
so you can pick them up, feel them

109
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:15,350
to see, that might make a
difference in your guess.

110
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:18,952
Then, I also want you
to tell me why.

111
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:23,167
While you are at your lab station,
float or sink in water

112
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,389
and why.

113
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,948
You're not going to do
the did it actually float

114
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:29,668
because we're going to look
at that when we come back.

115
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:31,324
These are our results.

116
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,462
So, you're going to do
the first two columns,

117
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,049
float or sink, why, float or sink,

118
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:36,364
why, float or sink, why.

119
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:38,616
- Then we are going to come to that?

120
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,612
- And we are going to come back,

121
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,401
and we're going to do an
observation together.

122
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,823
So these two columns have
got to be filled out

123
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:47,592
before you get back to your seats.

124
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:50,135
Got it? Let's go.

125
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:06,226
- Marble, sink. Rubber, float.

126
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,671
[Background Chatter]

127
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,195
- Rubber, float.
Styrofoam, float.

128
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,145
- The marble will probably sink,

129
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:23,936
it's heavy.

130
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:25,865
- It has no air in it.

131
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,185
- Bouncy ball.

132
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:42,208
The bouncy ball probably can float.

133
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,467
- Yeah.

134
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:44,762
- I mean it's not light,

135
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:46,125
- It's gonna float.

136
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,334
Bouncy ball, same thing.

137
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:56,224
- Bouncy ball, heavy.

138
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:01,866
Marble, heavy with no air pockets.

139
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,221
No--

140
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,726
- This one will definitely float

141
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,348
because it's lightweight

142
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,416
and it has these little pores.

143
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:27,513
- This bounces a lot, 
his bounces a little bit

144
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,463
and this bounces not at all.

145
00:07:30,753 --> 00:07:32,201
- Yeah, but this one, but this one

[Background Chatter]

147
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:35,564
- If this one can float,

148
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:37,911
then why not think
that one could float?

149
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:40,316
- Okay.

150
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,463
- If you don't go
with your group,

151
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:08,513
that's okay, but you still
need to a connection.

152
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:16,823
If you are finished before the timer goes
off you need to come back to your seat.

153
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:17,716
- This will float.

154
00:08:18,063 --> 00:08:19,079
- This will fall.

and take a look,

161
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:46,342
before we see the results.

162

Before we look at the
results and test this,

163
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,524

00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:00,077
let's start with the marble
since it's at the top.

166
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:04,100
Raise your hand if you
think the marble will float.

167
00:10:06,604 --> 00:10:09,010
Okay, so we're all together
on this one,

168
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,239
it's not going to float.

169
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,596
Who can tell me why
they're thinking

170
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,445
it's not going to float?

171
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:18,954
We'll take like three
guesses, three explanations.

172
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:19,988
JC?

173
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:22,248
- It's heavy, with no air pockets.

174
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,713
- Heavy with no air pockets, good.

175
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:25,778
Frayla?

176
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,893
- It can't capture air,
it can't float.

177
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,675
- Can't capture air, can't float.

178
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,675
Alright and Emma.

179
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:33,937
Heavy and solid.

180
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,014
- Heavy and solid.

181
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,068
Alright, now what about the bouncy ball.

182
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,733
Raise your hand if you think
this is going to float.

183
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:43,623
Alright, there's a mix.

184
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,167
- What, that's heavier
than the marble.

185
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:46,507
- Well, let's hear --

186
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:47,662
[Background Chatter]

187
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,768
Somebody give me an explanation
for why it would float.

188
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,524
If you guessed float tell
me why you thought that.

189
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,877
Sean.

190
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,194
Because there's air inside.

191
00:10:58,273 --> 00:10:59,263
- Okay, there's air inside.

192
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,056
Alex.

193
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:03,867
- I dropped it in the pond
and it still floated.

194
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,268
- Bouncy ball floated in the
pond when you did it before.

195
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:07,659
Ali.

196
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,769
I've seen it happen.

197
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,790
- Okay, you've seen it happen.

198
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,565
Now, some of us said it would sink.

199
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,299
Why did you say it would sink?

200
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:16,658
Matt Weaver.

201
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,586
- Because it's heavy.

202
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:19,335
- It's heavy.  Frayla.

203
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:29,033
[Background Chatter]

204
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:31,474
Okay, Jared.

205
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,385
[Background Chatter]

206
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:35,635
Okay, so prior experience.

207
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:39,056
Now, last one is our styrofoam ball.

208
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:41,676
Float, raise your hand.

209
00:11:46,057 --> 00:11:49,657
Alright, somebody give me a
reason why it's going to float.

210
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,154
We're all together on this one, too.

211
00:11:51,154 --> 00:11:53,999
We all agree the marble is going to sink,

212
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,425
we all agree the styrofoam
ball is going to float.

213
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:58,437
Matt Cook.

214
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,964
- It's light and has air pockets.

215
00:12:01,182 --> 00:12:02,495
- It's light and has air pockets.

216
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:05,380
Alex?

217
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,042
[Background Chatter]

218
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,084
You're talking alot of things,

219
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:13,766
the pond was last time, okay.

220
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:16,009
Frayla.

221
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,915
It's very lightweight

222
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:23,553
[Background Chatter]

223
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:26,161
- Okay, alright, let's test it out.

224
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,231
We're just going to test
it out upfront here,

225
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:31,765
so I'm just going to
use this big beaker.

226
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:33,784
What do we want to see first?

227
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:35,769
- Marble.

228
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,891
- Bouncy ball.

229
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:44,187
- Alright, record sink for your actual.

230
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,607
I guess we'll do bouncy ball,

231
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:49,723
we'll just go in order.

232
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:51,429
Alright, bouncy ball, ready?

233
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,286
The moment of truth.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,489
[cheers]

235
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:00,687
And styrofoam ball.

236
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,078
- Yeah.

237
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,483
- A different bouncy ball didn't float.

238
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,618
- But you saw the bouncy
ball I was using, right?

239
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,474
- Yeah.

240
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:11,529
- So, it was fair, right?

241
00:13:12,156 --> 00:13:12,709
- Yeah.

242
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:20,446
- Very simple, but let's take
a look at what's going on.

243
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,636
For number four,
I'd like you to tell me,

244
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,740
I want you to answer first
and then we'll discuss.

245
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:26,645
What I'd like you to tell me,

246
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,578
why do you think some of these
objects were able to float,

247
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,241
while others were able to sink?

248
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,517
And I want you to be specific.

249
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,477
At the beginning, I asked
you the same question

250
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,956
on number two in prior knowledge.

251
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,527
Why do you think some
of these things float.

252
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:43,021
I want you to revisit
that question again.

253
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,353
So, why do you think the
marble and the bouncy ball sank

254
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:49,380
and the styrofoam ball was floating.

255
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:51,836
I want you to be specific on number four.

256
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:53,991
I want you to answer first on your paper

257
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:55,840
and then we're going to share, okay?

258
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:53,791
What kinds of things did
we say for number four?

259
00:14:54,006 --> 00:14:56,707
Now that we've looked at
this in a different way.

260
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,234
Before, I just asked you to
think of things in your past

261
00:14:59,234 --> 00:15:00,027
that you've seen float.

262
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,602
Now, we've looked at our marble,

263
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,598
our bouncy ball and
our styrofoam ball.

264
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,963
What did you say?

265
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:07,604
Nick.

266
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:10,602
- Bouncy ball didn't have enough air

267
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,867
to keep it up and it was too heavy.

268
00:15:14,277 --> 00:15:17,148
- Okay, anybody else say anything.

269
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,921
Nick said, bouncy ball
didn't have enough air

270
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,033
to keep it up so it sank.

271
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,921
Anybody say something different?

272
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:25,887
Ebony?

273
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,921
- Density and buoyancy.

274
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,103
- All right, what do you mean
density and buoyancy?

275
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,023
Okay, Frayla?

276
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,413
- I said that some objects
had air holes

277
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,978
and some were just solid.

278
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,285
- Okay.  Now let's think of
this in a different way.

279
00:15:46,505 --> 00:15:48,413
We've got this really small marble

280
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:52,077
and we've got a much
larger styrofoam ball.

281
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:56,163
So, normally if something's smaller,

282
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,252
you think it's going to be lighter,

283
00:15:59,296 --> 00:15:59,997
it should float.

284
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:01,257
Something heavier,

285
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:02,654
this is much larger,

286
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,891
but it didn't sink.

287
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,331
If I have one book,

288
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:11,175
if I'm carrying one book
versus carrying five books,

289
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:13,492
that's different because
five books are bigger

290
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:14,743
than one book.

291
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:20,183
So, what is going on with the
amount of stuff in the marble

292
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:23,950
and the amount of stuff
in the styrofoam ball.

293
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:28,167
Is it the same amount of stuff
in the same amount of space?

294
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,724
Does the marble have
the same amount of stuff

295
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:34,564
in the same amount of space
that the styrofoam ball does?

296
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,677
Which one has more stuff,

297
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,321
more matter in a smaller space.

298
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:46,474
I want you to talk with the
person sitting next to you

299
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,330
for one minute.

300
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:35,639
Okay, so, we've done this before.

301
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:44,417
Okay, so, marble's number one,
styrofoam ball, two.

302
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:48,519
Which object has more stuff,
more matter,

303
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:51,442
packed in a smaller space?

304
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,696
On the count of three, right here,

305
00:17:55,164 --> 00:17:57,254
marble one, styrofoam ball two.

306
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:59,163
One, two, three.

307
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,165
- Marble.
Good, marble.

308
00:18:05,413 --> 00:18:07,395
So, let's write that down.

309
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:10,112
This is pretty much what
number five is asking you.

310
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:12,311
So, when comparing the
marble to the styrofoam ball,

311
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:15,745
which one has more mass,
more matter, more stuff

312
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:18,882
in a smaller amount of
space, which we call volume.

313
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:23,033
That would be the marble, alright.

314
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,076
People today, if you flip
over to the next part,

315
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,684
I've heard the word
density a couple times

316
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:35,284
and density is kind of.
