1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,830
- Take a look at that goal just to remind
yourself whatever it is you're going to be

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:10,010
working on. And this, we want to remind
you that it's kind of dinner party

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,460
conversation-ish. You agree with people at
dinner parties. You disagree with people

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,130
at dinner parties, but it's civil, because
it's friends that you invited over to your

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:26,510
house. You don't raise your, you don't
raise your hand at dinner parties. You

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,510
wait until, you wait until

7
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,390
[inaudible].

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,210
You wait until someone else is finished
speaking before you start speaking, of

9
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,390
course, because that's polite dinner
conversation. You add on to what one

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,720
another says. But like I said, we don't
necessarily have to agree. And then when

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,020
the topic starts to die down at a dinner
party, somebody else brings something else

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,860
up. So you can raise your own questions as
well. So the seminar is open, and my

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,910
question to you guys is who you think is
most to blame for the deaths that occurred

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,160
at the end of "The Veldt."

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,710
- What did it mean, like, George having,
like, I think that, I know a lot of times,

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,760
where he, especially in the, towards the
back, he... it goes back a little ways.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:23,190
He's, like, talking a lot of things, like,
comments turning, comment, commen-, I

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,200
can't say that word. He says they're going
to turn the house down possibly for a

19
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,050
month, and how he pick out the picture
painter. And he was telling his, he was,

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:40,610
like, talking to his son a lot and, like,
about not, about doing what his son would

21
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,500
not want to have happen, and how he
spoiled his children so much. So he takes

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,650
out, there's a lot of things that his son,
his son and daughter, it just doesn't say

23
00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:02,380
as much, wouldn't like, because... yeah.
But he wasn't, like, he wasn't, like...

24
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,290
- I agree that...
- "Oh yeah, I'm gonna go die today!"

25
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,610
- I agree that it was...

26
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,050
- He didn't want to die.

27
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,500
- I agree that it was...

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,080
- Of course he didn't want to die. Who
wants to die? Except for if you're suici-,

29
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,270
you know, suicidal.
- I agree that

30
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:16,700
[inaudible],

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,930
and on Page 15, where it says, um, it's
mostly on 16, but starts on Page 15.

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:28,080
"Won't this house and this room replace
you and your wife and your children's

33
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,780
affections?" It assumes their mother and
father grow more important in their lives

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,720
than their real parents, and now you want
to come along and shut it off? Kind of

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,230
shows why that they hate them. And because
it, because it's, since the nursery is

36
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,500
their parents, it's like some guy who
thinks he can tell you, coming along and

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,430
can tell you to kill your parents, you
know?

38
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,810
- It's the same thing as they're doing,
though. They're killing their parents.

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,090
- Well...

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,580
- But they think the nursery is their
parents.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,630
-...they don't think their parents are
their parents. They don't matter as much

42
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,200
as parents.

43
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,960
- If they'd been nice to them, and now
they're going to turn everything off, then

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,070
isn't it imbalanced? So now they're
relying on the house, because that's what

45
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,750
they've learned to do, as...
- Yeah.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,670
- It'd be like, take an example, people
are killing their parents.

47
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,790
- And on Page 15, it says, like... I
also think that it's, the dad says, "I

48
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,090
sen-..." The psychologist says, "I
sensed only that you had spoiled your

49
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,610
children more than most, and now you're
letting them die in some way." So if

50
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,810
they, like, they don't really know, like,
when someone says no to them, they've been

51
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,200
spoiled so much they don't even, like... 
well, they just can't take it. It makes

52
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,460
them go all crazy and stuff. So they
wanted to kill them, because they, like,

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,170
couldn't fly to New York, so...

54
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:51,850
- Yeah. Because I think
[inaudible]

55
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,290
- And if their parents, and if their
parents, and if they felt that their

56
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,690
parents were actually their parents, then
maybe not. But since their parents don't

57
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,990
really take care of them, it's the house
that takes care of them.

58
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,740
- Yeah.
- And then the...

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,400
- The house and the room replaced their
parents.

60
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,870
- Yeah. Their parents and friends.

61
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,270
- It's not like the parents could...

62
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,930
- They don't have friends, because
they're, the room, they get all these

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,580
adventures because of the room.

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,810
- Yeah.
- They don't have friends.

65
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,190
- And they kind of, like, rely on the
house to give them stuff all the time.

66
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:25,000
- If the house refused them, if it could,
then I don't think that they would want to

67
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:29,960
kill it. I think that it's just because
they don't feel like their parents are

68
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,190
actually their, they don't, they feel,
their parents aren't important to them. So

69
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,910
when they say no...

70
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,010
- On page, on page 13, the mom's saying,
"That sounds stressful. Would I have to

71
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,920
tie my own shoes instead of letting the
shoe tier do it? And brush my own teeth,

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,940
and comb my hair, and give myself a bath?"
The kid's, like, now relying on

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,030
everything. He's never had to do something
for himself. So he doesn't really, like,

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,000
know.
- Yeah.

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,340
- He's gotten so, like, stuck on having
everyone do things for him, he thinks,

76
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,770
like, doing your own thing would be, like...


77
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,630
- A challenge.

78
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,170
- Yeah. Like, and I guess you can use an
example as "Wall-E," a show. People get,

79
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,620
like, so fat, and they rely on everything
so much that, like, they have to move in

80
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,410
chairs, and they, when you golf, it's
virtual golf, there's a robot for you. So

81
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:25,620
they just, they take robotics and machines
to the next level, and they, it's all they

82
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,690
rely on. And so many people don't have to
work.

83
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,990
- Yeah, and weren't the ones that, like,
bought the house, that they were actually

84
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,000
the cause, because they were the ones ...
like, on Page 5 and 11, they even said

85
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,280
that, "We were the ones who bought the
house. We were the ones who got us into

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,390
this mess." So, but then all of a sudden
they just took it away from their

87
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,080
children, which made them mad. So again,
they were the one who was causing all this

88
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,820
madness in the house.
- I think it...

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,590
- Like, don't you think that people would
be sort of obese, like Elliot said?

90
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,580
- Yeah. They would be.
- They would be.

91
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,980
- Yeah, but then they'd be like everyone
else in the world.

92
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,840
- But then they also...
- Yeah, and...

93
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,920
- Getting exercise?

94
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,780
- But they're obese...

95
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,010
- And also, I think that it's George
Hadley's fault, not necessarily both the

96
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,490
parents, because the mom didn't really do
as much. Because, like, well, the quote

97
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:27,470
over there it said that, like, she's the
one who let them in for a minute. But. . .

98
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,269
- She just wanted to be nice.

99
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:34,780
- She just wanted to be nice. But I think
... like on Page two, it says, "But

100
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,190
nothing's too good for our children,"
George said. So I don't think it's as much

101
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:45,760
Lydia's fault, because she also tries to
get them out of the house instead of just

102
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,490
staying there. She just wanted to be nice
to the kids because George had shut it off

103
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,570
so abruptly. But I think it's more
George's fault that they spoiled them, and

104
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,168
that therefore gets himself killed.

105
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:04,998
- Does anyone know when this story was
written? Because I'm guessing it was...

106
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:05,950
- 1950.

107
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,340
- All right. Because I was, I'm guessing
it was wri- I was, guessing it was written

108
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:19,570
when women weren't, like, thought of that
highly. Because Wendy only actually speaks

109
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,968
once, and is a sniveling idiot most of the
time. And Lydia's, and Lydia Hadley is

110
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:31,690
pretty passive. And it's the guys that
are, have all the action, and have

111
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,024
anything really going on.

112
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,695
- Except in the final scene.

113
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,910
- Well, yeah. But that... she on-...

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,870
- She says one line. One line in the whole
book, basically.

115
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,140
- I know, but Lydia sort of has a bit of
action.

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,700
- Yeah, but...

117
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,280
- She doesn't do much. She doesn't, like...
. .

118
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,270
- She's pretty passive.

119
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:53,180
- She doesn't, like, um, disagree with her
husband or her kids. She doesn't do

120
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,610
anything like that. She just follows
whatever her husband says. Maybe she has a

121
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,760
few opinions, but not really.

122
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,330
- And Wendy says four words alone in the
whole thing, so...

123
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,330
- Well, I mean, you hear her screaming,
but other than that...

124
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,050
- Is that a word?
- Well, that was

125
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:09,510
[inaudible]


126
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,740
- Unless she's saying it...
- Close enough.

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,060
-...at the same time as Peter, like,
when they both come in and say, "Hello,

128
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,880
mom and dad"...

129
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,140
- Doesn't really count.

130
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,230
-...or when they both say, "Mommy,
daddy, come quick." But she's saying it

131
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,660
at the same time. She only says four words
by herself in the entire story.

132
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,610
- The screams are actually their parents,
when the kids were pretending in the

133
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,560
nursery that their parents were being...

134
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,330
- Yeah, they realized that at the end, but
they didn't really make that very clear.

135
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,800
They're like, suddenly they realized why
those screams sounded familiar. I thought

136
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,160
the whole book, or the whole story, that
it was, like, the kids' screams.

137
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,820
But it's actually the parents.

138
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,990
- What are...

139
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:48,871
- Yeah, because it's really not clear on
that. I figured that it's actually so they

140
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:49,266
all
[inaudible].

141
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,401
- Well, I'm, it's more, it's nicer to
have, like, a mystery, kind of.

142
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,770
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. I figured that it's the
author's fault.

143
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,740
- The what?

144
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,050
- The author's.

145
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,900
- But...

146
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,430
- How is it the author's fault?

147
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,160
- Because it's his story.

148
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:01,350
- Well, the author wrote it.

149
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,910
- That doesn't make any sense.

150
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,755
- But Carl, the author
[inaudible].

151
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:08,150
- Yeah, that doesn't make much sense. It's
not his fault. It's the... it's totally

152
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,910
off topic.

153
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,970
- Yeah, I agree with Elise. When I didn't
really get who the screams were until the

154
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:33,680
very end, where they said, yeah, that...
I think it's on Page... um, 19. But,

155
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,429
yeah, that they were... it says on Page
20 that, "Suddenly, Mr.and Mrs. Hadley

156
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:48,410
screamed, and suddenly they realized why
those screams had sounded so familiar."

157
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,000
So I thought it was the kids the whole
time, I thought...

158
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,310
- Aaron was saying something before, but
then everyone...

159
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,820
- What I was going to say is the, a little
while ago, when I was going to ask you,

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,910
why do people think it's, like, Peter
Hadley or other... because, I mean...

161
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,560
- The other is both of them.

162
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:12,042
- Because more or less the majority did
George Hadley. So why, just those people

163
00:10:12,042 --> 00:10:13,505
who did that, why did they do that?

164
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:17,910
- I understand with Peter Hadley, because
it is his, he seems to have the main role

165
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,280
of actually murdering the parents. But
it's not his fault he got spoiled. He

166
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,370
can't help it if his parents spoiled him.

167
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,810
- Yeah, because...

168
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,850
- Actually, even if the parents had been,
played more of a parent role, they would

169
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,110
still probably have preferred the nursery,
because...

170
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,531
- You don't need to
[inaudible].

171
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:44,660
-...the parents could still say no, and
the nursery does, they can, like, do

172
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,300
whatever they want with it.

173
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:55,740
- I agree with the both parents part of
it, even though the mom wasn't as involved

174
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,620
as George was, the mother was not do-,
posing a part in the kids' life as being

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,269
the mom, and the house was. So that caused
them to think the house was their parents,

176
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,241
and the house was their family.
- This is...

177
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,560
[inaudible]

178
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,920
- Indirectly... directly, I think...

179
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,500
- You can go.

180
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,570
- Directly, the, Peter was probably most
responsible for the parents dying.

181
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,290
- Directly.

182
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,630
- Directly. But indirect... well,
directly the lions were.

183
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,040
- Oh my God.

184
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,139
- Indirectly... but directly it was
mostly Peter, but indirectly, it was, it

185
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,576
was kind of everybody's fault.

186
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:45,200
- I kind of agree with, like, both the
parents, and then the dad. Because in the

187
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,290
beginning, the parents are, like, slowly
taking away some things, like the painter,

188
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,140
and not letting them go to New York. And
that kind of builds up their anger. But in

189
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,350
the end, the dad just wants to shut it all
off. And then the son starts getting

190
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,190
really mad and, like, threatening them,
finally they, like, get really mad, and

191
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,910
then they start imagining the parents
dying, and then...

192
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,830
- They've been imagining the parents dying
through the whole thing.

193
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,820
- I think it was the parents' fault, and
the inventor. Because, I mean, none of it

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,922
would have happened if they wouldn't have
had the, just, like, the super technology

195
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,724
house, and the nursery.

196
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,582
- So it's technology's fault.

197
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:29,809
- It's not the inventor's fault, because
he didn't know.

198
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,300
- But it's not the, it's not the
inventor's fault that they thought,

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,800
though.

200
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,870
- If he wouldn't have made it, it would
have never happened.

201
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,090
- And also, if the dad wouldn't have
bought it, it would never happened, too.

202
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,280
So that's my two opinions.

203
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,360
- They couldn't...

204
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,855
- But they bought it, but they made it and
bought it to be a good thing, not a bad

205
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:48,621
one.

206
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:52,530
- No one invented it so that you would, so
that it'd be used as a murder machine.

207
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,979
They didn't just make it, like, on the
advertisement, "Greatest Murder Machine

208
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:00,254
Ever."
- Perfect for murdering your parents.

209
00:13:00,254 --> 00:13:03,240
- We don't know, like, why he built it.
Maybe it was because of that, but you

210
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,847
don't know, like, exactly what his point
of the invention was.

211
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,960
- It was to, like, study the children's
thoughts.

212
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,957
- It was to study their minds.
- Because the children...

213
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,161
- He said that, but what if it's not?
- He's a liar.

214
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,505
- The children were mentally impaired, and
they needed to be looked up on, and they

215
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:21,175
wanted to know what they were thinking, so
...

216
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,000
- So a psychologist
[inaudible].

217
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:29,310
- Another good quote to show that it was,
to show that it might have, that it could

218
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:38,500
have been the parents' fault, was that, on
Page 11, it said... yeah, George said,

219
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,230
"Who was it that... who was it said,
'Children are carpets. They should be

220
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,980
stepped on occasionally.'" Because the
parents didn't, they didn't do anything to

221
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,580
the kids. They...

222
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,170
- They didn't really step on them that
much until the end.

223
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,680
- They just did what they want.

224
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,720
- They just all of a sudden just, like,
flattened them.

225
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,880
- Yeah, they just did it so abruptly.

226
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,200
- Yeah, they just started and let it go.

227
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,910
- It was just like, bam, you're dead.

228
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,820
- No wonder they wanted them dead.

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,520
- Guys, let's try and talk one person at a
time, or else we can't hear.

230
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:17,890
- My turn. Okay. On Page 15, it says that
the dad went from Santa, Santa to Scrooge.

231
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:23,500
And, like, if he would have taken away,
like, one thing at a time over a period of

232
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,490
time, I don't think the kids would be,
like, like, killing them. But it says he

233
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,420
just took all the good stuff away at once,
and they got, like, really mad.

234
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,350
- That's also kind of dangerous, though.
Because they started getting mad at him as

235
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:41,820
soon as they took away the picture
painter. So it was, they still could've

236
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
gotten mad. It's also more dangerous for
the parents to actually slowly take them

237
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,020
away, because they get more and more mad.

238
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,900
- All the anger...

239
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,490
- I have another opinion that I was trying
to say, but then I let Fiona go first.

240
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,660
That's not fair.

241
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840
- No, that's not, it's my fault.

242
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,880
[inaudible]

243
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,651
- All the anger built up because...

244
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:58,882
- Anyway, um...
