1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,590
- Just take it in, but take your
tube off first. Before you pull it out,

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:12,370
before you pull the needle out, take your
vacutainer tube off, and this is...

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,990
- Pull it out again?

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,710
- Yeah. Use your two by two remember.
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,670
- There you go. Good job, Faye. And, guys,
it just takes a while. This is not

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,990
something you're going to learn
overnight. This is a skill that it takes a

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,360
little while to learn. You've got to get
hand movements down, you've got to figure

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,910
out what works best for you. You know, if
you need things placed in a different

9
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:45,690
position. But after this, you all can
start sticking the arms when you're not

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,240
doing your book work. Then, whenever you
feel like you got all your hand movements

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,160
down, you feel like you're proficient,
then I'll watch you, which I'll watch you

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,651
doing, then you all will stick me.

13
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,181
So what do you think, Cassie?
- Hmm?

14
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:13,631
- What do you think? Is it easier than you
thought, or harder than you thought?

15
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,191
- Easier.

16
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:22,500
- Yay, Faye. Those arms are a little harder
to get... Those veins are not as easy to

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,221
feel as...

18
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:31,091
- That's okay. She's doing a fine job.
Two by two.

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,871
- Sorry. You [inaudible] to draw blood from them.

20
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:40,181
- Pop your tourniquet. Engage your
safety. Good job. From down there?

21
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:41,700
- Yeah.

22
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:46,420
- They say not to use these, and you can
use hand veins, but remember, first

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,890
choice, second choice, last choice, and
then hand veins. If you're going to do

24
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,380
hand veins, you all have been through a
lot of the book work already, if you're

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,660
going to use hand veins, what kind of
needle are you going to use?

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,200
- Butterfly.

27
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:01,960
- Butterfly. Okay I know you all have seen
them use butterfly in the clinic. You guys

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:09,400
will actually rotate through the clinic
lab. We'll do it at Dr. Maderis'

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,081
clinic, so that you all can get more
sticks there.

30
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:16,821
- Is there some people who draw only from
around here?

31
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:21,380
- Not usually. Now, there are some people,
they'll come in and they'll say, "You

32
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:27,670
can't get blood from anywhere from me
except here." What that one lady told you,

33
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,221
is right here, right...

34
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:31,681
- I'm better at popping it out. Remember I
couldn't get it in.

35
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:39,040
- Good. It will be something that, after
you get these hand movements down, it'll

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,270
just happen. Because when I'm not talking
while I'm doing it, I mean, it just flows.

37
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:53,460
Because I have done it for several years,
but for some reason after you get older,

38
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,481
it's hard to talk and do something at the
same time.
