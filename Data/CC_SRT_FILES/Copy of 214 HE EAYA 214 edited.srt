1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,452
- Write at the top of your paper

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:04,041
The color that you want for your sugar

3
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,338
and the color you want for your salt

4
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,067
- on both of them?

5
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:10,096
Sugar on one, salt on the other

6
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:13,437
- Yes, because you can
make from your sheet two.

7
00:00:13,437 --> 00:00:17,937
(group discussions)

8
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:19,517
Now the purpose of these sheets

9
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:22,569
is so you can actually take your spoon

10
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:24,282
Malik, take your spoon

11
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,088
and dip out onto that paper.

12
00:00:26,088 --> 00:00:28,920
This gives you a better visual

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,974
of how much sugar and how much salt

14
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,634
is in that particular food.

15
00:00:33,244 --> 00:00:34,453
Now what's the most important

16
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:35,698
thing about the label?

17
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:37,580
- Serving Size

18
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,962
- Serving size. Good Aaron, serving size.

19
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:42,338
So that is showing most of these

20
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:43,810
is the container itself.

21
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,984
That's the reason we went to snack foods

22
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:48,073
so that you could see how much that is.

23
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:50,847
This also gives you a better idea of

24
00:00:50,847 --> 00:00:52,740
how much you eat.

25
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,758
Some of you, like Aaron, may
eat two or three of these

26
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:57,454
especially if it was Gummies, right Aaron?

27
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:57,876
- Yes

28
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:59,491
- It's not Gummies but it's close

29
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:02,483
Okay, so any questions
before you get started?

30
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,459
Okay, decide who is
going to do calculations

31
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:08,178
decide who's going to measure first

32
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:10,560
I want you to rotate those
responsibilities around

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,193
and Devon, what is your question?

34
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,216
(group discussions)

35
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:18,528
Remember the personal column

36
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,294
is how much you would eat

37
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:41,194
(group discussions)

38
00:01:41,194 --> 00:01:42,617
- [Voiceover] the serving size

39
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:45,349
- Doesn't matter, your group remember

40
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,721
has to cooperate, figure out who's

41
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,761
going to do what and just look at responsibilities

42
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:56,149
- [Voiceover] Just make sure everyone sees

43
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,592
how much sugar; how much salt it is

44
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,281
That's the important part.

45
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,301
On the back of your paper.

46
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,304
- [Voiceover] When it says
about 29 grams right here

47
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:10,793
- What's the serving size?

48
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:22,047
- Serving size is here... [inaudible]
there are four servings in here

49
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:24,645
- [Voiceover] They would eat half the bag

50
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:26,092
then it would be two servings

51
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:54,244
(group discussions)
-So next is the total calories, and it's got...

52
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:55,323
- 130 calories

53
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,547
- total carbs

54
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:43,557
(group discussions overlapping)

55
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,946
- ok so nine grams

56
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:50,459
- Now when you dip out your salt and sugar

57
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:53,301
try to replace it in the correct bucket

58
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,173
we don't want the salt in the sugar or

59
00:03:54,173 --> 00:03:55,531
the sugar in the salt.

60
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:58,059
So pay attention to what you're doing.

61
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:34,650
(group discussions overlapping)

62
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,292
- Now remember, you have to calculate

63
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,525
what you would eat.

64
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:46,825
(group discussions overlapping)

65
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,884
- [Voiceover] Give me some sugar.

66
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,115
- [Voiceover] 11 grams divided by four.

67
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:58,295
(group discussions overlapping)

68
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,005
- Put two teaspoons on here

69
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:09,369
(group discussions overlapping)

70
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:10,393
- [Voiceover] Is it sodium?

71
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,198
- Dip it out you see how much

72
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:17,210
See visually how much it is.

73
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:45,173
(group discussions overlapping)

74
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:46,564
- I don't have any salt.

75
00:05:46,564 --> 00:06:39,658
(group discussions overlapping)

76
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,053
- Yes Paul

77
00:06:41,053 --> 00:09:56,554
(group discussions overlapping)

78
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,889
I want to encourage you

79
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,317
that after you done something that's

80
00:09:59,317 --> 00:10:00,794
really sugary, do something

81
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:03,044
that you would think would be salty

82
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,563
as if it surprises you,
how much sugars in it

83
00:10:05,563 --> 00:15:26,000
