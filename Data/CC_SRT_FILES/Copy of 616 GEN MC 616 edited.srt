1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,394
- [Teacher] Do you want to
measure this separately?

2
00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:04,803
Or do you want to measure
this with the ground water?

3
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,909
- [Boy in white] Should we measure this separately?

4
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:09,169
- [Cathy] Yea, 'cause that's the round rocks.

5
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,310
- [Teacher] Okay, what
were you saying Cathy?

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,317
Why is the ground water cleaner?

7
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:16,845
- [Cathy] Because the permeable rocks.

8
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:21,595
They clean the water on its way down

9
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:24,277
to the soil saturation.

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:30,558
- [Boy in white] There's 100 milliliters,

11
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:33,768
and you guys, could you
record the data real quick?

12
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:35,010
Write.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,120
Ground-- oh no, but we've
got to add this first.

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,048
Yea.

15
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,591
- [Cathy] Wait, we've got to add.

16
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:47,891
Is it still...?

17
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,124
But, let's do the--

18
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:52,690
- [Boy in white] Is that too much?

19
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,233
- [Cathy] Let's do the
answer for number one

20
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:56,151
while we're on it.

21
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:57,329
- [Group] Okay.

22
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,083
- [Cathy] It says,

23
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,226
- [Teacher] Good job--

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,561
- [Cathy] "Describe what you would do..."

25
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:22,192
(Background Chatter)

26
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:23,208
- [Student] Stop.

27
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,152
- [Teacher] But why is
your head right down level

28
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,487
with the measurement?

29
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:29,721
- [Boy in gray] We're doing that so we can

30
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:31,712
make sure it's exactly even,

31
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:33,477
'cause if we go over, then we won't know

32
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:35,004
exactly how much it is.

33
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,305
- [Teacher] And are you measuring the
runoff, or the ground water

34
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:38,991
right now?

35
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:40,925
- [Boy in gray] Right now we're measuring the runoff.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,463
It was about 380.

37
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:44,668
- [Teacher] It was about 380?

38
00:01:44,668 --> 00:01:49,304
Is it okay to get an approximate
amount for the volume

39
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,632
for this, and not an exact amount?

40
00:01:51,632 --> 00:01:53,513
- [Boy in gray] I think so, 'cause
then when we measure this,

41
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,760
we could still (Background Chatter).

42
00:01:58,354 --> 00:01:59,486
- [Teacher] Exactly.

43
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,753
Ashlyn, which had more water?

44
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:05,965
Your runoff, or your ground water?

45
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:07,352
- [Ashlyn] The ground water.

46
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:08,838
- [Teacher] The ground water had more?

47
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:09,924
- [Ashlyn] Yeah.

48
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,681
- [Boy in yellow] Yeah, 'cause they're overflowing.

49
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:14,318
- [Teacher] Oh my goodness.

50
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:16,584
Have you measured your ground water yet?

51
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:19,599
- [Boy in yellow] Not yet, I think
you can see it for video.

52
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:22,478
- [Teacher] Where is your ground water?

53
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,033
Oh, oh I see!

54
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:26,477
Oh, so this really did overflow?

55
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:27,080
- [Boy in gray] Yes.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,440
- [Teacher] So when you measure your ground water,

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,077
what will you need to do with the water

58
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,238
that's here in the tray?

59
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:35,119
- [Boy in yellow] I think put it in with the ground water.

60
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,744
- [Teacher] Yea, and measure that too.

61
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:37,952
Okay, this is your runoff?

62
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,555
- [Group] Yes.

63
00:02:38,555 --> 00:02:40,476
- [Teacher] Okay, so so
far you have how much?

64
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:41,807
- [Boy in gray] About 380.

65
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:42,823
- [Jade] And then there's some in here.

66
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:45,993
- [Teacher] Oh, you've
already measured 380?

67
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:47,078
- [Boy in yellow] About.

68
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:48,571
- [Teacher] Oh.

69
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,835
(Sound of water being poured)

70
00:02:53,835 --> 00:03:03,966
(Background Chatter)

71
00:03:04,515 --> 00:03:05,910
- [Boy in gray] So that's 100.

72
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:14,203
(Background Chatter)

73
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:18,957
- [Teacher] You are pouring
that so carefully Jade.

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,487
- [Both boys] Stop.

75
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,764
- [Boy in gray] Good.

76
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,556
- [Jade] Because we want
to have it exact so I

77
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:27,723
had to.

78
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,551
- [Teacher] Okay, Ashlyn.

79
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:34,551
So Jade put in 100 once,

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,748
and then she put 100 in a second time.

81
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:40,395
So how much water has
she put in there so far?

82
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:41,393
- [Ashlyn] 200.

83
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,146
- [Teacher] How did you get 200?

84
00:03:43,146 --> 00:03:44,435
- [Ashlyn] Um.

85
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:46,037
- [Teacher] Be sure you talk nice and loudly honey.

86
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:47,280
- [Ashlyn] Because,

87
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,167
I got it because...

88
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,044
100...

89
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,841
plus...

90
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:00,759
it equals 200 because
you put two in there.

91
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,920
- [Teacher] Nice!

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,675
Good job.

93
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:20,049
(Background Chatter)

94
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:21,831
- [Teacher] Looks like you're doing great kids.

95
00:04:21,831 --> 00:04:26,518
(Background Chatter)

96
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:28,513
- [Boy in gray] 60.

97
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,754
- [Ashlyn] Keep going.

98
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,516
Keep going.

99
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:35,519
- [Boy in gray] Looks like it might have been

100
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,721
slightly off.

101
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,161
Better watch it go.

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:50,931
(Background Chatter)

103
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:54,756
- [Boy in white] Okay, so,

104
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,881
maybe if we...

105
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:04,115
I think that's good but should we add the,

106
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:05,995
should I add the data in now?

107
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,719
- [Girl in white] No, we needed that,

108
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,128
did you pour on water, because

109
00:05:12,308 --> 00:05:14,235
that also (Background Chatter).

110
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:25,691
(Background Chatter)

111
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,800
- [Boy in stripes] Wow, looks like
we're getting a lot of data.

112
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:31,718
Your recharge is high.

113
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:34,208
(Background Chatter)

114
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:42,040
- [Teacher] Trial number one, why do you say

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,647
runoff had more water in trial number one?

116
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:51,120
- [Boy in white] I think because it, clay's more harder,

117
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,884
so it's kind of more difficult to

118
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,512
go through with (Background Chatter).

119
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:00,754
- [Teacher] So what is this number?

120
00:06:00,754 --> 00:06:02,159
- [Boy in white] 790.

121
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,111
- [Teacher] What is this number?

122
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:03,784
- [Boy in white] 62.

123
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:05,369
- [Teacher] And which is greater?

124
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,592
- [Boy in white] 790.

125
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:09,921
- [Teacher] Yea, 790's greater than 62.

126
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,169
Good for you, honey.

127
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,247
How did you get this number dear?

128
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,961
- [Boy in white] I think,

129
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,411
we added them up.

130
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,164
- [Teacher] What did you add up honey?

131
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:29,003
- [Boy in white] 790 and 600.

132
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,522
I mean 62.

133
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,287
- [Teacher] To get this total?

134
00:06:33,316 --> 00:06:33,792
- [Boy in white] Yeah.

135
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:34,889
- [Teacher] Great.

136
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:37,490
I have a question for this group though.

137
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,550
How much water did you pour in

138
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,927
on trial one?

139
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:43,312
1,000?

140
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,519
1,000 what?

141
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,553
- [Group] Milliliters.

142
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:47,074
- [Teacher] 1,000 milliliters?

143
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,475
But your total is only 852 milliliters.

144
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,635
- [Boy in blue] It's still in
the zone of saturation.

145
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,369
- [Teacher] Oh.

146
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:58,115
- [Boy in blue] Or it hasn't
collected off the first.

147
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,491
- [Teacher] Alright.

148
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,759
- [Boy in blue] But it's interesting maybe,

149
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,721
the water from last time,

150
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:08,715
since we only had 852 ending last time?

151
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,073
Maybe this time,

152
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:14,230
the second (Background Chatter), sort of.

153
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,807
Maybe it,

154
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:19,192
some might (Background Chatter) against the window,

155
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,201
if the water from last time,

156
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:25,032
I wonder if it came down, in the aquifer.

157
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:25,949
- [Teacher] I wonder.

158
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,842
- [Boy in blue] Maybe it's just
holding it in there.

159
00:07:27,842 --> 00:07:30,512
- [Teacher] I wonder, it'll be interesting
to measure this time.

160
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,805
So what part do you have in your lab note?

161
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:36,955
- [Girl in maroon] We're adding, we're have to

162
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:40,029
answer question two,
and then we're measuring

163
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,246
(Background Chatter).

164
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,389
"Describe what you observed
when you poured the water

165
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:48,387
over the ground water the second time.

166
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:49,394
What changed?

167
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:50,877
Taylor, you go first.

168
00:07:50,877 --> 00:07:52,451
- [Taylor] Um, well,

169
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:56,050
I think what changed is,

170
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,043
since the clay sort of got use
to the water the first time,

171
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:02,563
and there wasn't very much water

172
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,251
on the recharge water the first time,

173
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:11,597
and it got used to, the
clay got used to the water,

174
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:15,672
that there are little cracks, or the water

175
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:18,273
slipped through the sides and

176
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:21,477
it went, and now we've got more

177
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,159
recharge water than we had

178
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,883
on our first one.

179
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,677
- [Teacher] Do you think that could
happen in real life?

180
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:30,080
Do you think we could have
an impermeable surface

181
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,750
like clay, and then,

182
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,160
it could crack and let water through?

183
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,480
Why do you think that
could happen in real life?

184
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,565
Some place that might happen for real?

185
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:43,718
- [Boy in white] A bunch of pressure?

186
00:08:43,718 --> 00:08:46,679
If it rains for like, millions
and millions of years,

187
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,527
maybe like cement, or gravel?

188
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:54,691
It would break it down,

189
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:59,450
and it would have like a little.

190
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:01,197
- [Teacher] Do you remember the term for that?

191
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:01,668
- [Boy in blue] Weather rock.

192
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:02,550
- [Teacher] Yeah!

193
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,845
- [Boy in white] Weather rock.

194
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:06,393
- [Girl in maroon] Like, what's in the middle of the road?

195
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:08,382
- [Teacher] Yeah, sure, yeah.

196
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,596
- [Taylor] Because when people drive on it,

197
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:11,873
it gets so much pressure.

198
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:13,951
And people keep driving on it,

199
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,553
and it cracks sometimes.

200
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,238
- [Teacher] Sure.

201
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,914
And I'm sorry, I interrupted you when

202
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:19,882
you were answering question number two.

203
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,120
- [Boy in blue] I wonder if the, I doubt
anyone would do this,

204
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,154
but if we put pollution on clay,

205
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:29,118
- [Teacher] If you put what, honey?

206
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,409
- [Boy in blue] Pollution on like, cement of something,

207
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:35,201
I would wonder if it would get through.

208
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:39,153
Like, sort of like water sometimes,

209
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,193
and since the clay's impermeable,

210
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:45,325
water can't get through it easily,

211
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,840
but I wonder if pollution would.

212
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:50,715
- [Teacher] That's a good question,
you might want to

213
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,994
do that experiment when
you're done with this one.

214
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:55,330
That'd be great to check.

215
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,849
Good job.

216
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:02,000
- [Taylor] The clay became more
permeable the second time

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,358
we added the water?

218
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:04,688
- [Teacher] Yes.

219
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:11,276
- [Taylor] And then we
should probably measure

220
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:13,041
how much is in here.

221
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,906
- [Boy in blue] Yes.
- [Taylor] Oh, that's kind of... (Background Chatter)

222
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,717
- [Boy in blue] Yea because it's like, soapy.

223
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,792
- [Taylor] It is sort of soapy.

224
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:23,804
- [Boy in blue] I think it's because
of the clay being wet.

225
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:26,323
Look on this side.

226
00:10:27,316 --> 00:10:29,823
- [Taylor] Oh yeah, I can
see some of the white.

227
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:39,291
(Background Chatter)

228
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:41,962
- [Teacher] So why is the (Background Chatter)

229
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:43,712
about 120?

230
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,637
- [Girl in blue] Because it's not quite at 150,

231
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:49,325
but it's a little bit over 100.

232
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:52,036
- [Teacher] Is close,
close enough for this?

233
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:54,921
Or how do you know when close
is close enough for this?

234
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,760
- [Girl in white] Um, we know when it's
close enough for this,

235
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,249
because it doesn't really
have an exact measurement

236
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,714
for 120, so we know that it's

237
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:07,124
kind of half way between 150 and 100.

238
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:12,361
125 and it's just a
little bit lower than 125.

239
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:20,686
- [Christian] There's a lot more
recharge than last time.

240
00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:21,907
- [Teacher] A lot more recharge?

241
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,283
- [Christian] Yeah.

242
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:27,208
- [Girl in blue] We had 760, now we have 435.

243
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:27,956
- [Teacher] Holy cow!

244
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:32,078
The first time you did this, you had 760,

245
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:33,320
760 what?

246
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,318
- [Group] Milliliters.

247
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,159
- [Teacher] Milliliters of runoff.

248
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:39,032
- [Girl in white] And this time
we had 435 milliliters.

249
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,994
- [Teacher] Oh, that is a big change!

250
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:43,629
I wonder, I wonder what
will happen with your

251
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,081
recharge, have you measured that yet?

252
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,625
- [Boy] Yeah, what was it?

253
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:51,124
- [Girl in blue] It was, I think it was 871.

254
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:56,407
140, 371.

255
00:11:57,074 --> 00:11:57,991
- [Teacher] Oh my goodness!

256
00:11:57,991 --> 00:12:01,786
Why do you think you had
so much more recharge

257
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,552
the second time you did this?

258
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:04,121
Christian?

259
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:06,675
- [Christian] Probably because the ground probably got

260
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:09,311
more moist, so it would make it easier to

261
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,354
slip right through.

262
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:12,631
- [Teacher] Do you remember the term for that?

263
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,394
When the ground gets all wet with water?

264
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:16,346
- [Christian] Soil saturation.

265
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:17,804
- [Teacher] Great.

266
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:19,691
- [Girl in white] Well yea, I mean the water level must

267
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,472
have gotten higher.

268
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:22,517
- [Teacher] Why do you say that?

269
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:25,315
- [Girl in white] Because the bigger the saturation is,

270
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:27,718
and the higher the water table is,

271
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:29,634
the more moist the ground is.

272
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:32,160
The ground is so the water
can go through easier.

273
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,149
- [Girl in blue] I think the first time we did it,

274
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:37,761
the water went through,
which made it easier

275
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:39,201
for the second time to go through.

276
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,972
'Cause it made it more moist.

277
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:44,112
And the rock pebbles were
kind of scattered around

278
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,876
probably mixed with the water.

279
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:47,397
- [Teacher] So that's the
pattern you're seeing.

280
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:50,608
What do you predict will
happen on your third trial?

281
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,758
- [Girl in white] I'm thinking that there will be

282
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,196
maybe, maybe possibly,

283
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:59,803
more recharge than runoff.

284
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,072
- [Teacher] More recharge than runoff?

285
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,085
Did you have more recharge
than runoff the second time?

286
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,144
- [Girl in white] No, but we always have the tape on,

287
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:09,793
and it's less than 100.

288
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:12,115
- [Teacher] So they started like
this, and now they're equal,

289
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:14,193
and now you think the third time they'll,

290
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:14,750
- [Group] Yea.

291
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,529
- [Teacher] Oh.

292
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:20,517
- [Girl in blue] Because probably, since the
soil's even more moist now,

293
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:23,837
that it will make it
go through the cracks.

294
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,438
- [Teacher] And Jasper, what
did your group discuss,

295
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,632
that you observed the second time

296
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:31,279
you poured in the water that was different

297
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,132
from the first time you poured it in?

298
00:13:37,038 --> 00:13:42,038
- [Jasper] The runoff water was kind
of even with the recharge.

299
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,614
- [Teacher] But before you measured
it, before you were just

300
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:46,476
making your observations and watching,

301
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:47,968
what did you observe?

302
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:53,372
- [Jasper] That the first time, that there was

303
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,719
there was more runoff because the

304
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:59,363
dirt wasn't that moist.

305
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,170
- [Teacher] Oh.

306
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,482
Great, so that's what
you wrote down for your

307
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:05,728
number two?

308
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,600
And I have a question for you Christian.

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,479
How much water, are you the drain person?

310
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,152
- [Christian] Yeah.

311
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:17,051
- [Teacher] How much rain did you
pour in on trial number one?

312
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:19,308
- [Christian] 1,000 milliliters.

313
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:21,010
- [Teacher] So this is interesting.

314
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,802
How much did you measure
after trial number one?

315
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,969
- [Christian] 900.

316
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,120
- [Teacher] So what happened
to the rest of the water?

317
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,757
- [Christian] It stayed into the soil.

318
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:30,918
(Girls gasp)

319
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,114
- [Girl in blue] Oh!

320
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:34,489
So that's why the soil's all wet.

321
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:36,514
'Cause there's still water underneath it.

322
00:14:36,514 --> 00:14:38,279
- [Christian] So it's like
100 milliliters there's about

323
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,264
100 milliliters left in here.

324
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:41,760
- [Teacher] How did you get 100?

325
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
- [Christian] Because 900 plus 100 equals 1,000.

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,562
- [Teacher] Good job!

327
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,681
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

328
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:50,090
(Background Chatter)

329
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:54,084
- [Girl in white] Four three five, would equal...

330
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:55,703
806.

331
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:59,120
Okay, we need to have less
water than the last time.
