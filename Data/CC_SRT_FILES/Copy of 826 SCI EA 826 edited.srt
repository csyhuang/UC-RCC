1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,526
- We are now getting into Earth,
Sun, and Moon interactions.

2
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,056
We have done one thing,

3
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:09,450
well, we have done several things,

4
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,282
all year, on that first slide,

5
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:14,024
which you copied onto your board.

6
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:15,366
What is it?

7
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:18,061
- The moon phases.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,171
- The moon phases.

9
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,773
You do the moon phases every day.

10
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:23,727
So, you should be pretty familiar

11
00:00:23,727 --> 00:00:26,229
with moon phases, what they are,

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,317
how they happen, all that good stuff.

13
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:31,523
We get to move on.

14
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:33,915
Okay.

15
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,281
Let’s start with something you do know.

16
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:39,882
What is a moon phase?

17
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:41,252
Tom.

18
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:45,112
- It’s what, well, it’s technically,

19
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,203
when you look up in the sky,

20
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:48,636
and, like, what light you
see in the moon.

21
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:49,959
- Good.

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,561
What light you see in the moon.

23
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,324
Where does the light come from?

24
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:56,971
The green she’s reflecting.

25
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:58,225
- The sun?

26
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,270
- The sun.

27
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,663
How does that work?

28
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,935
- The sun shines on the moon
and reflects back.

29
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,347
- Good, the sun shines on
the moon and reflects back.

30
00:01:08,347 --> 00:01:10,199
So, that’s how we see the moon.

31
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,358
Do you agree with that?

32
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:15,864
I see most of you agree.

33
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:16,671
Good.

34
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:17,809
Okay.

35
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:22,411
Then, if we know that
it comes from the sun,

36
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:24,728
why don’t you tell me some of

37
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:29,372
the moon phases, so we can
build on what you just told me.

38
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:30,885
What are some of the moon phases?

39
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,091
This one should be easy.

40
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,228
- Waxing crescent.

41
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:34,918
- Waxing crescent, excellent.

42
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:37,913
Aisha?

43
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,987
- Waxing gibbous.

44
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:40,606
- Waxing gibbous, very good.

45
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:41,471
Grillen?

46
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:42,423
- Waning crescent.

47
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:43,259
- Waning crescent. Bailey?

48
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,304
- Full moon.

49
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:45,691
- Full moon. Tom?

50
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,694
- Waning gibbous.

51
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:50,103
- Waning gibbous. Ramos?

52
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:53,587
- 1st quarter.

53
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:54,998
- 1st quarter, excellent.

54
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:56,160
- New moon.

55
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,479
- New moon, excellent.

56
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:58,598
- Last quarter.

57
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,638
- Last quarter.

58
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,752
- Third quarter.

59
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,731
- Third quarter and last quarter, very good.

60
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,798
When we talked in the last class,

61
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:06,557
some of you said, “Second quarter!”

62
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:09,674
Then, the second quarter is half time,

63
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,224
so, that would be what moon phase?

64
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:15,682
[Inaudible]

65
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,144
What’s halfway in between first and third?

66
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:21,021
[laughter]

67
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:22,533
What moon phase is that?

68
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,364
[Inaudible]

69
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:25,734
- Full moon?

70
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,241
- Yay, full moon, yay!

71
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:29,843
[laughter]

72
00:02:29,895 --> 00:02:31,637
Yeah, just start spouting everything out,

73
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:33,512
and then, eventually, you’ll be right.

74
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:34,719
That works for me.

75
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:36,112
Yeah, it’s a full moon.

76
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,085
Get it, half, full?

77
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:42,111
Or not, okay.

78
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:44,921
So, we have all these moon phases.

79
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:48,334
How can you tell which one’s which?

80
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,584
Why don’t you just look up and say,

81
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,627
“Yay, it’s a fingernail!”

82
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,131
How do you tell which one’s which?

83
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:57,684
- Because different
moon phases look different.

84
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,123
- How does it look different?

85
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,197
- Because--

86
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:01,074
- It’s okay.

87
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,558
- Because different parts of the moon

88
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:06,071
have light on it, in different amounts.

89
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,441
- Okay, different parts of the moon have

90
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,270
different amounts of light on it.

91
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,870
How would I be able to
tell a waxing something

92
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,709
from a waning something?

93
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:16,231
[Inaudible]

94
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:17,874
You’re almost, almost there.

95
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:19,933
Yeah?

96
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:21,349
[student laughs]

97
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,369
[Inaudible]

98
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:26,463
- I think you will because the moon

99
00:03:26,463 --> 00:03:28,570
has different kinds of faces.

100
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,356
- Good, very good.

101
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:32,663
Different kinds of faces.

102
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:33,962
- One lights up on the left side

103
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:35,977
and the other lights up on the right side.

104
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:38,578
- Which one lights up on the right side?

105
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,064
- The waxing.

106
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,480
- How do you know that?

107
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,891
- Because, um...

108
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:51,038
Well, you always told us it’s
light on the right, it’s wax-iting.

109
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:54,707
- Yeah, it’s light on
the right, it’s wax-iting!

110
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:56,565
Or, what you guys like to do...

111
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:01,208
- Wax on, wane off.

112
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:02,486
- Or, wane off.

113
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:04,575
I don’t know, wax on.

114
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,342
Okay?

115
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:07,339
So, I don’t have a problem,

116
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,126
I don’t think that you have a problem

117
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,403
knowing the different phases of the moon.

118
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:13,399
I think you guys are pretty set on that.

119
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:16,324
How about what causes

120
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,529
the phases of the moon?

121
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:22,042
What makes that happen?

122
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,227
You’ve already told me

123
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:26,517
light reflecting off the
moon that comes from the sun,

124
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:29,002
but, why would you have

125
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,329
parts?

126
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:32,421
Why wouldn’t you just be able to see

127
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:33,628
the whole thing, all the time?

128
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:34,324
Sean.

129
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,718
- Because the earth blocks out

130
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,784
some of the light that’s
coming from the moon.

131
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:38,875
- Okay, good.

132
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:39,572
Brenda?

133
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,802
- Because the earth rotates with time,

134
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,527
and when the earth rotates,

135
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:48,181
the earth blocks the sun,

136
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:51,766
so you can see, maybe,
at the top of the moon.

137
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:52,944
- Okay, good.

138
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,711
Tom?

139
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:57,245
- There are other stars
shining in different directions,

140
00:04:57,245 --> 00:04:58,935
not just the sun.

141
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:00,305
- Okay, very good.

142
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,516
Stars shining at different directions.

143
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:03,671
Anything else?

144
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:07,061
Nancy.

145
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:11,102
- Because the moon is moving,

146
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:14,259
and so [Inaudible]

147
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,162
- Okay, as the moon moves,
we see different phases.

148
00:05:17,237 --> 00:05:19,530
So, I hear a lot of

149
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,477
that the earth blocks the moon,

150
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,358
the sun from reaching the moon.

151
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:26,891
Are you in agreeance?

152
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:27,894
- Yeah.

153
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,934
- A little bit.

154
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,332
- Yeah, yeah, somewhat?

155
00:05:30,332 --> 00:05:31,168
Okay.

156
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:32,352
Here’s what we’re gonna do.

157
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:35,296
You have won the experiment.

158
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,484
You’ve done the flip camera.

159
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,922
But, what I want you to do,
on your table,

160
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,237
everybody has, like a big lollipop.

161
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:45,889
You either have the blue styrofoam ball,

162
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,514
you have the big, white styrofoam ball,

163
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,413
you have a little styrofoam ball.

164
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,062
I want you,

165
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,157
each person in your group to have

166
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:54,312
one of those styrofoam balls.

167
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:55,542
Okay?

168
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,869
And then, you are going to come this way--

169
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:01,579
- Down in your light paths?

170
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:06,270
- You are gonna come up front,

171
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:07,918

down, if you’re near the front.

Oh, [Inaudible]

Okay, what I want you to do,

184

and you’re already doing it,

185

hold it out in front of you,

186
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:42,225
I want you to look at your moon.

187
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:44,691
What am I holding in my left hand?

188
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:47,732
- The sun.

189
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:49,596
- The light bulb, the sun.

190
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:51,081
You have the moon, yay.

191
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,446
Here, hold it out in front of you.

192
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:55,418
What moon phase do you have on your moon?

193

Aisha?

194
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:57,955
- New moon.

195
00:06:57,955 --> 00:06:58,883
- New moon.

196
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:00,178
Why is it a new moon?

197
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:04,735
- Because you can’t see any light.

198
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:05,572
- You can’t see any light.

199
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:06,937
I can see lots of light.

200
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,352
It’s blinding me.

201
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:11,023
Oh, there we go.

202
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:14,512
But, there’s a light source.

203
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,433
Isn’t my moon illuminated?

204
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,132
Becky?

205
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,012
- It’s illuminated
on one side, but since

206
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:25,287
you’re behind it, you don’t
see any of the light coming--

207
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:27,046
- Well, then, how do I
know it’s illuminated?

208
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:31,318
- Because you can see other light?

209
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,432
- Oh!

210
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:35,102
So, I look across from me, and I see Sean.

211
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:37,147
Sean, you have a full moon.

212

Now, you’re supposed to disagree with me,

00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:46,932
and tell me that no, you don’t.

215
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:47,949
- Oh, okay.

216
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,156
Um...

217
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:51,246
- What moon do you have?

218
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,226
- A new moon.

219
00:07:52,226 --> 00:07:53,660
- No, you don’t, you have a full moon.

220

222

- No, he doesn’t, he has a full moon.

223
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:03,510
[Inaudible]

224
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,061
You all are crazy.

225
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:06,501
Look.

226
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,502
[laughter]

227
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:12,165
It’s illuminated on the other side.

228
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,396
[laughter]

229
00:08:15,724 --> 00:08:16,647
Okay.

230
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:19,741
Oh, yeah, you could do that.

231
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,081
But then, wouldn’t your head
be in line with the earth?

232
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,981
[Inaudible]

233
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,140
It doesn’t make any sense.

234
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:29,790
[Inaudible]

235
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:33,579
But, that is one way
that we can figure out

236
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,222
that the moon is illuminated.

237
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,062
Not that we have 15 different moons,

238
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,803
or 28, or however many people we have.

239
00:08:39,803 --> 00:08:42,375
But, just because we’re
looking at a new moon,

240
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:44,423
doesn’t mean that the
moon’s not illuminated,

241
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,695
it’s just the other side.

242
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:50,023
So, I look across, and I can
see full moon across from me.

243
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:53,186
What else can you see,
from where you’re standing?

244
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:55,990
Tell me what you see
and where you see it.

245
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:57,714
Yes.

246
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:00,036
- Over there, with Zack and Sarah,

247
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,267
I see fullmoon.

248
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,467
- Okay, good.

249
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:06,091
- Over there, I see a waning gibbous.

250
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:07,304
- Really?

251
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:09,875
I see a waxing gibbous.

252
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,647
Uh, Becky.

253
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:16,196
- I see a full moon, over at Zack.

254
00:09:16,479 --> 00:09:17,635
- Nice.

255
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:21,234
- I see a waxing gibbous with Charlese.

256
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,083
- I see a full moon.

257
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,267
- Well, I see a waxing gibbous.

258
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:26,038
- Why?

259
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,895
Why do you see a waxing
gibbous, and I see a full moon?

260
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:29,356
- Because we’re in different places.

261
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:30,999
- What’s that got to do with anything?

262

[laughter]

263
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,085
I thought y'all told me
that we saw moon phases

264
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:41,936
because the Earth's shadow blocks

265
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,557
the sunlight from reaching the moon.

266
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,481
How can we see moon phases then?

267
00:09:47,695 --> 00:09:48,803

268
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,092

270
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,860
- Line of sight.

271
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,033
- Line of sight?

272
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,205
What does that mean?

273
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:55,705
- Um...

274
00:09:55,705 --> 00:09:59,088
- Besides, your sight in a line.

275
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:00,574
[nervous laughter]

276
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:02,756
- It's, um, well...

277
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,085
Because sunlight's here,

278
00:10:04,085 --> 00:10:05,200
it looks like a new moon,

279
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,118
but if the sunlight were,
like over there, it wouldn't.

280
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:10,720
- Huh?

281
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:12,064
Interesting.

Brooke.

283
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:14,461
- Well, I'm just suspecting
that Lauren turns

284
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:16,087
kind of the moon out of view

285
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:18,084
then, like I couldn't see a shadow

286
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,677
I could only see the new moon.

287
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:26,353
- Oh, because, oh, well, oh
Lauren's head is in the way.

- Look at if the
Earth was in the way that.

290
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,339
- If the Earth was in the way,
would that cause a moon phase?

291
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:34,748
- Yeah.

292
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:38,927
- Is the Earth in the way
of the moon all the time?

293
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:40,437
- No.

294
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:41,649
- What could we call...

295
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:42,944
Sorry.

we have the Earth and the moon

299
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,698
and the sun lined up,

300
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,715
or if the moon is blocking
light from getting to the Earth,

301
00:10:55,743 --> 00:10:58,942
or if the Earth is blocking
light from getting to the moon?

Just a little bit.

between the moon and the sun?

- No.

[nervous laughter]

There's nothing in between
me and the light source,

00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,701
yet all around you're saying
you see different moon phases.

00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,606
Correct?

324
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:43,086
- Mmm hmm.

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:43,928
- Mmm hmm.

326
00:11:43,928 --> 00:11:45,019
I want you to think about that.

327
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,216
Why you can see different
phases on my styrofoam ball,

328
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:51,538
but there's nothing in between us.

329
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:55,241
- Because the moon and the earth

330
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:57,308
is at a different angle.

331

00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:14,823
I know there was at least
one group in the last class

00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:16,582
that blew a light bulb.

[giggling]

342
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:19,165
So, you might have to share,

343
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:21,579
but I'm gonna have you
go back to your seats.

344
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,042
Some of you have three people.

345
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,319
Some of you have four people.

Some of you have two.

Daniel, you have three now.

00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:29,977
I want you to set yourselves up

349
00:12:30,586 --> 00:12:33,738
in an arrangement around
your light bulb,

350
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,918
where you personally can see

351
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:39,286
four different moon phases,

352
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,777
or three different moon phases,

353
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:43,001
depending on how many
people are in your group.

354
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,295
So, you need to be able to see,

356

You don't have to fill anything.

- Alright, move Michael.

- Where do you think it's gonna be?

- Put it like this.

00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:25,568
Okay.

372
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,836
- It doesn't have a switch.

373
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,269
It's just automatically on and off.

374

- Are we getting there?

378
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:36,974
- Okay.

379
00:13:36,974 --> 00:13:38,577
- Okay, since you have four people,

380
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:39,738
you're going to position yourselves

381
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:41,157
differently than they are.

382
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:42,568
They only have three.

383
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,804
So, you're gonna think,

384
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,447
think about a clock.

385
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,868
Where on the clock will
you put everybody,

386
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,299
so you can all see four
different moon phases,

387
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:52,629
from your angle.

388
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,928
- Well, one can go at twelve.

389
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:58,637
- Twelve, twelve, six, and nine and three.

390
00:13:58,643 --> 00:13:59,961
- Like a cross.

391
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,033
- Do it.

392
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,222
- I don't think we can put
anybody over there.

393
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:04,800
- And then, tell me when you get it.

394
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,163
- We can't put anybody over there.

395
00:14:06,173 --> 00:14:07,754
So, that'll be like twelve,

396
00:14:07,754 --> 00:14:08,404
this'll be like...

397
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:10,163
- Well, we need a camera for it.

398
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:11,864
- Right there, we're not using a camera.

399
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:12,376
- Okay.

400
00:14:12,376 --> 00:14:13,420
- Well, now...

401
00:14:13,843 --> 00:14:15,120
- So Brenda can stand there,

402
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,291
Brooke can..

403
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:19,146
- Or, we can do, like, um,

00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,116
She's sitting at four.

00:15:24,116 --> 00:15:25,387
- On a clock.

435

- She's nine.

She's three, and six and twelve.

- Good.

00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,907

twelve, three, six, nine.

440

You can do it that way.

441
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,713
Or, you could actually scoot yourselves

442
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:45,107
a little differently,

443
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:47,708

see [clicks tongue] half.

509
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,566
but it's an eclipse of the moon

510
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:35,497
it goes, like, all red or something,

511
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,955
we had it this year,

512
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:40,182
and the Arth, Earth, arth...

513
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,393
The Earth is blocking it in a way worse.

514
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:44,872
- Okay, so is that going to

515
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,659
change the phase of the moon,

516
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:49,818
nightly?

517
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:50,764
Becky.

518
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:51,299
- No.

519
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,548
- She says no.

520
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:54,386
Do you agree?

521
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:58,217
So what changes the phase of the moon?

522
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:00,353
Ben?

523
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:02,675
- The way we see it from Earth.

524
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:04,964
- The way we see it from Earth.

525
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:06,613
Agree?

526
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,494
- Yes.

527
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,537
- Ah, interesting.

528
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,491
Now, when you did

529
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,184
the experiment before,

530
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:16,879
when you did it with a flip camera,

531
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,458
we're gonna re-watch

532
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,874
some of those videos.

533
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:21,109
I'm just gonna do the montage,

534
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,216
so it's not necessarily gonna be

535
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:24,772
your entire class,

536
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,374
but we're gonna go through,

537
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:28,599
and you need to critique each one.

538
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,899
You need to figure out

539
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,194
do they do something wrong?

540
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:32,906
Do they do something correct?

541
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:35,172
Do you need to do something with that?

542
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,395
Do you need to re-think
your flip camera video?

543
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,601
Because, we're gonna do it again

544
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,290
after we get finished with this.

545
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,567
Make sense?

546
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,072
Are you sure?

547
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:45,978
- Mmm hmm.

548
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:46,837
- Are you positive?

549
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:47,784
- Mmm hmm.

550
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:57,188
- Let's watch the first one.

551
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,456
[chair screeching]

552
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,183
Okay.

553
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:10,547
Let me play it for you again.

554
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,620
See the phases?

555
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,914
- Yeah.

556
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:30,526
[giggling]

557
00:20:30,526 --> 00:20:31,478
- Alright, now.

558
00:20:31,478 --> 00:20:32,802
I want you to tell me.

559
00:20:33,322 --> 00:20:34,845
Besides being blinded.

560
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:40,668
What did they do correct?

561
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:42,270
What was right?

562
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:45,869
- They were in a orbit
not around the sun,

563
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,677
just a orbit.

564
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:50,489
- Excellent, they were not
orbiting around the sun,

565
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,974
a.k.a. the lightbulb.

566
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,454
What did they do incorrect?

567
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:02,676
- They didn't call out the phases.

568
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:04,836
- Okay, they didn't call out the phases.

569
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,503
- They didn't orbit, orbit the camera.

570
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:10,752
- They did.

571
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:12,859
The camera was in the middle.

572
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,531
So, it went around.

573
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,595
So, that's okay.

574
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:16,872
Think about that.

575
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,910
They went around.

576
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,115
There's even something wrong...
