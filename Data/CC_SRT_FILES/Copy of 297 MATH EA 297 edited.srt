- Stationary point.  Did he move?

2
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:03,683
Okay, some of the other groups are

3
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:04,820
moving their fingers around,

4
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,862
sometimes they were releasing
from up here and up here,

5
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:10,114
so do you think your data might
be a little more realistic?

6
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:10,797
- Yeah.

7
00:00:10,797 --> 00:00:13,359
- Yeah, okay so, now one thing,

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,263
what type of formation do you guys have?

9
00:00:15,263 --> 00:00:16,200
[Inaudible]

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,444
- Good. Put an adjective in front of it.

11
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:20,394
- Extremely strong.

12
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,089
- Strong. A strong positive.

13
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,784
Do you think every
correlation around here

14
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:24,968
is gonna be the same?

15
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,184
- No.
- No.

16
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:27,232
- Okay, so yours is probably going to be

17
00:00:27,232 --> 00:00:28,370
one of the strongest ones.

18
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,111
Remember that correlation coefficient?

19
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:33,710
- R, it went from positive
one to negative one or zero?

20
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,894
- Oh yeah.
- What do you think

21
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:36,044
yours would be close to?

22
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:36,755
- One.

23
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:37,475
- It'd be really close to--

24
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:40,394
Then we'll get to that
shortly guys, later on. Okay?

25
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:43,320
- So you probably would have
one that's a decimal 999

26
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,411
or really close.

27
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,081
- Okay, so you're trying
to find your slope?

28
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:47,865
- Yeah.

29
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:49,741
- So what is your slope?

30
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,453
- Two.

31
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:52,951
- Two, okay, so over
here we're gonna put--

32
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:56,114
And now, does everyone
have the exact same?

33
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:56,857
- You do?
- Pretty much.

34
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,898
- Oh, most groups who are
four people are slightly off

35
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:01,593
depending on where
you put the line.

36
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:03,817
Okay, here's the slope.

37
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,605
So you just told me
your slope is two,

38
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:06,669
now what am I asking you to do?

39
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:07,574
What is your--

40
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:08,137
[Background Chatter]

41
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:09,497
- No, we're not done yet.

42
00:01:09,497 --> 00:01:10,914
What is your--

43
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:11,968
- It's 2.0.

44
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:12,908
- Read the question.

45
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:14,835
[Background Chatter]

46
00:01:14,835 --> 00:01:17,201
- Okay, what's the slope of the equation?

47
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,055
The slope is--

48
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:20,046
What did you just tell me?

49
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,018
- Oh, two.

50
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:25,154
- Two.  Okay now, what's the
real-world meaning of that?

51
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,405
What does that mean when
you say yes, those are two.

52
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:37,877
- Okay now, we can go back to that,

53
00:01:37,877 --> 00:01:40,013
I just want to talk to
you about the solution.

54
00:01:40,013 --> 00:01:42,381
Just on your slope,
you said it was two.

55
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:43,449
That was perfect.

56
00:01:43,449 --> 00:01:45,672
But now, what's the
real-world meaning?

57
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:49,314
- So the slope is the
more rubber band...

58
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:51,040
- What are you looking at?

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,138
[Background Chatter]

60
00:01:56,518 --> 00:01:58,474
- So it's one and two...

61
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,937
- One.

62
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:03,049
[Background Chatter]

63
00:02:13,105 --> 00:02:15,169
- Why can't it?

64
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:18,566
- So you want to put five? Okay.

65
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:24,433
Ten over. Okay, so now you're
telling me your slope is,

66
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:25,608
ten over one.

67
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:26,837
10?

68
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:33,177
[Background Chatter]

69
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:38,356
Okay, well I'm asking
you what's your slope.

70
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,121
Now you're saying your slope is 10.

71
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:43,372
That's what the slope is but
I want the real-world meaning.

72
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,109
So what were you saying?

73
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,689
- For every one rubber
band that drops...

74
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:53,582
- How do you know?
How do you know--

75
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:55,360
But where are you getting...

76
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,844
I need a little more detail though.

77
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:00,214
It's dropping what?

78
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:02,977
10, 10 centimeters.

79
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:06,019
So, 10 centimeters for every?

80
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,846
- One.

81
00:03:06,846 --> 00:03:08,142
- One rubber band.

82
00:03:08,142 --> 00:03:10,683
Okay. Now, what's your y-intercept?

83
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:12,076
- Seven.

84
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:14,367
- Seven. Now is your y-intercept

85
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:15,642
directions to get somewhere else

86
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:18,449
or is it telling the exact location?

87
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,877
What's the y-intercept?

88
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:22,317
Because a slope, isn't that directions

89
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,408
to get somewhere else?

90
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:24,923
What's the y-intercept?

91
00:03:27,023 --> 00:03:29,820
I want the entire--
It's zero seven.

92
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,410
So can you write
zero seven down please?

93
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,732
Write zero seven down.

94
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:36,800
And now, tell me what the real--

95
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,190
When I ask you what the
y-intercept is, yes, zero seven.

96
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,907
Now what's the real-world meaning.

97
00:03:44,117 --> 00:03:48,776
- ...subtract out of seven...

98
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:51,412
- So what's this saying?

99
00:03:51,412 --> 00:03:52,282
Translate that for me.

100
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,513
You're saying there's
no real-world meaning,

101
00:03:53,513 --> 00:03:54,698
what's that saying?

102
00:03:54,698 --> 00:03:56,948
[Background Chatter]

103
00:03:56,948 --> 00:04:01,264
- So, before we put any
rubber bands on,

104
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,423
this already moves
seven centimeters.

105
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:05,278
What does that mean?

106
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,270
Going into this lab, did I
know if the real-world meaning

107
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,092
was gonna make sense or not.

108
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:13,116
There's been a few groups
today their

109
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:16,748
y-intercept has a real-world meaning
- zero zero.

110
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,954
But did I know where
your line was gonna go?

111
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,115
No. But if it went straight through zero

112
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,160
would that make sense?

113
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,249
Zero rubber band?

114
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:25,059
So--

115
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:26,941
- So what's the real-world meaning?

116
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:27,950
- Well, what do you think?

117
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,291
This y-intercept that you had,

118
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,435
does it have a real-world meaning?

119
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:31,992
No.

120
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,720
So yeah, it doesn't have
a real-world meaning.

121
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,234
What slope did it?

122
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,881
Okay.

123
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,022
Once again, did I know that coming in?

124
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:41,557
Depended on your data.

125
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,791
Good job.

126
00:04:43,791 --> 00:05:10,344
[Background Chatter]

127
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,440
- Guys, you're asking If
you plug into this,

128
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,799
four times three, that's 12.

129
00:05:24,146 --> 00:05:28,241
- But yeah.

130
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:38,190
Three, two and four.

131
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,930
I think it says three. Okay?

132
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,464
So what's your equation... 

133
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:55,110
Y equals 3x plus 12? Okay
so let's talk about that.

134
00:05:57,284 --> 00:06:01,067
- No, no it's one,
intercept the y... 

135
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:06,552
- It really doesn't play
out with that algorithm.

136
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:09,464
- It makes no absolute
sense whatsoever.

137
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,644
[Background Chatter]

138
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:13,116
- Yeah but you find air.

139
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:14,882
- Oh that makes sense.

140
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,102
- But this...

141
00:06:16,102 --> 00:06:18,503
- What are we talking about?

142
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:25,463
- We got one anyway,
but really that's it.

143
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:28,276
- Wait one second,
backtrack for one second.

144
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:30,409
So, what did you say here?

145
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,592
- Five-thirds.

146
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,918
- What is a five-thirds?  5/3.

147
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,451
Okay, so what's the real-world meaning?

148
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,381
- Every five inches there is three
rubber band.

149
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:42,048
- Okay. So now does the
ball go on a rubber band?

150
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,999
So flip that around
so you're saying

151
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:47,110
two rubber bands,
the figure is going--

152
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,946
- Yes.

153
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:50,437
- Okay, does that have
real-world meaning?

154
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:51,493
Does that have real-world meaning?

- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay,

156
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,001
Now you're saying what,

157
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,821
your y-intercept is--

158
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:57,288
can I see your graph
paper for a second?

159
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:58,332
- Yeah.

160
00:06:58,332 --> 00:07:00,700
- Okay. So yeah, it looks
like it's around--

- No.

163

- Do you think everyone's
gonna get the exact same line?

- We didn't really have
an intercept slope,

00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,291
- Yeah, which sounds great because

167
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,263
you're all gonna draw that
line slightly different,

168
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,006
so go with one then.

169
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:15,384
- What does that y-intercept--

170
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,944
Is that directions
or is that a location?

171
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:21,756
It's a location, isn't it?

172
00:07:21,756 --> 00:07:23,170
So can you write the exact location?

173
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,086
Because you're only counting one.

174
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:27,027
What's the order of pairs here?

175
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:31,996
You have a pair of zero
one, so write that down.

176
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:36,267
- Pair of zero ones.

177
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:38,462
You have a pair of zero ones.

178
00:07:38,462 --> 00:07:39,910
- Yeah.

179
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,589
- What's zero represent?

180
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,772
- Zero rubber bands.

181
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:44,816
- Zero rubber bands.

182
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,651
So when zero rubber
bands were attached,

183
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:47,928
how far did that--

184
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:48,926
- One.

185
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,348
- One inch.

186
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,002
Does that make sense to you?

187
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:03,751
So when there's zero
rubber bands attached,

188
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:06,886
you figure out one inch?

189
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:12,848
Alright, let's demonstrate that.

190
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:16,296
Let's see. Can I see
that for one sec please?

191
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:19,542
Okay, let's go back to
before we started.

192
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:23,571
Zero rubber bands
attached, what's happening.

193
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,688
Okay, what's happening right now.

194
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:31,686
Zero rubber bands--

195
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:33,089
Did he already move one inch?

196
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,831
- No.

197
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:37,630
- So, Does the y-intercept come in?

198
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,032
- No.
- No.

199
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:43,064
- You said...

200
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:51,008
[Background Chatter]

201
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:54,334
- Because you just told me

202
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,726
it was five inches of three.

203
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,177
Yeah. What are we discussing now?

204
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:04,704
The data, or the equation for the...

205
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:08,758
Okay? Now so, does this
y-intercept make sense?

206
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:09,439
- No.
- Zero rubber bands

207
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:11,381
are removed. So does the y-intercept

208
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:12,519
have real-world meaning?

209
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,642
- No.

210
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,282
- Does the slope have real-world meaning?

211
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:16,756
- Yeah.

212
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,647
- Did I know your
y-intercept wasn't gonna have

213
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,197
real-world meaning?

214
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:20,633
- Yes.

215
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,193
- No, because there's some people today

216
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:24,143
that actually have real-world meaning.

217
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,775
What would be a y-intercept
if it made sense?

218
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:27,564
- Zero zero.

219
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:29,282
- Zero zero. Zero rubber bands equals--

220
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:31,419
- Zero inches.
- Zero inches.

221
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:45,663
- What were you saying your slope was?

222
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,583
So let's discuss three.

223
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:53,668
The slope is three, what's
the real-world meaning?

224
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:54,703
- How many rubber bands would you

225
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,375
need in your description?

226
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,554
- Grabbing one rubber band,

227
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,983
does that make sense?

228
00:10:01,144 --> 00:10:05,713
Okay, now, so now what anout your
y-intercept would be at 12.

229
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:08,409
Now you gotta figure...

230
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:14,987
Let's discuss this right here.

231
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:18,191
[Background Chatter]

232
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,225
Now, I think you're thinking ahead.

233
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,786
But this line looks like
it's crossing up here to--

234
00:10:30,776 --> 00:10:32,743
Where is it crossing?

235
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:38,340
It's crossing at--

236
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,850
We're going up three,
look, three, six, seven.

237
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,417
Yeah I was looking like around four.

238
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,537
So let's discuss this.
You have six?

239
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:50,232
That could be perfect,

240
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,484
but we know the exact
way a line likes to go.

241
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,580
Let's go with Monique, six.

242
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,672
What's that saying?

243
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,261
Let's go to a pair,
to the y-intercept.

244
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,738
Zero pair, zero six.
So what does that mean?

245
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:10,736
So write that down, zero pair, zero six

246
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,438
for the y-intercept.

247
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:17,891
And what's that actually mean?

248
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:22,935
- Zero rubber bands in front of the six

249
00:11:22,935 --> 00:11:25,094
equals how many inches.

250
00:11:25,094 --> 00:11:26,835
- So, this was the figure.

251
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:28,066
Zero rubber bands attached,

252
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,527
does that make it already
move six inches?

253
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,939
Does that make any sense at all?

254
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:37,048
So does the y-intercept
have real-world meaning?

255
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:39,508
Could it still have
real-world meaning?

256
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,458
You were thinking ahead I think,

257
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,804
when you drew your line.

258
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:45,196
Because what's the only
y-intercept that makes sense here?

259
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:46,751
Zero rubber bands--

260
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:49,002
- 81 inches.

261
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,210
- But you didn't move.

262
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,091
But does that mean you
can decide I want to

263
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,414
make real-world meaning and just

264
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,497
draw my line down the zero?

265
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:57,869
Because what am I looking for?

266
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,853
The equation for the line of--

267
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:04,752
Is yours the equation for
the line now?

268
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:06,677
Your y-intercept makes sense,

269
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:09,231
If you knew the equation
for the y-intercept.

270
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:11,924
- You plug in 81 inches for X right?

271
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:26,482
- Did you end up with a negative?

272
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:27,991
[Background Chatter]

273
00:12:27,991 --> 00:12:30,222
[Background Chatter]

274
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:31,473
- You're fine.

275
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:32,494
You what?

276
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:33,455
[Background Chatter]

277
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:34,769
- Minus what? Oh, minus one.

278
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:36,745
I wanna discuss it.

279
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:40,316
If you're y-intercept is...

280
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,999
What's the order of pairs...?

281
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:56,469
Zero, negative one, so what's
the real-world meaning?

282
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:59,394
[Background Chatter]

283
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,395
[Background Chatter]

284
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:13,574
What's that mean?

285
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:15,765
What's the zero represent?

286
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:19,140
[Background Chatter]

287
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,942
Okay, so zero rubber bands,

288
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,939
what's your y-interception?

289
00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:25,957
At zero rubber bands,
how far does it go now?

290
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:28,218
- Negative one

291
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,218
- Did he already go one,

292
00:13:31,218 --> 00:13:32,826
or did he reach it?

293
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,076
So does that make sense?

294
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:38,269
Zero rubber bands and
he's already traveled one?

295
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:44,512
Does that make any sense?
So does the y-intercept?

296
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,110
Does that mean your y-intercept

297
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,619
just didn't end up happening?

298
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,036
- Yeah.

299
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:54,468
- When you know how to
use this it works,

300
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:57,922
[Background Chatter]

301
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,200
With zero rubber bands,
how fast are you going?

302
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,454
Zero? Zero.

303
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:05,405
Okay, does that mean
your data's all wrong?

304
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,587
No, that's the way
your numbers work.

305
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:10,722
Could you slope this out
instead three?

306
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,277
What's that mean?

307
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:15,667
Three, three what?

308
00:14:25,617 --> 00:14:28,699
Four is still, Five is...

309
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,351
So three...

310
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:34,813
Three what?

311
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,973
Let's go and do number five.

312
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:41,683
Distance, so what would
your distance be?

313
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:46,153
Inches. So it's like
three inches is over one--

314
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:48,143
So that makes sense.

315
00:14:48,143 --> 00:14:49,640
So, does your slope
have real-world meaning?

316
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,574
- Yeah.

317
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:58,334
Okay.
