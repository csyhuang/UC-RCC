00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,550
- [Instructor] Okay. What was this Animoto
video telling us? Can someone raise

3
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,600
their hand and... Yes, Brandy.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,820
- [Brandy] Telling you not to plagiarize.

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,670
- [Instructor] Telling you not to
plagiarize. Very good. So, if that's what

6
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,470
you were thinking, you are thinking about
what we're going to talk about today,

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,030
which is plagiarism. Now, I'm going to go
on the internet right now and we're going

8
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,570
to look at the definition of plagiarism.
Well, actually, we're going to look at the

9
00:00:52,570 --> 00:01:01,490
definition for plagiarize, which is "to
steal and pass-off as your own." So, you

10
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:07,010
can think of internet plagiarism as equal
to...

11
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,420
- [students] Cheating.

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,050
- [Instructor] Cheating, and that is
considered...

13
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,870
- [students] Academic misconduct.

14
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,000
- [Instructor] Academic misconduct, and
that's when you get in big trouble

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,020
sometimes. Now, we're going to watch a
TeacherTube video about plagiarism. So,

16
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,550
you will be using your worksheet, and
we're going to hear a story about this kid

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:37,050
named Billy, and you've got some bubbles
here. So, right here in the central box is

18
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,230
what you're going to write down-- you're
going to write in this box, and you can't

19
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,510
write anything yet because nothing's
happened so far, but you're going to write

20
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:48,990
about what Billy did. And in the little
circles right here you're going to write

21
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:57,588
the causes, why it probably happened, and
you're going to predict what happens to

22
00:01:57,588 --> 00:02:02,488
Billy. So, we're going to start right now
so I want everybody to listen carefully.

23
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:12,792
Here we go.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,270
- [Mr. Harris] Mrs. Calstad

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,320
- [Mrs. Calstad] Hey Mr. Harris.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,420
- I have to show you this research report
by Billy. He did it on horses. It sounds

27
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,307
really good. The pictures are good, too.

28
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:30,500
- Oh, I love horses, let me see it. Wow,
Mr. Harris, this is really good.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,830
- I told you it was.

30
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,130
- But you know what, it kind of sounds
familiar. I've seen a lot of students

31
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,730
looking at this website called
allhorses.info, and I think it's some of

32
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,560
this exact same information. I think we
should check it out.

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,750
- Let's pull it up.
- Sure.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,242
- Here's the website, Mr. Harris, and it
says right here, "The horse has been one

35
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:55,242
of the most popular domesticated animals
for centuries." What does Billy's report

36
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,106
say?

37
00:02:56,106 --> 00:03:00,746
- "The horse has been one of the most
popular domesticated animals for

38
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,770
centuries."

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,870
- So, it's the exact same sentence? That's
not good.

40
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,740
- That's not good. That's cheating.

41
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,440
- And look at that picture, too. It's the
exact same photo.

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,800
- That is the exact same photo.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,458
- Did Billy give credit to his sources
anywhere on that page?

44
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,830
- No. I don't see it anywhere.

45
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,040
- No. Well, that's a pretty serious thing.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,890
- I've heard of students in college being
expelled for that.

47
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,080
- Really?
- Yes.

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,670
- I think they call it plagiarism when you
copy someone else's work and don't give

49
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,030
them credit, and that's a shame, because
all Billy had to do was write down where

50
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,410
he got his facts, and give some credit to
that photo, too.

51
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,178
- How could he have written his report
differently?

52
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,762
- Well, if you look at his first sentence,
when it says "The horse has been one of

53
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:45,858
the most popular domesticated animals for
centuries, " he just could've changed the

54
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,442
words a little bit. Maybe he could have
explained what domesticated means. I don't

55
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,106
think that's a word that he would use a
lot.

56
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,482
- I see what you mean.

57
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,250
- What could he have done with this
picture though?

58
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,872
- Well, he could use this picture. If he
took the picture himself, he wouldn't have

59
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:02,490
to do anything, but if he did take it from
this website, which it looks like he did,

60
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,810
he'd just need to copy the web address
down at the top, and that would be it.

61
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,080
That way, he could give the photographer
credit for that person's work.

62
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:16,510
- So, what you're saying is, it's okay to
use facts from other sources, just put

63
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,950
them in your own words.
- Correct.

64
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,964
- And, be sure to include, in your report,
who wrote these facts.

65
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:26,700
- Exactly, and as far as the photos go,
you can use a photo as long as you include

66
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,720
the web address that's on your screen, and
I think in library and psychology class

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,070
you and I will work on that with students
so everyone will know how they can

68
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,120
properly give credit to their sources.

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,690
- We definitely will. That sounds good.
Now we just need to talk to Billy about

70
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,980
this.
- Sounds like a plan.

71
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,410
- Where is that Billy?

72
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,090
- [Instructor] Okay, you have your work
sheets. Let's start filling them out right

73
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:54,518
now. Make sure your name's on your paper,
and we won't take too long, we've got some

74
00:04:54,518 --> 00:05:01,430
extra time [inaudible] as well. So, when you start
writing, if you have a question, raise your hand.

75
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:06,870
You're going to do the predicted cause and
the predicted effects.

76
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:20,342
Now, while you're filling these out, I'm

77
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:29,974
also going to ask a question. I want
to do a quick question. What do you think

78
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:33,654
happened to Billy? Can somebody raise
their hand and tell me? What do you think

79
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:34,998
might happen to Billy?

80
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:41,239
- [male student] He got in trouble with
the teacher.

81
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,280
- [Instructor] He probably got in trouble
with the teacher. Anybody else?

82
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,410
- [female student] Detention.

83
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,900
- [Instructor] And possibly detention,
yes.

84
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,710
- [male student] Suspension.

85
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,040
- [Instructor] Say it one more time.

86
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,220
- [male student] A suspension.

87
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:57,620
- [Instructor] Very good. Okay. Now, let's
do a quick think pair share. Okay, what is the

88
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:05,190
message of this video? So, talk to you
neighbor. Let's think in a pair. Talk to

89
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,580
your neighbor. The person sitting right
next to you. Cassie, you work with Brandy.

90
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:19,061
Brandy, you work with Santiago. Talk to your neighbor
real quick. Your question is, what is the message of this video?

91
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:32,013
[Background Chatter]

92
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,720
Okay, we're going to stop right now. Raise
your hand if you can share, if you can

93
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,880
share out right now. Yes.

94
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:44,130
- [male student] He could use
facts and research [inaudible].

95
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,220
- [Instructor] Very good. So, if he used
facts and research information in his own

96
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,770
words this wouldn't have happened. Yes.

97
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,020
- [female student] He has to give credit
to the original site, or the place he got

98
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,940
it.

99
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,980
- [Instructor] Very good. Thank you,
Cassie, that was great. Okay. So, now

100
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,570
we've done our video, and I just wanted to
say that, as a sixth grader, I made a big

101
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,640
mistake. Before they had the internet, I
used an encyclopedia set and I copied

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,190
stuff into my report, and I thought
"Here's the information, " I didn't realize

103
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,480
I was actually plagiarizing it because I
didn't put it in my own words. So, now

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,850
what we're going to do is, we're going to
move over to our renaissance responders.

105
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:29,770
So, right now, you're all logged in, and I
am going to go over to that right now, and

106
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:36,120
we have a survey. So, it's all
re-programmed, and we're ready to go, and

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,580
what we're going to do is, we're going to
flip our paper to the back side, and

108
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,150
you've got your questions right here.
We're doing an anonymous survey to find

109
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:58,680
out how you feel about plagiarism. So, I
don't want you to feel that it's going to

110
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,745
be something that I'm going to know your
response to, because it really is going to

111
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:10,060
be anonymous, and I want you to circle the
answer that is the most popular response

112
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,020
to the group. So, when you look up here,
you're going to see a graph, and you're

113
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:21,240
going to circle the answer that is the
most popular and you're going to star the

114
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:32,240
answer that is the second most popular.
Okay. What is the level of plagiarism at

115
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,950
our school? You have three choices,
"students do not plagiarize very often,"

116
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:45,270
that's letter A; B, "about half of the
students plagiarize;" C, "almost everyone

117
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:53,690
plagiarizes." Go ahead and
respond. Now, we're going to look at the

118
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,470
graph, and we're waiting for everybody to
respond right now, and I'm looking and I

119
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:03,210
can see some people have responded and
some people have not responded. On your

120
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,910
paper, you will be circling the most
popular response, and you're starring the

121
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,190
second most popular response. Can somebody
tell me what the most popular response is

122
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,300
right now?
- [together] A.

123
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,150
- [Instructor] A. Okay, and that was,
"students don't plagiarize very often."

124
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:27,540
That's good to know. So, go ahead and mark
on your paper right now. A has a circle

125
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,990
around it for number one, and our second
most popular response actually is C and E,

126
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:48,090
so both of those will get starred. I'm so
sorry, did I say E? I meant C. I think

127
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,766
that what happened is, somebody made a
response in a column that they shouldn't

128
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:58,460
have made a response in that column. So,
they answered the wrong question. So, you

129
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:05,000
did it the proper way. We're going to move
on to our question number two.
