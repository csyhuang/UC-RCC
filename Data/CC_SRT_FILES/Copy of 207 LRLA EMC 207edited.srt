00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:01,211
- Welcome to Mrs. Dunford's

2
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:03,010
first grade classroom.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,901
Here you see a Word-Work center,

4
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:07,152
where students are working to build words.

5
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,845
All around the room,

6
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:10,574
student work is proudly displayed

7
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:13,271
along with anchor charts
to anchor student learning.

8
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:15,159
At Computer Center,
students are working on

9
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,236
differentiated computer
programs based on needs.

10
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:19,884
At Listening Center,

11
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:22,740
students listen to stories
to build their fluency.

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,178
Above them is our Word Wall,

13
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:26,780
which displays our sight words.

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,056
Our Center Chart.

15
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:29,682
The students are working
on the Smart Board

16
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:31,796
to integrate technology into reading.

17
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:34,604
Here we have students at Read To Someone,

18
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:37,160
where they are enjoying
reading books to each other.

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,201
Around the back of our
room, books are separated

20
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:43,545
into book bins for genres and
they have their book boxes.

21
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,876
At Read To Self area,
students read independently

22
00:00:46,876 --> 00:00:48,780
and enjoy reading in our tent.

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,984
In the back, we have our
marble jar for compliments

24
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:53,423
and our How Was Your Day board,

25
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,259
along with our Helper Chart.

26
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,534
And last we have My
Table, where I work with

27
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,539
small groups based on needs.

28
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,544
Thank you for joining our classroom.

29
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:02,696
- Okay boys and girls,

30
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:06,155
we just read the biography
by Maurice Sendak.

31
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:09,984
Can you tell me what is a biography?

32
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,491
Let's see... Cassandra.

33
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,814
- A real story.

34
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:15,582
- A real story, you're
right. Kiss your brain.

35
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:18,718
What is it a real story about?

36
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:19,641
Christopher?

37
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:23,460
- It was a real story
about Maurice Sendak.

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,283
- It's a real story about Maurice Sendak.

39
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:27,396
A real story about a real what?

40
00:01:27,396 --> 00:01:29,382
- [Christopher] A real author.

41
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:30,783
- A real author.

42
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:33,112
Could it be about something
other than an author?

43
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:33,598
- [Christopher] Yes.

44
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:35,315
- Yes, as long as it's
about a person, right?

45
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:38,182
A biography tells us about a person.

46
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,295
We're going to fill in
this graphic organizer

47
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:42,419
about Maurice Sendak.

48
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,393
It has different sections in it.

49
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,634
The first section says "Childhood."

50
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:47,795
Can you read that with me?

51
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:49,304
- [Everyone] Childhood.

52
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,754
- The middle section says "Life."

53
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:52,880

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,676
- [Everyone] Life.

55
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:56,811

"Books." What does it say?

56
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:58,075
- [Everyone] Books.

57
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,933

58
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,356
to tell about his childhood,
what happened in his life,

59
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:06,656
and some books that he wrote.

60
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,455
Can you help me fill those things in?

61
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,946
If you're ready to help me,
can I see your hands up?

62
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,332
Good. Put your hands in your lap.

63
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,808
We're going to read this one first,

64
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:16,049
"Worked at a toy store."

65
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,164
Can you read it with me?

66
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:19,706
- [Everyone] Worked at a toy store.

67
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,147
- Hmm, where would that go?

68
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:24,317
"Childhood," "Life," or "Books?"

69
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:25,654
Andrea, what do you think?

70
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:26,815
- [Andrea] Life.

71
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:28,753
- Life. Why do you think that?

72
00:02:28,753 --> 00:02:31,915
- [Andrea] Because...

73
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:35,026
Because...

74
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:36,435
- [Mrs. Dunford] What did he do?

75
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:40,303
- [Andrea] He wrote stories about...

76
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:43,788
- [Mrs. Dunford] He wrote stories,

77
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:46,735
but he "worked at a toy store"

78
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:48,652
and that happened during his what?

79
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:49,395
- [Andrea] Life.

80
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:51,868
- It happened during
his life, you're right.

81
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:56,895
Go ahead and move this
to where it says "Life."

82
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:57,928
Good job.

83
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,587
We're going to give her a
McDonald's cheer, ready?

84
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:02,583
- [All Children] ♫ Ba da
da da da, I'm loving it ♫

85
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,742
- Good job. Let's read this one.

86
00:03:04,742 --> 00:03:07,900
"Where The Wild Things
Are." Can you read with me?

87
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,038
- [Everyone] "Where The Wild Things Are."

88
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,697
- Hmm, where does that one go?

89
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:14,821
Grace?

90
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:15,694
- [Grace] Books.

91
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:17,760
- [Mrs. Dunford] Why do you
think that it goes in Books?

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,956
- [Grace] He wrote it.

93
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,755
- [Mrs. Dunford] He
wrote it, you're right.

94
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:22,682
Can you move it where it goes?

95
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:36,930
(footsteps)

96
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,331
We'll move it just a little
bit closer. There you go.

97
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,351
Good job. We are going to give
her the Truck Driver, ready?

98
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,154
- [Everyone] (car honking)
Good job there buddy.

99
00:03:45,154 --> 00:03:48,266
- Oh, but this one down
here, "Born in Brooklyn."

100
00:03:48,266 --> 00:03:49,275
Can you read it with me?

101
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:52,050
- [Everyone] "Born in Brooklyn."

102
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,326
- Where would that one go? Stephanie?

103
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:55,330
- [Stephanie] Life.

104
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,909
- [Mrs. Dunford] It could go in his life.

105
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,942
Why do you think that it goes in his life?

106
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:02,424
- [Stephanie] Because
he was born in Brooklyn.

107
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:03,585
- [Mrs. Dunford] Because
he was born in Brooklyn,

108
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,744
that's a fact about his
life. Where else could it go?

109
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:07,451
When you're born you're a what?

110
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,508
- [Stephanie] Baby.

111
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:10,991
- [Mrs. Dunford] You're a baby.
So where else could that go?

112
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:11,850
- [Stephanie] Childhood.

113
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:24,266
- [Mrs. Dunford] It could go
in Childhood, you're right.

114
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,745
Good job. We're going to
give her a Fantastic, ready?

115
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:32,365
- [Everyone] You're
(spraying water) fantastic.

116
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,265
- [Mrs. Dunford] Good.
Let's look at this one.

117
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:37,248
"Won Caldecott Medal."
Can you read it with me?

118
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:40,025
- [Everyone] "Won Caldecott Medal."

119
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:42,427
- Hmm, when did that happen?

120
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:42,981
Houston?

121
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,408
- [Houston] In his life.

122
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,407
- [Mrs. Dunford] In his
life. Why do you think

123
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,027
that it happened in his life?

124
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,489
- [Houston] Because he wrote a book

125
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,253
and he got it for his book.

126
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:56,068
- [Mrs. Dunford] You're
right. Exactly right.

127
00:04:56,068 --> 00:05:00,427
He wrote a book and he
won it about a book.

128
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:02,527
- [Houston] Would you put in "Life?"

129
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,438
- You're right, it went in "Life."

130
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:08,367
Perfect. Good job. Let's
give him the Piano, ready?

131
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:10,823
- [Everyone] ♫ Dun dun dun dun ♫

132
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:14,463
♫ You did a good job ♫

133
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:17,348
- So "Kenny's Window."
Can you read it with me?

134
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:19,578
- [Everyone] "Kenny's Window."

135
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:22,811
- Where would "Kenny's Window" go? Dylan?

136
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,088
- [Dylan] Life.

137
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:26,282
- Is "Kenny's WIndow" something
that happened in his life?

138
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,384
You can change your answer.

139
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:31,520
- [Dylan] Um...

140
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,072
- [Mrs. Dunford] Where do you
think "Kenny's Window" would go?

141
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:34,955
- [Dylan] Books!

142
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:37,056
- [Mrs. Dunford] You're
exactly right Dylan.

143
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:40,399
Why would it go in Books?

144
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,129
- I don't know.

145
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:44,150
- Okay, let's talk about
it. "Kenny's Window."

146
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,949
Was that a book that he wrote?

147
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:46,890
- Yes.

148
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,558
- Yes, So would that go
in Books for that reason?

149
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,349
- Yes.

150
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,354
- Yes. So can you move
"Kenny's Window" to Books?

151
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:56,920
- Yep.

152
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,856
- You've got to touch
it a little bit harder.

153
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,296
- I got it.

154
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:06,359
- Okay, good job. Right
there, Dylan, is good.

155
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:09,291
Thank you, Dylan. It's good there.

156
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,455
I'll move it up a little bit further.

157
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,824
There now it's out of the way.

158
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:13,951
- Can I do this?

159
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:15,449
- Okay, you want to do the disco ball?

160
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,594
- [Everyone] ♫ That's
the way, uh huh uh huh ♫

161
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,159
♫ I like it, uh huh uh huh ♫

162
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,099
♫ That's the way, uh huh uh huh ♫

163
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,463
♫ I like it, uh huh uh huh ♫

164
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,215
- [Mrs. Dunford] Good.
Let's look at the last one.

165
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:30,257
"Liked bedtime stories."
Can you read it with me?

166
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,880
- [Everyone] "Liked bedtime stories."

167
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,233
- Where would that one go?

168
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,638
Let's see...

169
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:37,416
Cassandra?

170
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,356
- [Cassandra] Childhood.

171
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,154
- Childhood? Why do you think
that it would go in Childhood?

172
00:06:40,154 --> 00:06:43,451
- [Cassandra] Because
his grandpa and grandma

173
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:45,819
read him some stories.

174
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:55,387
- [Mrs. Dunford] Because they
read him stories, didn't they?

175
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,986
Good job. That completes
our graphic organizer

176
00:06:57,986 --> 00:06:59,240
on Maurice Sendak.

177
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,247
Now, I have your own
biographies for you to read.

178
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,850
Everyone should know where they go.

179
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,322
And your own shoe biography
for you to fill out

180
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:08,006
because remember we're going to do a

181
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,966
display in our hallway
that's called Famous Footwear

182
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:13,799
and have our shoes displayed
for everyone else to see.

183
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:17,448
Alright, right now I want you to stand up.

184
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:19,488
I want you to glue cotton on your shoes.

185
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,288
(stomping)

186
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,273
Stick some marshmallows in your mouth,

187
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:27,865
and go to your area to
read your biography.

188
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:32,490
(footsteps)

189
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:42,709
(inaudible)

190
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,888
- [Mrs. Dunford] Alright, I
want you to sit a little more

191
00:07:46,888 --> 00:07:51,532
in a circle and then I
want you to read two pages

192
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:53,354
and then I want you to fill it out, okay?

193
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:57,708
(background chatter)

194
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,495
Can you read the title? Can
we read the title together?

195
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:01,690
Ready?

196
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,590
- [Everyone] "Joseph Burcheck"

197
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,141
- Good. Who's Joseph Burcheck?

198
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:06,465
- Him.

199
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:10,105
- Yep, that's right.

200
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:13,448
Open up to page two, Dalton.

201
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,314
There you go.

202
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:16,497
Stephanie, can you start for us?

203
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,175
- "Joseph Burcheck"

204
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:23,014
grandma and grandpa [inaudible].

205
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:25,579
There were lots of beautiful

206
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,361
plants and hills where they live."

207
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:33,863
- "Grandma had many books

208
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:37,683
she liked to read

209
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:42,303
and so did Joseph."

210
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,115
- [Mrs. Dunford] Good. Stop there and look

211
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:46,239
at your graphic organizer.
Look at your shoe.

212
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,352
Is there a part of that
shoe that you can fill out?

213
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,080
- Yes.

214
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,520
- Which part do you
think? You think Family?

215
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,538
And you think Childhood,
Dalton. Let's start with Family.

216
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:57,454
What part do you think would go in Family?

217
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,312
- Grandma and grandpa.

218
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,901
- Grandma and grandpa.

219
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,736
That he did what with Grandma and Grandpa?

220
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:04,849
- Read books.

221
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:07,452
- He read books with them.
What else did he do with them?

222
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:10,805
Can you re-read this part?

223
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:15,472
- "There were a lot of
beautiful plants and hills

224
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,666
where they lived."

225
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,055
- "They lived." What do
you think that means?

226
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,269
That he what with his Grandma and Grandpa?

227
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:24,604
- Lived.

228
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:26,287
- He lived with them, that's right.

229
00:09:26,287 --> 00:09:28,389
So can you write that in Family?

230
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:32,835
Put that in Ideas. And
then let Dalton tell you

231
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:35,703
what he thinks goes in Childhood, okay?

232
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:37,345
- Got it.

233
00:09:37,345 --> 00:09:40,865
(background chatter)

234
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,641
- [Mrs. Dalton] What
do you guys filling in?

235
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:49,883
(background chatter)

236
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:53,203
- How do you spell "lived?"

237
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:55,773
- [Other Child] L...

238
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:57,181
- No, lived.

239
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,795
- [Dalton] L-I...

240
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:07,472
V-E-D.

241
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:08,372
[Mrs. Dalton] Who does his live with?

242
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:10,207
- He cheated.

243
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:11,508
- [Other Child] Grandma and Grandpa.

244
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:12,634
- His Grandma and Grandpa? Is that what

245
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,456
you were going to add to
the graphic organizer?

246
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:15,988
You're exactly right.
You're doing a good job.

247
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,194
Jenn, I think she needs the marker.

248
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,585
There you go. Keep it up.

249
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:25,952
Keep up the good work.

250
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:32,868
- [Girl] H-E R-A-N [inaudible]

251
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:47,802
(background chatter)

252
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:51,238
- [Blonde Woman] "Her family
was quick to hang up her work."

253
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,179
Your turn.

254
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,706
- [Group] "Her family was
quick to hang up her work."

255
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,946
- [Blonde Woman] Nice job.
And we have a Family section

256
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:02,164
on here, so what do you think Dylan?

257
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,218
What did her family do?

258
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:06,284
- [Dylan] Put her pictures up.

259
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:09,419
- That's exactly right,
they "hung up her work."

260
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,601
Good job Dylan.

261
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:19,915
I'm going to show you where. Right here.

262
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:27,181
T-H-E

263
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:31,484
- Do you know why they're
putting that in Family?

264
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:34,246
Can you tell me? Because
her family did what?

265
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:36,719
What did her family like to do?

266
00:11:36,719 --> 00:11:39,203
- Put pictures up.

267
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:40,608
- Hang up her pictures, that's exactly why

268
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,443
they're adding it to Family.

269
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:45,437
- [Blonde Woman] Go ahead and
finish what you need to write.

270
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,907
- [Mrs. Dunford] You've
got to finish it, Dylan.

271
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,542
You're doing a great job.

272
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,279
- [Blonde Woman] There you go, her work.

273
00:11:54,382 --> 00:12:00,845
(background chatter)

274
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,503
- Why is this a biography?

275
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:09,745
- [Little Boy] Because it tells by a...

276
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:13,499
girl and she's writing books.

277
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,438
And she was reading books and writing.

278
00:12:17,438 --> 00:12:19,713
- You're right, it's a biography.

279
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:22,151
A biography is a story about a real person

280
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,167
and that's exactly what she was.

281
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,538
Can you read me one of these?

282
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,607
- "When Amy was little,

283
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:32,546
she liked to read."

284
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:33,324
- [Mrs. Dunford] Good.

285
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:34,949
And why does that belong in Childhood?

286
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:37,144
- Because she was doing it as a child.

287
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:39,070
- [Mrs. Dunford] She was
doing it when she was little.

288
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,591
You're right. You're exactly right.

289
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,427
Now, who's going to fill in the ideas?

290
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:46,027
Who knows where did
she get her ideas from?

291
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:48,625
Do you know where she got her ideas from?

292
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,367
- [Little Girl] From the books.

293
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,631
- From the books. Well, actually,

294
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:55,576
where did she get the ideas for the books?

295
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,599
Can you read this part for me?

296
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:02,510
- "Amy liked [Inaudible]
about a lot of books.

297
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:08,454
Things people say help Amy."

298
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,171
- What helps Amy?

299
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:15,373
- "Things people say."

300
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,194
- Things people say. So where
does she get her ideas from?

301
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,634
- People.

302
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,851
- People and the things
that they tell her, right?

303
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,848
Things that they say.

304
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:26,182
Can you write that in the Ideas part?

305
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:26,548
- Yes.

306
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:28,672
- Good job. The things that people say

307
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:31,524
are what help her and give her ideas.

308
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:35,482
Houston, can you help her direct that?

309
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,115
That would be great.

310
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,412
You guys are doing a fantastic job.

311
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:49,667
(background chatter)

312
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,430
- [Houston] Oh, you wrote the wrong stuff.

313
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,751
You're writing on the wrong side.

314
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,247
You're writing on the wrong side.

315
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:16,078
(background chatter)

316
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:17,691
- She's writing that whole section. Why?

317
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,675
Can someone tell me why she's
writing that in Childhood?

318
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:24,413
Clint, do you know? Why is
she writing that in Childhood?

319
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,213
Why is she writing that
Joseph did things with his

320
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:29,115
Grandpa in Childhood?

321
00:14:29,115 --> 00:14:33,724
- [Clint] Because he used
to watch him play guitar

322
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:36,743
and go in the woods
with him and talk nice--

323
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,783
- Did he do that when he was an adult

324
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,286
or when he was a child?

325
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,289
- Child.

326
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,482
- Right, so is that why
it would go in Childhood?

327
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,202
- Yes.

328
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:48,663
- Jeffrey, can you tell me
what is this story about?

329
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:52,449
- [Jeffrey] It tells real stuff.

330
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:54,689
- [Mrs. Dunford] It tells
real stuff about what?

331
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,045
- Joseph Burcheck.

332
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,961
- Joseph Burcheck, yep.
That's what it does.

333
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:02,165
It tells real things about
him. You guys are doing great.

334
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:03,965
Keep up the good work.
