1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,734
- [Instructor] Do not put any button caps

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:03,734
in the center of the ridge.

3
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:05,011
Put them right on the
bottom edge on each side of

4
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:05,882
that felt.

5
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,145
(hammers banging)

6
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:12,076
- [Man] Do I get a lot now?

7
00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:12,761
- [Instructor] You get what?

8
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,694
You can't do anything down here.

9
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:18,483
You need to help him roll that out.

10
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,325
He's going to need help right there.

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,033
You can put one in one
side and then pull it down

12
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,304
through there.

13
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:31,390
One right there.

14
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:38,389
When in doubt, put a button.

15
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:40,706
If you're wondering if
it should be in there,

16
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:41,971
it should be.

17
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:44,821
We're a little far apart, right here.

18
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:46,750
You definitely need to
put one, right here.

19
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:47,769
- [Man] So it's under.

20
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:49,826
- [Instructor] Reach down
right here and put one in.

21
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:51,893
- [Student] This back end going to um...

22
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:55,247
Wrinkle?

23
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,372
Before you put a nail there.

24
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:57,707
- [Student] Can I nail
the top part of this?

25
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:58,964
- [Instructor] Yes, absolutely.

26
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,211
- [Student] Because if I--

27
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,374
- [Instructor] Your feet need
to be on a button, regardless

28
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:06,213
on which side you're on,
you need to be on the button.

29
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,677
- [Student] Please, nail
that one right behind you.

30
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,375
- [Instructor] This sun,
coming out like this,

31
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,622
makes this felt?

32
00:01:14,622 --> 00:01:15,084
- [Student] Hot.

33
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:18,329
- Hot and soft, and it'll tear easily.

34
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:21,916
Now this is 30 pound felt,
it's not 15 pound felt.

35
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:26,112
So it's a lot thicker than what,
you got two common kinds

36
00:01:26,112 --> 00:01:27,284
you're going to be putting on.

37
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:28,685
15 and 30.

38
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,648
Okay.

39
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:37,180
Okay how are we doing over here?

40
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,534
- [Student] If you lay it up
there, the top won't fly down.

41
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:00,330
- [Instructor] That's right.

42
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,085
That's good.

43
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,217
Communicate.

44
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,421
Communicate with each other, right there.

45
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:08,929
(hammers banging)

46
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,433
Did that work out, work for you?

47
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,413
- [Student] Yeah.

48
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:14,985
- [Man] Stand this way.

49
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:19,332
- How many rinds do we need?

50
00:02:19,332 --> 00:02:20,900
- [Instructor] You got your left rind.

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,062
Now, we need our interval
going up to the roof.

52
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,730
Tell us what it is.

53
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,882
What you need to do on a three tab.

54
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,774
How far, what is our interval here?

55
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,767
Remember?

56
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,001
Can you remember?

57
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,115
What is it?

58
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:44,978
Speak up.

59
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:45,616
- [Student] Five.

60
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:46,178
- [Student 2] Five.

61
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:47,540
- [Instructor] Five inches, okay?

62
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:48,625
Don't be scared.

63
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,144
You know it.

64
00:02:49,144 --> 00:02:49,606
You shout it right out.

65
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,495
Five inches.

66
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:53,086
Five inches up.

67
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,467
Every five inches.

68
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:57,689
Be sure to measure from
the top of the seam.

69
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,860
Don't measure from here.

70
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,460
It's got to be from right here.

71
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,758
Measure up five, 10, 15, 20.

72
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:05,110
Just go ahead and mark it up you're roof.

73
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,450
Get your layout there
and your layout there.

74
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,861
Double check each other.

75
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,323
Check behind each other.

76
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,028
If the layout's not right,
and we have to tear shingles

77
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,612
back off, are those shingles any good?

78
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,464
- [Student] No.

79
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:18,318
- What?

80
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:18,985
- [Student] No, sir.

81
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,251
- They're not any good.

82
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,857
Let's make sure we double
check behind each other

83
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,168
and get the layout correct.

84
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:32,143
Remember.

85
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:35,006
Team work, just like on the job.

86
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,008
(hammers banging)

87
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,995
Anybody can make a mistake.

88
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,106
You have a couple of eyes on it.

89
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,351
Checking behind, that's a lot better.

90
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:52,033
(hammers banging)

91
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:00,061
You can mark on this side.

92
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,168
It's not going to hurt a thing.

93
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:02,620
You can put a bigger

94
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,171
mark on there, so you can see it.

95
00:04:04,171 --> 00:04:05,001
- [Student] Alright.

96
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,012
(hammers banging)

97
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:22,383
- Something like that.

98
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:23,056
- [Student] Okay.

99
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:23,839
- [Instructor] You can see that.

100
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,522
That's not small and tiny.

101
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:27,211
That's big.

102
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:29,375
Look at the difference
right here, Enrique.

103
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,591
My marks, and your marks right here.

104
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:38,814
You can, especially, I mean,
this is relatively new felt.

105
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,906
This felt gets marked up and scratched up.

106
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,755
If you put a large crow
foot mark, on here,

107
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:46,485
you're going to know exactly
where to hold that thing.

108
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,834
Make sure that you get
it where you can see it.

109
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,971
We're going to cover this stuff right back up...
