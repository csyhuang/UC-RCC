1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:10,210
- Our is, like, Crown-- Crown Royal, and, like,
it shows, like, a helmet, and, like, an ad

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,950
for it, and it says, "He who wears the
crown, " I think that's, like, if you wear

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,340
the helmet, you will seem cool.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,610
- Mm-hmm, and the helmet is for what, do
you think? Motorcycles or cars, kind of

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:31,530
racing kind of stuff? And Crown Royal,
tobacco or alcohol? Alcohol, and racing a

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,350
car. Thoughts?

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,630
- Drinking and driving. Huh.

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,990
- Well, that's bad.

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:45,150
- But they appeal to your-- your, uh, love
of racecars and motorcycles and cool

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,726
stuff, but those two don't really mix, do
they? Next group.

11
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:56,650
- Ours is tobacco, and it has a picture of
a firefighter, and it says, A bit braver,

12
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:04,150
so it's trying to hook you by you
wanting to be braver, and trying tobacco.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:11,790
- So the inference there would be that
tobacco makes you braver? What do you

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,520
think? Could it really work? If I chew
tobacco? Am I gonna be able to fight a

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,000
fire?
- No.

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:25,830
- But firefighting appeals to a lot of
young children, right? That bravery, that

17
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:31,530
toughness, that rugged fireman thing. It's
like, if I do chewing tobacco, I'm a

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,570
rugged fireman type. Um, what are my teeth
gonna look like, though?

19
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,760
- [together] Yellow.

20
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,980
- Not gonna look like the rugged fireman
type, am I?

[Background Chatter]

22
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:57,726
- Fireman sounds like he smiles, is that
what you said? All right, um, ladies?

23
00:01:57,726 --> 00:02:06,967
- Um, ours was alcohol, and, um, they got
our attention by, like, the grandma and

24
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:11,542
the daughter playing patty-cake and
telling stories about her.

25
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:14,960
- So grandma and daughter-- and
granddaughter playing patty-cake, lovely

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,090
little sunny porch, sponsored by... ?

27
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,140
- Budweiser.
- Oh, my.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,770
- Oh, that's so popular.

29
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:30,100
- So drink? You're appealing to the family
nature? And the message is, drink our

30
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,766
drink.

31
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:37,120
- Yeah, it says that, like, all stories
weren't about family, they also had some

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,910
other stuff.
- Family and Budweiser.

33
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,390
- Yeah.
- No.

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,750
- Yeah, you're getting it now. All right.
Ladies?

35
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,520
- Um, ours is, um--

36
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,590
- There's isn't really an ad. There's is a
display at a grocery store.

37
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,170
- Yeah, like, there is, um, a whole bunch
of, like, alcohol in the background, and

38
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:04,970
up closer, there's tobacco, and then
there's a bunch a candy bars that should

39
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,970
appeal to the little kids.
- Right next to the... ?

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,510
- The tobacco.
- Tobacco, okay. Candy bars.

41
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,030
- Like right there, and then, um, also you
have pretty much the candy.

42
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,505
- Alcohol behind the booth, tobacco right
up front, and candy bars right at hand

43
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:24,295
level.

44
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,453
- Kids would probably think that tobacco's
candy.

45
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:29,705
- They might.
- Or as good as candy.

46
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,306
- Does tobacco come in flavors like candy
does?

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,438
- [together] Yeah.
- No.

48
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:36,017
- Yes, it does.
- Oh.

49
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,989
- Mint, berry, apple.
- Ew, really?

50
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:46,150
- Really. Hey, I think I missed a group.
Did I miss a group? This one up front?

51
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,890
Nope. Did I get you guys already? Did you
guys share? Oh, you did share, just with

52
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,580
me. Share with the rest of the group. It's

53
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:03,641
- Ours is alcohol and, like, if you're a
rockstar, you'll drink, like, if you drink

54
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,824
this, then you will become a rockstar.

55

- The girls in bikinis.

- So how many guys are in that picture?
- One.

58
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,200
- One guy, and he's the one who's drinking
the alcohol, and... ?

- Fifteen girls.

- Fifteen girls in bikinis. So if-- the
message is, if you drink this... ?

Oh, sorry. Eyes. Ears. Mouth. Thanks.

You've had a chance to look at these ads.
Um, you've got a chance to see how they're

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,010
trying to hook you in. You're knowing that
the messages that they're sending are

67
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:58,610
slightly warped. It's their trick to pull
you in, but it's your job to think and

68
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,840
process through using your critical
thinking skills. Weigh it out. Consider,

69
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,440
but then choose something else that's
healthier. So we've looked at negative

70
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,780
influences. It's time to talk about
positive influences in your life, things

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,490
that can help you say no to all of that,
no matter how appealing it is, no matter

72
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,810
how many girls in bikinis show up. Leave
your cards right where they are in the

73
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:31,120
center. It's time to take a look at the
charts that are around the room. There are

74
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:43,490
five of them. These are activities you can
do instead of things like using drugs,

75
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:49,310
alcohol, tobacco, like a social activity,
um, something you can do with someone

76
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,830
else. Ideas?
- Have a sleepover.

77
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:02,370
- Sleepover, good. All right, so in just a
few minutes, we're gonna be rotating

78
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,180
around the charts with different
groupings. We're gonna be writing down our

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:17,630
ideas of other positive things instead of
this. Can anyone name one physical

80
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,200
activity, something you can do that would
be instead of using drugs, a positive

81
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,670
thing? Football? Yeah. Did you want to
share too? Go ahead.

82
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,360
- Um, riding your bike around the block.

83
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,200
- Good. You're on the right track, guys.
Keep those ideas in your head. When you

84
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,640
get to the chart, you'll have to write it
down. What's something you can do with

85
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,870
your brain, a mental activity that would
be positive?

86
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,400
- Chess.
- Chess.

87
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,600
- I like chess.

88
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:53,209
- Math. Not for everybody, I understand.
Um, this chart over here says "Emotional."

89
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:59,150
What's something you can do, um, that
can make your emotions feel better, your

90
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,240
passions, or whatever? How can you support
yourself emotionally, so you can say no to

91
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,395
this?

92
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,710
- Trying to think happy.

93
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,970
- Yep. Positive thoughts.

94
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,630
- Watching emotional movies.

95
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,600
- Definitely gets your mind off those. I
know you got great ideas, and I'm gonna be

96
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,600
willing to see those on those papers in
just a few minutes, so save them in your head.

97
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,220
- Okay.

98
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:31,900
- The last one is spiritual. Spiritual.
Somehow you can nurture your spirit, so

99
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,670
you have the ability to say no to negative
influences.

100
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,900
- Go to church.

101
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:43,560
- Church. All right. Save it. You'll get a
chance. Time to look at your pencils

102
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,980
again. Leave your papers right where they
are, okay? Face-up. This time, we're gonna

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,230
go by color, and you might notice that
there are markers at each station, for the

104
00:07:50,410 --> 00:08:05,000
right color. So when you get to the
station, if you are-- patience. I promise

105
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:13,110
I'll explain it. No worries. When you get
to your station, we're gonna start with

106
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,890
your bag of colors. You will take your bag of
colors and your marker, and you will only

107
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,570
use your color marker. So if you are a
green guy, you would grab a green marker

108
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,160
and you will be writing at this station
first. You'll write down however many

109
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,050
ideas you want. You'll talk it out with
your group. You might notice, Mitchell,

110
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,700
that I also put group work, uh, reminders
up here, about how to work with others in

111
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,000
your group. One, everybody has the right
to speak, so make sure you give everybody

112
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,130
a chance to talk it out if they need to,
and to write it down, the topic. Don't

113
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,260
interrupt. Give everybody a chance to
share their side. Two, everybody has the

114
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,030
right to be respected. We're not looking
for put downs. We're looking for ones that

115
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,850
can encourage us, positive things, so when
you're getting ready to write positive

116
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,150
things, speak positively to each other as
well. And three, everyone has to agree to

117
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,840
work together to solve a conflict. So if
you're having a difficulty in your group,

118
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,710
talk it out. Work together to solve that
problem. If it's not working, and you

119
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,150
can't solve the problem, who can you turn
to for help?

120
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:07,980
- You?

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,160
- Me. And others in your group. So if
you're a green person, you're gonna get

122
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,600
one green marker, and there are multiple
in here, in case your marker doesn't work.

123
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,860
Get a different one. Write down whatever
ideas you want. When you hear me say,

124
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,140
"Switch," or, "Rotate," you move to the
next chart around like the face of a

125
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,610
clock. Take your marker with you. So
there'll be multiple colors on here.

126
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,220
You'll get a chance to write on every one.
Yes?

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,240
- How does this work? Are you supposed to
write it down like a list?

128
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,600
- You can write all over that paper. Yeah.
Anywhere, as long as we're on the front.

129
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,890
Everywhere, all over that paper, so you
can all be on there at the same time as

130
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,870
you want, you can take turns, you can
arrange however you and your group want

131
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,340
to. You each can have a marker, though.
There's plenty of them for everyone.

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,810
Yellow's are over here at "Emotional,"
um, I believe blue's are "Social,"

133
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:08,220
purple's are "Physical," and oranges are
"Mental." Questions before we begin?

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,290
Think about something to do besides.
You'll have approximately 30 seconds to a

135
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,788
minute, so listen for me to say, "Switch."
Keep writing until I say it. Go!

on the floor. Does that work better? I

138
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:37,720

Here you go. You guys want to take that

139

one down, too, put it on the floor, so
it's a little easier to write on?

things related to learning, using the

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:17,266
brain. Spelling. You can practice your
spelling. You can do your math. I think

is definitely a social event.

to other people, human beings, a

156
00:12:20,017 --> 00:12:31,697
relationship with them? All right. Ready
in 10, nine, finish what you're writing,

157
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:36,914
eight, seven, six, taking your marker with
you in five...

158
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:37,773
- Oh, our marker?

159
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:46,294
- Four. Yep. Your writing in your color.
Three, two, one, rotate.

161
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:03,470
- Spiritual. All things that are
spiritual. What does that really mean?

162
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,420
- Your spirit?

163
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,090
- Your spirit, yeah. It could be feelings.
I think we did emotions, though, right?

164
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,090
- Yeah.

165
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,930
- So this one would be more nurturing your
soul, yourself.

166
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,260
- We've got meditation.

167
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
- We've got mediation, right.
- Yoga!

168
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,668
- Oh, yeah! Why don't you write that one
down?

169
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,210
- How do you spell "yoga"?

170
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:38,560
- Yes, perfect. The Bible, poems. How much
do you connect with your spirit or your

171
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:49,886
soul? Any other resources or people?
Pastor from a church. Friends you know

172
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:56,272
from the church, or wherever you attend
services. Who else besides a pastor can

173
00:13:56,272 --> 00:14:00,103
lead, um, a group?
- You can pray.

174
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:08,811
- Pray, good. You guys are on the right
track. Emotional support. Where can we

175
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:15,173
find emotional support? Family, friends,
good. Who are some other resources for

176
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:20,072
emotional support? Culture? How can we
nurture your own good feelings? What do

177
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:22,905
you do to feel better?
- Cuddle your pets.

178
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:26,876
- Cuddle your pets. You know that one's my
favorite, too.

179
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:37,092
- It's okay, you don't have to spell
things. All right, capping markers. Ready

180
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:46,706
to move? 10, nine, eight, seven, six,
ready gentlemen in five,

181
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,989
taking your marker in four, three, two,
one. Rotate.
