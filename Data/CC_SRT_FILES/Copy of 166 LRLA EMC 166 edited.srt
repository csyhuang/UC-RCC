- [Students] W!

38
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:30,368
- [Teacher] Good job.

39
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:35,481
We have been talking about spring

40
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,071
and we have been talking about

41
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:39,311
the seasons of summer and winter

42
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:41,809

43
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:44,187

- [Student] Winter.

45

- [Teacher] Winter. Very good.

46
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:47,381
Well this book, "Hedgehog is Hungry,"

47
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:51,931
that's written by Beverley Randell,

48
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:54,008
is about a hedgehog.

49
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:58,216
And he is asleep during the wintertime.

50
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,185
And he wakes up in the springtime

51
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:01,625
and he is hungry.

52
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,947
But first, look at this picture.

53
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,657
Have y'all ever seen
anything like this before?

54
00:02:07,187 --> 00:02:11,266
- [Students] No.
- [Student] I saw a hedgehog in a book, but not real.

55
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,587
- [Teacher] You've seen a hedgehogs
before in a book but not real?

56
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:14,665
- [Student] Not me.

57
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,292
- [Teacher] Hedgehogs are pokey.

58
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:18,508
And when they curl up,

59
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,854
their little spikes poke out.

60
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,492
They pop up. That's right.

61
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,534
Why do you think they pop up?

62
00:02:24,534 --> 00:02:26,356
- [Student] Cuz that means you're scared.

63
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:27,599
- [Teacher] That means they're scared.

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,358
- [Student] Nature protects. 
If a person runs into

65
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,937
the pointy stuff, they'll say, "Ouch."

66
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,014
- [Teacher] That's right. And it protects them.

67
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,209
Well, as we are reading this book today

68
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:39,939
we're going to read this book to find

69
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,212
out what Hedgehog is going to eat.

70
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:44,931
What Hedgehog is hungry for,

71
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,798
and what he is going to eat.

72
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,877
I want you to look at your partner,

73
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,573
and I want you to tell your partner

74
00:02:50,573 --> 00:02:51,930
what you think hedgehog might eat?

75
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,200
(Children discuss)

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,325
- [Student] I am thinking he, is
going to eat a worm.

77
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:03,237
- [Student] I think he is going to eat a snail.

78
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:05,491
- [Teacher] Okay. Alright. Well, I heard

79
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:08,948
I heard worm, and I heard snail.

80
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,387
And she said snail too.

81
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:11,816
Why do you both think the hedgehog

82
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,886
is going to eat a snail?

83
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:15,305
- [Student] Because there's one
right in front of it.

84
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,580
- [Student] I think it's going to eat a worm.

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,950
- [Teacher] You think it's going to eat a worm?

86
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,306
- [Student] I think he's going to eat a leaf.

87
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,790
- [Teacher] You think he might eat leaves. Okay.

88
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,654
Alright. So, we're
going to read this book

89
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:36,224
to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat.

90
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:38,561
Alright, why are we reading this book?

91
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,841
- [Everyone] To find out what Hedgehog

92
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,077
is going to eat.

93
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,377
- [Teacher] But guess what?

94
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,036
There's going to be some words

95
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:49,101
in this book that we might not

96
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:50,935
know how to read.

97
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:52,735
One of the words we are going to

98
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:55,638
work on today is new high-frequency word.

99
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:57,576
And remember, high-frequency words

100
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:00,291
there aren't any rules for them, are they?

101
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,475
We just have to learn the way they look,

102
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,634
so that we can learn to read them.

103
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,071
Can you read, tell me what this word is?

104
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,300
(Students sound out word)
- [Everyone] Here.

105
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,368
- [Teacher] This is the word "here."

106
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:13,438
I love how you decoded it.

107
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,391
- [Student] We already learned about it.

108
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,692
- [Teacher] We have learned about here.

109
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,515
Here is on our...

110
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,055
- [Student] Word wall.
- [Teacher] Word wall,

111
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,330
isn't it? Excellent job!

112
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,793
Well, today it is important that

113
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:25,895
you not only know how to read words,

114
00:04:25,895 --> 00:04:27,277
but it's important that you also

115
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:28,636
know how to spell words.

116
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,318
So, I'm going to give you the letters

117
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:31,792
that you need.

118
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,070
I want you to dump them out,

119
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,613
and I want you to spell "here" for me.

120
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:36,853
I'm going to turn this around

121
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:38,073
so you can't look at it.

122
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,848
And I want you to spell "here" for me.

123
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,658
I hear Lilly saying it's (mumbles).

124
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:48,502
Here.

125
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:49,861
- [Student] I spelled it.

126
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:50,963
- [Teacher] Alright, I'm going
to turn it back around.

127
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:52,021
Are you all ready?

128
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,646
Alright, check it!

129
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:58,069
- [Students] H-E-R-E

130
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,113
- [Students] I did it!

131
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:00,628
- [Teacher] Are you all right?

132
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:01,526
(Students cheer)

133
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:02,827
What word did you just build?

134
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:04,012
- [Students] Here.

135
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,879
- [Teacher] Here. Alright, now we can build it,

136
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,529
so I want you to... write it.

137
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,183
I want you to write the word "here".

138
00:05:16,893 --> 00:05:19,291
Not look at your letters. Okay.

139
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:21,032
Are you ready? Show me how you

140
00:05:21,032 --> 00:05:22,774
write the word "here".

141
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:27,544
And then I'll let you check it again.

142
00:05:40,135 --> 00:05:41,307
You're almost there.

143
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,910
What else do you think comes next?

144
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,092
- [Student] I think you push harder.

145
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:45,092
- [Teacher] You want to try pushing harder?

146
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,626
You think you got it, Natalia?

147
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,448
- [Student] I put an exclamation mark. Here!

148
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:57,779
- [Teacher] You put an exclamation mark at the end.

149
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,289
- [Student] I spelled it.

150
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:01,196
- [Teacher] You did? Alright, I'm
going to turn it around.

151
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:02,746
You all ready to check it?

152
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:04,257
(Students cheer)

153
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:05,359
- [Teacher] Did you get it?

154
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,564
Alright, read your word.

155
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:08,703
- [Everyone] Here.

156
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:09,703
- [Teacher] Here.

157
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,023
Very good.

158
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:11,824
- [Student] H-A-R-E, here.

159
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:12,824
- [Teacher] Here.

160
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:14,241
- [Student] It's not, A.

161
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:20,524
- [Teacher] Alright, now, one way that we can help

162
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:23,660
ourself is by looking at high-frequency

163
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,902
words, and learning all of
our high-frequency words.

164
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:28,421
Our high-frequency words
are on our word wall.

165
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,765
So, that's one place that you can look

166
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:33,529
if you get stuck.

167
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,420
Another thing that we can do

168
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,080
is we can look at the pictures

169
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,005
to help us with the tricky part.

170
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,480
So, we're going to go through,

171
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,699
and that's what we're
going to do right now.

172
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,637
We are going to look at the pictures.

173
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,146
Are you ready?

174
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:50,756
"Hedgehog is hungry". That's our title.

175
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,418
Now, what time of year do you think it is?

176
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,519
- [Students] Winter.

177
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,690
- [Teacher] Winter. It is definitely winter.

178
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,431
- [Student] Because all of the
leaves are off the tree.

179
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,103
- [Teacher] Because all of the
leaves are off the tree.

180
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:01,432
Alright let's look at the pictures.

181
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:05,114
Now, who do you see buried
down in the leaves there?

182
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:06,157
- [Student] I see Hedgehog.

183
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:07,657
- [Teacher] You see Hedgehog.

184
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:09,153
Is Hedgehog awake or is he asleep?

185
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:10,732
- [Students] Asleep.

186
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:12,217
- [Teacher] And you know why he's asleep?

187
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:14,655
- [Student] Because it's winter and he hibernated.

188
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:15,986
- [Teacher] And he's hibernating.

189
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,140
Very good, turn to the next page.

190
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,788
Now what season is it?

191
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:22,168
What season is it?

192
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:23,048
- [Student] It's spring.

193
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:24,484
- [Teacher] It's spring!

194
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:26,077
And is Hedgehog still asleep?

195
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,264
- [Students] No.

196
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,841
- [Teacher] No. Hedgehog is awake.

197
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,443
Let's turn to the next page.

198
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:31,777
And there he goes.

199
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:32,778
Here he comes. He's going out

200
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,297
for a little walk.

201
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:36,085
What do you think he's doing?

202
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,487
- [Student] Find something to eat.

203
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:41,425
- [Teacher] He's going to find something to eat.

204
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:42,829
Let's turn to the next page.

205
00:07:44,609 --> 00:07:45,744
Hedgehog is hungry.

206
00:07:45,744 --> 00:07:47,903
And what is the first thing he finds?

207
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:48,705
He finds a...

208
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,268
- [Students] Snail.

209
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,527
- [Student] I was right!

210
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,442
- [Teacher] Uh, you were right.

211
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:52,984
- [Student] And me.

212
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:54,518
- [Teacher] Okay, let's turn to the next page.

213
00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:56,759
He's still hungry.

214
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,800
- [Student] He ate worms and caterpillar.

215
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,133
- [Teacher] Okay, now that is a very
big word, caterpillar.

216
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:04,514
How did you all know that

217
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:06,059
that was the word "caterpillar?"

218
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:09,238
- [Student] I saw it right there.

219
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,469
- [Teacher] Alright, listen closely.

220
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,676
You all just told me two strategies

221
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,057
you can use to help yourself

222
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:19,589
when you come to a tricky word.

223
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,039
You can get your mouth ready

224
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,979
for the beginning sound.

225
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,452
Or, you can look at the...

226
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:26,696
pictures. Tell me again.

227
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,296
You can get your mouth ready

228
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,792
for the beginning sound.

229
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,835
Or you can look at the...

230
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,146
- [Everyone] pictures.

231
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:37,143
- [Teacher] Okay, let's turn to the next page.

232
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,208
Now, what does he find?

233
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,901
What is that?

234
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,168
Okay, we talked about one of the

235
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,549
strategies is we can get our mouth

236
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,917
ready for the beginning sound.

237
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,536
- (Students comment)

238
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:49,932
- [Teacher] Alright, let's run our finger

239
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:50,768
underneath it now.

240
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,309
Let's look at it. Let me write it.

241
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:56,709
Let's do, "Bug". Let's spell bug and see.

242
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:57,813
How would we spell bug?

243
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,206
Get your arms ready.

244
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:03,497
- [Everyone] (word sounds)

245
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,999
- [Teacher] Is that going to be the word bug?

246
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,519
- [Students] No.

247
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,620
- [Teacher] No. So we're going to
have to look at that.

248
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,558
This is the word "beetle."

249
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,889
Can you say that word?

250
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,247
- [Everyone] Beetle.

251
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:24,164
- [Teacher] And look underneath it.

252
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,500
What do you see underneath it?

253
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,762
That is a slug. Ooooh.

254
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:30,584
Now, just like-- eyes are up here, Lilly.

255
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:35,145
Eyes are up here. Okay there we go.

256
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,269
Just like we can get our mouth

257
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:38,722
ready for the beginning sound,

258
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:40,821
you all also know how to decode words,

259
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,819
Is everybody's eyes up here?

260
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,038
So, we can get our mouth ready

261
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:47,789
for the beginning blend, which is, sl...

262
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,588
What sound is the U going to make?

263
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,923
- [Everyone] Uh.

264
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,002
- [Teacher] Because there's only one vowel.

265
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:53,466
And what sound's the G going to make?

266
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:55,172
- [Everyone] Guh.

267
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,610
- [Teacher] Let's blend it together. 
Are you ready?

268
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,862
- [Everyone] Sl-u-g. Slug.

269
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:02,682
- [Teacher] Now, look at me.

270
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,584
You have three ways now.

271
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,455
You can look at the pictures.

272
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,139
You can get your mouth ready

273
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,275
for the beginning sound.

274
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,923
And you can decode words

275
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:13,553
that have one vowel in them.

276
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,357
Alright, let's close our book up.
All the way up.

277
00:10:18,777 --> 00:10:21,071
When you are reading,

278
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:24,252
I want you to read to find out

279
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:26,529
what Hedgehog eats.

280
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:28,339
What is your purpose for reading?

281
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,168
- [Everyone] To find
out what hedgehog eats.

282
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,515
- [Teacher] Alright, start reading.

283
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:38,695
Hedgehog is hungry.

284
00:10:38,695 --> 00:10:53,277
(Students reading aloud)

285
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:54,829
- [Teacher] What did we say he was?

286
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:55,933
Use the pictures to help you

287
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,227
with the tricky part.

288
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:58,694
We said he was a... asleep.

289
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:00,998
- [Student] Asleep.

290
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:02,640
- [Teacher] Good job.

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,094
- [Student] It wasn't doing that space in there.

292
00:11:06,094 --> 00:11:08,591
- [Teacher] That's right because 
"asleep" is one word.

293
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:14,445
(Student reading aloud)

294
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:28,221
There's our high-frequency word: "here."

295
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:36,793
(children reading aloud)

296
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,423
- [Student] I'm tricked.

297
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:41,986
- [Teacher] You're tricked. Alright,
so what will you do?

298
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:47,367
- [Student and Teacher] H-un-gry
- [Student] Hungry.

299
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,843
- [Teacher] Very good. Hedgehog is hungry.

300
00:11:54,917 --> 00:12:24,991
(Student reading aloud)

301
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:27,159
- [Teacher] Good job.

302
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:32,380
(Students reading aloud)

303
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:43,898
- [Student] Slug.

304
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,403
- [Teacher] Good job.

305
00:12:46,197 --> 00:13:09,127
(Students reading aloud)

306
00:13:09,988 --> 00:13:12,102
- [Teacher] It does spell the word "spring."

307
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,363
Good job. Alright.

308
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:17,345
I love the way you all did two things:

309
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,315
I love the way you can
all use your fingers

310
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,997
to help you point.

311
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:26,260
I saw Lilly stretching lots of words out.

312
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,103
When she came to a word
that she didn't know,

313
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,961
she got her mouth ready and she stretched

314
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:35,815
those out just like we
did with the word "slug".

315
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,833
I saw Poniyota using the pictures

316
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,063
help her with the tricky part.

317
00:13:40,063 --> 00:13:42,035
We are reading to find out what

318
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,857
hedgehog ate.

319
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,017
Do you remember what hedgehog ate?

320
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,188
- [Student] Snails.

321
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:48,920
- [Teacher] He ate snails. What was
something else he ate?

322
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,938
- [Student] A snail.

323
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:55,003
- [Teacher] A snail. What was 
something else he ate?

324
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:56,594
- [Student] A bug.

325
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,660
- [Teacher] A bug. What was something else he ate?

326
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,262
- [Student] He ate a beetle bug.

327
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,342
