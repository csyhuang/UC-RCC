1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,360
- [Insructor] Gina.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,650
- I wanted to test the amount of acid in
different brands of antacids, example

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,710
Alka-Seltzer, Maalox and Tums, can
effectively neutralize.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:21,300
- Okay, so far we've been listening to
this, are we talking mostly the same

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,890
equipment, same supplies?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,490
- Right? Maybe some beakers, maybe some
pipettes and some base? Right? Okay, is

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,590
this similar to, Juan's? This one is,
right? So maybe we can start grouping

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,920
these two together. Christina.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,589
- The goal of my investigation is to
determine which laundry detergent is most

10
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:51,490
effective, Tide, Clorox, or OxyClean by
determining which is most basic.

11
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,280
- Any concerns? Yeah? Adrian?

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,436
- How do you know that the most effective
detergents are gonna be the most basic?

13
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:04,117
Maybe there's some other factors that go
into that and they're, it's just,

14
00:01:04,117 --> 00:01:09,493
basic-ness.
- Juan?

15
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:13,621
- That some of them have really strong
bases and maybe the vapors, I mean, Some

16
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:17,653
of them have safety warnings that say
like, don't get too close to the vapors

17
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,509
that come out.

18
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,930
- Okay, so there could be some toxic
chemicals that are associated with these

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,850
which is why we shouldn't use them? Is
that what you mean?

20
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,420
- Yeah.

21
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,000
- Okay, okay, we use them in our homes,
but don't bring them to school, right?

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,090
- Yeah, I'm a little concerned too,
about your idea that it's about which one

23
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:51,090
is most basic. Okay? 'Cause the active
ingredient in Clorox, I think, is bleach,

24
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,310
and bleach--
- Sodium hypochlorite.

25
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,890
- Is sodium hypochlorite.

26
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,500
- Which has a pretty interesting smell.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
- I'd stay away from that.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,800
And then we have Tide, right? Tide is
not bleach, all right? I'm not sure what

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,460
the actual detergent, active ingredient
is, but I'm pretty sure it's not bleach.

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,530
So, this is probably going to require some
cleaning up and making sure that we test

31
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,930
something that we can test, and that it
makes sense why we're testing it. Okay?

32
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,300
All right, we'll come back to this.

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,180
- And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays,
so it doesn't matter, it wins anyway.

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,350
- I think he died, didn't he?

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,820
- Yeah he did, it's too bad.

36
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:49,000
- You know, that guy must have made so
much money, I better not complain.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,820
- Adrian! Go ahead.

38
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,690
- I will find the molarity of one of the
magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab

39
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,560
inventory. To do this I'll mix 50
milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,730
milliliters of one molar calcium chloride
in a beaker. I'll mix it to form a

41
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,710
precipitate of calcium sulfate. After as
much precipitate as possible has formed

42
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,010
I'll weigh the precipitate and calculate
the molarity of the magnesium sulfate

43
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,620
solution with the data collected.

44
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,430
- Any ideas? Jimmy?

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,100
- I'm kinda wondering why it's important
to you, like you said, to make the lab

46
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,600
meaningful.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,170
- Yeah, it should be. So Adrian, do you
have a response?

48
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,740
- It's just 'cause bottles that don't have
molarity kind of annoy me, and I feel like

49
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,320
I should, there should be like a label
that says the molarity, I just kinda...

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,410
- You know my room is open fifth period
every day, you can come on in and do these

51
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,570
experiments and get them so that you know
their concentrations.

52
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,655
- I don't have a free fifth period.

53
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:58,330
- After school's fine too.
- That's cool, that's cool.

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:04,510
- What concerns me is, I thought the
theme was titration, right? Is the theme

55
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:12,450
titration? Okay, where is the titration
aspect to this? Do you know what I'm

56
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,000
asking here?

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
- Yeah, I know, I just didn't realize.

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,290
- Because you're mixing, you're doing a
precipitate reaction, everybody see it

59
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:25,490
that way. I think you're doing a
precipitate reaction and, so I just feel

60
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:32,210
like, you know, this, you had the wrong
theme going on here. Anyway, we'll move

61
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:44,810
on. Nicholas, Artel, Artel. Sirhan Sirhan,
although he was a bad man, though I think,

62
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,450
right? He was accused of being a bad man.
Go ahead!

63
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,000
- The goal of my investigation is to see
which of two pills have more Vitamin C per

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,980
100 milligrams. I will take two different
pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and

65
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,470
cut away mass as appropriate, crush them,
dissolve in water and use a base to

66
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,840
titrate it. I would also use a pH sensor
to see what the solution, to see when the

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,500
solution is at seven, to see when it's
neutralized. Doing this will let me know

68
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,940
which company I should buy from for my
Vitamin C pills.

69
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,500
- What do you guys think? Vitamin C is
ascorbic acid, I don't know if you wrote

70
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:33,790
that. Did you? No, okay, so if it's an
acid, you can titrate it, right? Is

71
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,210
anybody concerned about, like, anything
here? Jimmy?

72
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,710
- Don't the pills tell you how much
Vitamin C is in them? Like, the bottle?

73
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:50,500
- Wait, let me make sure, if you buy a
Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of

74
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,280
Vitamin C, my assumption is when you pull
out one of them tablets, and you crush it

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,290
and you do this experiment, it's gonna be
close to that 100 milligrams. So are you

76
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,220
testing because you think they're not
accurate?

77
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,610
- Yeah.

78
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,820
- Oh! Okay, so you're testing for accuracy
on their part, just to keep them honest.

79
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,390
- Because, I mean, 100 milligrams, it's
kind of a, non-specific number.

80
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,310
- All right, Ian?

81
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,320
- Actually, another way you could look at
it is that, just because it says 100

82
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,240
milligrams, that's how much of the Vitamin
C is in it, that's not how big the tablet

83
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,960
is. Being that sometime, I mean you could
have, and say, just arbitrary numbers, you

84
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,840
could have a 500 milligram tablet that has
that 100 milligrams of vitamin C, or you

85
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,480
could have a 200 milligram tablet with
that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C, so

86
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,400
you might wanna know which one actually
had more stuff in it, actually had more

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,724
stuff in it per, density.

88
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:56,380
- Okay but, is that what you want him to
do, I thought, are you doing it because you

89
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,280
wanna make sure that when they write 100,
you don't care how big this tablet is,

90
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,140
unless, unless, what's the danger here?
Some of that other that tablet contains,

91
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,300
acids or bases in them, then that would
affect your results, right?

92
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,060
- One of them I have is pretty pure, it's
pretty much just ascorbic acid, the other

93
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,470
company I have does have some other stuff
in it, so I was wondering if anybody else

94
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,820
had like one that was mostly Vitamin C.

95
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,830
- Have you ever been to like, the CVS and
looked in the section--

96
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,900
- I mean, I could find one I just
haven't--

97
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,150
- There's a bunch, you could even--

98
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,090
- What'd you guys figure out?

99
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:44,020
- It's turning yellow.

100
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,640
- Why do you think it's doing that?

101
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,880
- Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves,
gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic. I

102
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,140
didn't think it would be that big of a
deal because--

103
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,000
- Wait! Hang on, so you mean, so far what
you've done is you've crushed these things

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,480
you tried to dissolve them and you added
some bromothymol blue?

105
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,950
- Yeah.

106
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,410
- And, that bromothymol blue is not quite
the color that you want?

107
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,330
- That's right.
- That's what you're saying?

108
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,270
- Yeah.

109
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,250
- What color should it be?

110
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:27,240
- Blue, I guess. It's kind of, green. It
just looks as if this coloring is just,

111
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,660
green dye.

112
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,270
- Have you thought about using like
phenolphthalein? That has a distinctly

113
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,720
pink color, otherwise it's clear.

114
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,610
- No, we did not think of that.

115
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,160
- You wanna try that?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:49,080
- Yeah, that'd be better.
[Background Chatter]

117
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:58,120
- So, the phenolphthalein is gonna be,
it's probably going to be behind... -

118
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,880
If it's pink it's acidic right?

119
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:08,080
- No, if it's basic.
[Background Chatter]

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,520
- Do the bubbles matter?

121
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,870
- All right, could I just stop and ask you
guys, did you guys get your color change

122
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,620
you were looking for?
- Yeah.

123
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,070
- So the titration is working out?

124
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,710
- [together] Yep.
- Very clean.

125
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,730
- What? So, tell me what you got here?

126
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,250
- This is a disinfecting Clorox, we're
just starting out, we're just trying to

127
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,080
measure out 10 milliliters. That one we're
done with, we got it to the brown, like,

128
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,830
it didn't stir anymore, that was it.

129
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,660
- That's as far as it went?

130
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,170
- We put in 61 and that was it. Now we're
going to start this one. And that worked

131
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:39,780
with the one molar.

132
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,320
- So is this, oh, so this is a different
concentration? Or how is this one

133
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,870
different, this is just a different--

134
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,930
- This is a different type, and it's a
different percentage of the hypochlorate.

135
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,780
- That's disinfecting spray and that's
bleach.

136
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,610
- With a different type of Clorox cleaning
product.

137
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,070
- All right. Did you make sure that mixing
some of these would not produce anything

138
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,220
poisonous?

139
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,990
- No, we did not make sure. But they're--

140
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,810
- I just wanna, you know, we don't wanna
create any of these strange gases coming

141
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,220
out of here.

142
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,050
- When we looked at the reaction this is
the reaction that they showed on the

143
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,410
thing. And this was fine, like it said it
should be done in basic and everything.

144
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,990
- Okay.
- God bless you.

145
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,774
- Excuse me.

146
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:41,000
[Background Chatter]

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,110
- How's everything going?

148
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,500
- Not good with this one.

149
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,730
- What's in there?
- It's red wine vinegar.

150
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,570
- But it hasn't changed color.

151
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,420
- The treatment's too powerful.

152
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,050
- Yeah, we're thinking it's too...

153
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,330
- So, we're gonna do the white--

154
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,190
- What's the solution to that, then? Why
don't you just use less?

155
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,030
- Less of the vinegar?

156
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,120
- Right. All right?

157
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,780
- So we use five milliliters instead of
10.

158
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,720
- Well, I mean, right? If you use less,
then don't you think you'll be able to

159
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,500
titrate it--
- Easier.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,980
- Well, you'd need less base to get there.

161
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,850
- Right.
- Okay.

162
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:33,630
- Let's go over here, see what happens over here.
[Background Chatter]

163
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,460
- So, squeeze that out.

164
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:47,075
- What are you guys, so you've got Vitamin
C, crushed in there, you used, is this

165
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:48,803
bromothymol blue, what did you use?

166
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:52,090
- Yeah, we used BTB, and now we're gonna
see how much base we used.

167
00:11:52,090 --> 00:12:03,377
- Just out of curiosity, why did you use a
graduat--, what is this about, 50? You

168
00:12:03,377 --> 00:12:05,520
didn't want to use like... 'Cause
that is, are you gonna--

169
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,000
- All the other ones were like dirty.

170
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,990
- Yeah, they were kinda...

171
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,779
- And I think this is accurate to two sig
figs which is our experiment's limit.

172
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:23,000
[Background Chatter]

173
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,340
- All right, coming along okay it looks
like.

174
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:41,241
- [together] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,

175
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:44,057
20.
- Hi!

176
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:47,033
- You're adding 20 drops of bromothymol
blue?

177
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,433
- Yeah. Is that too much?

178
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:56,121
- Well, has it occurred to you, and it
probably hasn't, it's okay, bromothymol

179
00:12:56,121 --> 00:13:04,089
blue itself is either a weak, my guess is
it's a weak acid, it could be a weak base,

180
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:10,777
but all indicators are going to be weak
acids and bases. So, we always want to use

181
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:16,025
a bare minimum amount. Therefore, how
about if you use something that has a

182
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:23,161
distinct color change, roughly at the,
neutral point, like phenolphthalein.

183
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:27,417
'Cause then it'll go from pink,
your...

184
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,401
- This is acid.

185
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:32,440
- These are acids, so they'll go from
clear to a pinkish color.

186
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,233
- Okay, okay, but do you think the pink
will be able to be seen?

187
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:41,273
- Well--
- Like the blue one?

188
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:48,152
- You know, the blue you need to use a lot
more to get there, although, I don't know,

189
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:51,033
I suppose since you already did this one--

190
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:53,113
- I mean, we could remeasure, out--

191
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:57,340
- You may wanna, well, we don't want to
run out of time here, so, right? Stay

192
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,120
consistent and then consider it, how you
can make improvements later.

193
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,710
- Okay.

194
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,251
- All right?

195
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:18,000
[Background Chatter] [clapping and laughter]

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
- Now that's very nice.

197
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:22,453
- You guys have questions?

198
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:28,885
- What was your results in comparing what
the company says and what you--

199
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:33,909
- There was a little bit less, since we
used 500 milligrams and the company

200
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:40,520
labeled it as pretty much pure, pure
ascorbic acid. As in the first trials it

201
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:47,100
was around 480 per kil to, which is, it's
pretty close and the other one was around

202
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,190
410, 400.so I mean it's a little bit less
than what you're probably paying for.

203
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,470
But--

204
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,910
- But that's, then again, it could've
been, because--

205
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,600
- Because not all the powder dissolved,
some of it was still settled on the

206
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,860
bottom.
- So they could be really accurate?

207
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,440
- Yeah they could be, you know, dead on.

208
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,480
- For the trials, did you guys use
different amounts of stuff, for the two

209
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,840
trials?

210
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,970
- For the first two trials we used 500
milligrams of powder for each pill, and

211
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,790
then, for the third trial we used 100,
right? A hundred.

212
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,470
- And then for those trials, like the
third one you said you used a different

213
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,370
concentration of NaOH?
- Yeah.

214
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,280
- Why did you use a different
concentration?

215
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,890
- First of all there wasn't much left of
the .567, and also, you know, who's to--,

216
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,120
you know, maybe that could've been
contaminated, it might not have been .567,

217
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,180
so it's also good to use some different
stuff sometimes.

218
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,540
- Right.

219
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,950
- You can't always base it, you can't have
it all on one thing.

220
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,710
- Yeah, that's smart.

221
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,180
- How did yo actually figure out the
amounts? What was the math?

222
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,240
- [together] Oh!
- We did the stoichiometry.

223
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,990
- Yeah, but we assumed that it was a
one-to-one ratio, one hydrogen ion

224
00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,410
dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one
OH from the base. And so we just

225
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,190
calculated moles and changed moles to
grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C.

226
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,800
- Do you know with certainty that ascorbic
acid is one H plus?

227
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,805
- No we just assumed that, for the
experiment.

228
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:15,957
- Maybe you should look that up.

229
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:16,981
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

230
00:16:16,981 --> 00:16:22,140
- The other thing, anybody else? So the
other thing is, and I just wanna make

231
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:28,545
sure, when you said 500 milligrams, that's
.5 grams, right?

232
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,380
- We did it accurate with--

233
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:35,440
- Yeah, 'cause that thing, the scales here
give you two sig figs, right? Okay, I mean

234
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,240
to the hundredths, hundredths of a gram,
right? So you crush this thing and you

235
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,180
weighed out .50?
- [together] Yeah.

236
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:52,150
- That's what you did it? How much was
left in the... ; I mean, of one tablet,

237
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,200
when you, you know what I mean? When you
crush it?

238
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,130
- Yeah--
- How much--

239
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:00,050
- We had excess, I mean, one of the pills
I had was 1000 milligrams, so we, you

240
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,730
know, we had about, we had a, like, about,
500--

241
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,250
- It is my fault for--

242
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,680
- Oh, you were using 1000 milligram
tablets.

243
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,820
- And then my pill was 500 milligrams and
then we weighed them and it was actually

244
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,140
six five seven, like milligrams.

245
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,300
- That's how we removed--
- So we had to-- we removed mass.

246
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:21,340
- Oh, well how 'bout this, if it, if they
say 500, but the thing weighs six...

247
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,750
What'd you say, six or seven hundred?

248
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,550
- Oh yeah.

249
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,530
- Then, aren't there other ingredients
already in there?

250
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,230
- Not that were listed, like--

251
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,240
- Yeah, they weren't listed--

252
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,460
- It just said, it just said Vitamin C--

253
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,620
- Because they might just list the active
ingredient, right?

254
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,250
- Yeah.

255
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,900
- In other words, if the pill itself
weighs more than the 500 that they claim,

256
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,650
my guess would be there's more of
something else.

257
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:48,940
- Okay.

258
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:56,780
- Because here's another thing. Don't you
need possibly a binding agent to keep all

259
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,660
the Vitamin C in a clump? Do you see what
I'm saying?

260
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,810
- [together] Yeah , yeah.

261
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,510
- And they'll typically use, some, there's
gonna be some certain chemicals they're

262
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:11,600
gonna use that's in there. So I have a
feeling before you write the company, be

263
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
careful, they're--
- [together] Yeah, yeah.

264
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,660
- They probably added other ingredients.

265
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,380
- Yeah.

266
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,520
- Because what I think might've been even
better is if they claim 500, then why

267
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,200
don't you just crush the whole thing,
regardless of how much it weighs? And then

268
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,740
titrate that. You see what I'm saying?

269
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,190
- [together] Yes.

270
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,840
- 'Cause then, they're claiming there's
500 in this thing, let's see, based on

271
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,150
the... You see what I'm saying?

272
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,190
- So that would be taking further just
simply--

273
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,210
- Yeah, that would be--
- The experiment.

274
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,227
- Wouldn't that be like the next--
- Yeah.

275
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:48,063
- Thing that you could try? Same thing
with 1000, right? I mean if they

276
00:18:48,063 --> 00:18:49,260
claim 1000.
- Yeah.

277
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,000
- Go crush the whole thing and see what--
