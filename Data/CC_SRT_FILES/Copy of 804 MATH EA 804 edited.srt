1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,467
- Anybody tell me how much
cases usually run?

2
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:04,394
[Background Chatter]

3
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:06,925
- At Radio Shack, they're 30 dollars.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:08,713
- Okay, you know what?

5
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:11,199
So we'll factor that in in a minute.

6
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,268
But Alex, you had your hand raised.

7
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,473
So I'd like to hear from you.

8
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,517
- I was just gonna say that
the 199,

9
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,004
tax is gonna come in anyway,

10
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:18,397
so [inaudible]

11
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:21,670
- What if you got a deal
about it that paid

12
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,202
the tax and shipping?

13
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,465
[Background Chatter]

14
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,261
- Okay, hold up.

15
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,584
Cynthia.

16
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:33,715
- But even though...

17
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,298
Even though if you use 12,

18
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:38,852
you're only gonna have a
couple dollars left over.

19
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,499
With the economy these days,

20
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,799
things are not cheap.

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,005
So you can't buy something
with five dollars.

22
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:46,955
You're not gonna get
a case for that cheap.

23
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:48,070
- That's probably right.

24
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,974
[Background Chatter]

25
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:51,297
- I'm gonna hear two more of you,

26
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:52,807
and then I have something I wanna drop

27
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:54,275
into this conversation that several

28
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:55,646
of you talked about,

29
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,271
and I think is really
important to point out.

30
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:59,013
So I wanna hear what you
two have to say,

31
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:00,638
and then I'm gonna go
back to something

32
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:02,170
several of you kinda mentioned.

33
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,890
Go ahead.

34
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,351
- It's better to have more money
than less money

35
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:09,147
because if you exactly calculate it to...

36
00:01:09,147 --> 00:01:11,367
199,

37
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:15,883
then you'd still have zero dollars left,

38
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:19,764
but it's better to have
equal or more money.

39
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,062
- Okay, that's, you know I think you're right.

40
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:24,222
That seems like it just
makes sense, right?

41
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,753
And one more, yeah.

42
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,609
- Actually, when I bought my phone,

43
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:32,673
I got a case just for
about five dollars on ebay.

44
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,276
- Ebay, so you got a used one?

45
00:01:34,276 --> 00:01:35,599
- And it paid for shipping,

46
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,247
so I didn't, yes I did.

47
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,339
- Okay well you know what?

48
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:39,384
I wanna talk about that

49
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:41,056
because that's actually
what you guys just said

50
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:41,914
is really important,

51
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:43,864
and several of you others mentioned it.

52
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,235
Maybe we don't want,

53
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,441
maybe I don't want to have
the exactly the price,

54
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,848
maybe I want to have at least...

55
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,362
200 dollars.

56
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:58,167
And if I say I wanna have
at least 200 dollars,

57
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:01,906
is there a way to say at
least with math symbols?

58
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:04,159
To make that equation
change so it says least.

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,389
'Cause right now, it says equal.

60
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,293
Is there a way to do
it so it says at least?

61
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,208
Colin?

62
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,613
- If you, you need to get
the iPhone and the case

63
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:16,469
in the same shipping order,

64
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,373
or else it's gonna cost
more for shipping.

65
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:19,487
- Oh okay.

66
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,043
So yeah, I need at least
a certain amount.

67
00:02:21,043 --> 00:02:22,064
- Yeah.

68
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,643
So you're gonna [inaudible].

69
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,874
- Wanna jump in on that, guys?

70
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,942
- You need to put the greater than

71
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,039
or equal to sign.

72
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,756
- But what does that look like?

73
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:33,192
- The greater than sign
with a line under it.

74
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,261
- Okay.

75
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,554
And what's the word in
English that we have

76
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,389
for that symbol?

77
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,686
Yeah, say it again, Alexis.

78
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:45,429
- That least.

79
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:46,520
- It is.

80
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,833
So now, how much do
I need to save to get

81
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,455
at least 200 dollars, right?

82
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,450
So it's okay if I have
exactly or more than.

83
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,772
So that kinda talks about what
you guys are talking about.

84
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:00,189
Maybe I need more money,

85
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:02,719
if she wants more,
more than just a phone.

86
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,066
I'm sure she does, right?

87
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,615
- With the...

88
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:10,301
[inaudible]

89
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,725
What about the [inaudible]

90
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,815
just come with the phone.

91
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:17,533
Just that, or does it
come with something else?

92
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,462
Like a...

93
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:21,039
Charger, battery, or even a case itself.

94
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,552
- So again you're saying

95
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:24,410
I need at least 200 dollars, right?

96
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,919
Depending on what comes with the phone.

97
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,916
- [inaudible] like a Christmas special?

98
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,239
Like half off or something?

99
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,944
[Background Chatter]

100
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:38,286
- What you can...

101
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:41,613
Also think is where you gonna buy it?

102
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:46,190
And where is there's no tax and stuff?

103
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,439
So, it depends on where
you're gonna buy it.

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,689
If you want no tax, that means
like on Ebay or something,

105
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,761
but... [inaudible]

106
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:59,795
It might be 50 percent
off and stuff like that.

107
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:01,397
- Okay, interesting.

108
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:02,326
- I'm just saying,

109
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,367
it depends where you're gonna buy

110
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:05,833
your phone.

111
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,644
- Okay, no, I like that a lot.

112
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:10,825
- When I was doing my equation,

113
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,828
11 times 11,

114
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:15,869
I got 121.

115
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:18,493
So you would still have
a dollar left over.

116
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:22,671
And you know how Cassidy said that she can

117
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,375
get it on Ebay, that much.

118
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,938
Most people, they...

119
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:27,568
I understand that it's cheap,

120
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,798
and most people want it like that,

121
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:32,863
but I bought stuff off the line before,

122
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:34,674
and some of the stuff does work good,

123
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,181
and some of 'em you
drop them and it breaks.

124
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:39,248
So, it's not always good.

125
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:41,036
- Somethin' to pay attention to.

126
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,566
All right, I'm gonna change
the conversation a little bit

127
00:04:43,566 --> 00:04:46,144
because I think you guys are
doing really really well.

128
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,862
Let's go with what you guys said

129
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:50,532
and say I need at least 200 dollars.

130
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:52,459
If that's true,

131
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,386
is there any way to find out,

132
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:56,384
or to answer the original question,

133
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:57,197
which Nick brought up.

134
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,146
How much money do I need
to save each day

135
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:01,677
based on what we have so far?

136
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,256
Where do I go from here?

137
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:05,624
- There is a way to solve it.

138
00:05:05,624 --> 00:05:08,387
You grab 200 dollars,

139
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,081
and then you subtract 80 from it.

140
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,335
- Okay, I'm gonna stop
you right there.

141
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,542
I don't mean to interrupt.

142
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,772
Katherine, you're watching
this and I saw your paper,

143
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:18,023
what do you think about
what Najeem just said?

144
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,906
- Like [inaudible]

145
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:23,591
- Okay, and why is that?

146
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,849
- I don't know.

147
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,857
That's how you solve it in equality.

148
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:34,901
- Okay, so can you repeat
what you said?

149
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,524
- You subtract 80 from both sides.

150
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:39,405
- Okay.

151
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,310
I'm gonna go ahead and do
that right now.

152
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,386
And what does that leave us with?

153
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:52,594
- 120.

154
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:54,033
- And you know what,

155
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:54,683
I have a question.

156
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:56,378
What does that 120 represent?

157
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,050
I mean, if 200 is how
much the phone costs,

158
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,467
what's 120 about?

159
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,442
I'm not sure.

160
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,624
- How much you need to raise,

161
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:03,530
until then.

162
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,039
- Okay, okay.

163
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,827
And Nayanna?

164
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:08,406
Can you comment on what you think

165
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:10,263
might be the next step?

166
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:15,511
- Divide 12 from 120.

167
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:16,742
- Again.

168
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:18,994
- Divide 12 from 120.

169
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:20,271
- Okay.

170
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,752
And, somebody else, jump in.

171
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:27,120
- The answer was [inaudible].

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,164
The answer would be 10

173
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:32,066
because 12 and 120 equals 10.

174
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,667
- Okay, and Katie you were
ready to say something.

175
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:35,711
What would you say?

176
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:39,408
- I was about to say [inaudible].

177
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,584
- Equals 10.

178
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,372
X equals 10 and--

179
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:46,898
[Background Chatter]

180
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:50,177
- X equals at least 10.

181
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,640
- Oh, it was so you're not liking what

182
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,731
I wrote over here, Alexis.

183
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,030
- At least 'cause
you have to keep the

184
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,048
[inaudible] all the way down.

185
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:59,186
- Okay, Katherine,

186
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,626
what do you think?

187
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,692
- I agree with Alexis

188
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,335
because...

189
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,677
it can't just like change,

190
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,210
because...

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,847
- When you say it can't change,

192
00:07:12,847 --> 00:07:13,485
what do you mean?

193
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:14,484
- the side.

194
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,202
- Oh [laughs]

195
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,013
Okay, that's good [laughs].

196
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:20,265
I didn't know what it was
I'm just asking.

197
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:23,307
- And then you
have to put what X means.

198
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:30,148
[Background Chatter]

199
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:35,279
- Oh, Oh.

200
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,049
Oh, so what is the label?

201
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:38,744
What are the units we're talkin' about?

202
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:41,246
[Background Chatter]

203
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:42,361
Ah.

204
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:45,939
- [inaudible] the blue tooth.

205
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:48,841
If you wanna have a little extra money,

206
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:50,536
you could have more, and plus,

207
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,650
if you get a little extra money one day,

208
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,530
but you have the same another,

209
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,782
and you get a little less the next day,

210
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:58,593
you could raise up for another day.

211
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,172
- Oh, like if I'm going
to collect cans

212
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,938
and I don't collect as many cans one day,

213
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:03,771
but I collect extra the next day.

214
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,048
- Yeah, like that.

215
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,511
- Nayanna, you had your hand raised.

216
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:09,854
- When you have to add 40 to 200,

217
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,178
for the Bluetooth.

218
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:12,919
- Ah, that's an interesting idea.

219
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,009
So maybe we, so tell me what to write.

220
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:19,096
Instead of this, how would you change this

221
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:20,976
to incorporate what you just said?

222
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:24,041
- 80 plus X equals 240.

223
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,927
- Okay, are you pleased,

224
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,482
are you okay with that?

225
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,038
- I disagree.

226
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:35,803
- Cynthia.

227
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:39,912
- I disagree with
your answer on that one.

228
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:43,334
I don't agree that it's 10 because

229
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,544
if like they were saying

230
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:47,777
earlier if you wanted some extra money,

231
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,855
you would...

232
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:50,313
You should...

233
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:52,694
You should do 11

234
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:56,617
for a day because if
you do you'll get 132,

235
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:59,010
and then you'll have extra money.

236
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,762
- Okay.

237
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:03,265
[Background Chatter]

238
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,653
- But that's the problem [inaudible].

239
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,443
- What do you mean when you
say it's not asking?

240
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:12,254
- Well, it's not asking
for extra money,

241
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:15,360
or anything, it's just asking how many...

242
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,059
How much money you need per day.

243
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:19,423
[Background Chatter]

244
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,260
- Anthony, I noticed you've
got some stuff

245
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,980
written down.

246
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,855
What do you think about...

247
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,509
I wanna go back to what Nayanna said.

248
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,063
She says she's gonna
change the equation here,

249
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,107
and she put 240 up there, why?

250
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,732
Why did she do that, and
do you agree with that?

251
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:36,331
- Yeah, 'cause then you
would have a little

252
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,655
extra money left.

253
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:38,514
- A little bit.

254
00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:39,332
- You would have a little bit

255
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:40,179
of extra money left.

256
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:40,587
- Okay.

257
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:44,770
- [inaudible] like
the Bluetooth in the case,

258
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:45,889
maybe?

259
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,548
- Okay.

260
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:48,883
- Isn't this another problem?

261
00:09:48,883 --> 00:09:52,174
Another problem [inaudible]

262
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,148
not a part of this one yet?

263
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:55,865
- Yeah, 'cause they're
not asking how

264
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,119
much extra money do you need.

265
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,348
This problem, this question's
not asking how much

266
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,414
extra do you need for
a Bluetooth, also.

267
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:01,926
- Okay.

268
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,063
- How much are the phone and Bluetooth,

269
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:04,386
it's just asking for the phone.

270
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:04,945
- Okay.

271
00:10:04,945 --> 00:10:06,772
[Background Chatter]

272
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:10,557
- I think because...

273
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,482
The question wasn't asking to

274
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,623
bring extra money into it.

275
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,454
We just brought the
extra money to round the,

276
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,852
make the equation easier
and round the

277
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:25,972
199.99 to 200,

278
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:27,991
and extra money is okay,

279
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:30,545
but we shouldn't change the equation.

280
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:32,915
'Cause it's not asking you to.

281
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:33,843
- Okay.

282
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:36,165
- This question isn't saying
anything about

283
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:37,930
case or a Bluetooth yet,

284
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,252
it's a yes question.

285
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:40,762
And this question talks about Bluetooth.

286
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:42,945
- Okay, so what
I kinda like is you guys

287
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,640
were doin' this problem,

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,473
and a couple of ya jumped
ahead to this problem,

289
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:48,146
which is no problem at all.

290
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,737
Let's jump ahead just for a
minute and assume that I did

291
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:53,167
want to get the Bluetooth.

292
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,350
Would this be the equation to represent?

293
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,581
And before I answer this question,

294
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:57,672
what I would like to do,

295
00:10:57,672 --> 00:11:00,272
I'm gonna call on Olivia, and
then I'm gonna have everybody

296
00:11:00,272 --> 00:11:02,664
switch so the pilots go
back to the co-pilots,

297
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:04,126
and the pilots come up, but not yet.

298
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:05,387
Let's hear what Olivia has to say.

299
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:09,009
- Would it be [inaudible] equals 12 X,

300
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:11,191
if you wanted to get it before Christmas?

301
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,631
Or would it be after?

302
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,187
- One more time,
I could barely hear ya.

303
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:16,067
- Would we still get
that before Christmas,

304
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,484
or would it be after?

305
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:18,831
- Before, before.

306
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,386
- So would it be 12?

307
00:11:20,386 --> 00:11:21,686
- Comments on that?

308
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:23,358
- I agree with that.

309
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:25,117
[Background Chatter]

310
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,679
- Thumbs up if you think 12,

311
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,158
thumbs down if you think no,
we don't need 12 on this one.

312
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:31,422
Okay, Adrian, you have something?

313
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,377
- We need to know how much money

314
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:35,049
you earned each day.

315
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:36,721
- Well that's...

316
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:39,750
What do you guys think
about that question?

317
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,549
- Well that's what we're
finding out right now.

318
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:44,307
- I know, but how much you earn.

319
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:45,747
That's how much he has to save.

320
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,580
- Pilots, switch with

321
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,479
somebody in the back.

322
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,473
[Background Chatter]

323
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:16,158
All right, here we go.

324
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:20,198
So now, I have a question for you.

325
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:23,800
Can everybody turn around
for just a minute please?

326
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,412
Thank you.

327
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,526
Question for you.

328
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:28,708
If I wanted to graph
our first solution

329
00:12:30,388 --> 00:12:31,796
on a number line,

330
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:33,792
what might that graph look like?

331
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,533
So will you guys agree that okay,

332
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,206
we need to earn a minimum amount.

333
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:39,040
And at least 10 dollars a day,

334
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,573
but if I wanted to graph that,

335
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,963
put that on a number line
represent that graphically,

336
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,263
what would that look like?

337
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:49,692
- It would be like a...

338
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,828
It would be [inaudible].

339
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:55,288
But the circle...

340
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:57,678
[inaudible]

341
00:12:58,428 --> 00:12:59,821
- What kind of circle?

342
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,378
I didn't hear you.

343
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:01,405
- Shaded.

344
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,798
- So you want to put this up here?

345
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:04,540
- Yeah.

346
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,509
[inaudible]

347
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:09,161
- Amarra, I'd like to hear
your opinion on that.

348
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:15,157
- I don't, I never understood
the shaded thing.

349
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,759
I don't know why it's shaded.

350
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:19,684
- It's shaded because it's not,

351
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:23,352
I think if it's not shaded
it means greater than,

352
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:26,186
I mean greater or less than.

353
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:29,993
But when it's shaded I think [inaudible].

354
00:13:29,993 --> 00:13:32,455
It means equal to or less than or...

355
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:34,144
With.

356
00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:36,797
- Okay, Tara, do you wanna
contribute to that

357
00:13:36,797 --> 00:13:39,956
[inaudible]

358
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:45,248
- Well, whenever it says greater than,

359
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:46,757
or equal to,

360
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:49,589
the dotted means it could
be 10 because it could

361
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,097
be equal to, or greater than,

362
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,885
which is over 10.

363
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,720
But greater than or less than

364
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,598
can't be that number so
it has to be open circle.

365
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,872
And than greater than or equal to.

366
00:14:02,872 --> 00:14:05,030
- Anybody have an example of a problem

367
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,584
or words that we would
use to put an open circle,

368
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:08,607
unshaded circle?

369
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:10,580
In real life, what might we say

370
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,035
for something to represent
an unshaded circle?

371
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,496
- Go ahead, Al.

372
00:14:15,595 --> 00:14:18,335
- Fewer than 14 students
have mechanical pencils.

373
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:19,589
- A little louder.

374
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,817
- I got fewer than 14 students
have mechanical pencils.

375
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,998
- So in that problem,

376
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,785
could 14 students have
mechanical pencils,

377
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,480
if you have fewer than 14?

378
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,687
- No.

379
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:31,918
- So that would be unshaded.

380
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,845
'Cause 14 doesn't count.

381
00:14:34,865 --> 00:14:37,766
So in this question, Amarra,
the least number of money

382
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,654
I should save per day is how much?

383
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:43,361
- I think 10 is

384
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,073
a good answer.

385
00:14:45,073 --> 00:14:49,084
because it does go into the number.

386
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,807
- And so would be shaded or unshaded?

387
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,457
- Shaded.

388
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,197
- Oh, is that the only
number amount of money

389
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:56,520
I should save each day?

390
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,147
Is that it?

391
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,005
Are their other possibilities out?

392
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,240
- Yeah, you could do--
