1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:03,349
- Consider what you read
about organic lettuce

2
00:00:03,349 --> 00:00:05,653
and Rosie from Omnivore's Dilemma

3
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,839
and from what you're reading
do you feel it's worth

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,106
the extra cost and effort to eat organic?

5
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:13,610
Yes?

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,452
- So, for some organics
I believe it is worth it

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,732
and others I don't.

8
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:22,111
Industrial organic I don't
believe it's worth it,

9
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:27,111
because for the lettuce in
the book Omnivore's Dilemma,

10
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:31,241
they said it takes about ten
fossil fuel calories to make

11
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:33,864
one calorie from lettuce,

12
00:00:33,864 --> 00:00:37,352
and I don't believe that's
energy efficient at all.

13
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:41,683
But other farms, other industries,

14
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:46,333
or other organic farms
like Polyface Farms,

15
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:51,179
they use all natural energy,

16
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:54,513
not a lot of fossil fuels go into it,

17
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,037
and I think it's more efficient.

18
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:59,589
So, organic like that I believe is better,

19
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:01,951
but industrial organic I
don't believe is better.

20
00:01:03,023 --> 00:01:04,154
- That's a good point.

21
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,519
I was wondering is somebody could

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,514
expand on the difference between

23
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:10,639
industrial organic and organic.

24
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:12,303
Phil, if you want to pick someone.

25
00:01:12,303 --> 00:01:13,380
- Eli.

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,695
- So, normal organic food, like

27
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:18,297
what started the idea of organic food,

28
00:01:18,297 --> 00:01:21,017
was completely different from organic food

29
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:23,748
that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays.

30
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:27,790
Like, what the people originally
thought the concept of

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,475
organic food thought of

32
00:01:29,475 --> 00:01:32,419
was like the local, sustainable
farm like Polyface Farms,

33
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:36,056
where it's completely energy
efficient and they use

34
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:39,351
all natural resources like grass

35
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:41,804
and just stuff like that to feed

36
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,001
their cows and other animals.

37
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,294
But industrial organic systems,

38
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:47,819
it's pretty much the same as

39
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:50,155
normal industrial food system, except

40
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:54,549
they don't use antibiotics or
pesticides to make their food.

41
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,450
They still have animal rights...

42
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,606
There's still animal
cruelty and stuff inside the

43
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:04,078
the factories, and stuff like that.

44
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,516
Araceli.

45
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,990
- I agree with Eli, because
when I read organic,

46
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,782
I thought organic was good.

47
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,894
But then basically it was the same thing.

48
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:15,518
Like the chickens, they
still got fed corn,

49
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,118
but they had an open door,

50
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:19,048
but they were so fat
they couldn't go through.

51
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,022
Like, why pay the extra money

52
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:23,176
for something that's
going to be exactly the same

53
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,271
as the other thing?

54
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:29,128
- I think it is worth buying organic food.

55
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:31,538
Because even though the
animals are treated the same,

56
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:33,618
and even though it still
wastes a lot of fossil fuel,

57
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:35,911
we save a lot of farmland
from being put, like,

58
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:37,458
pesticide and everything on it,

59
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,367
so we could have chemical free land.

60
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,002
And also we save our
water system from being

61
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,900
poisoned by the chemicals we use.

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,417
So, it might cost a little bit more,

63
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,001
but it's worth it.

64
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:49,383
Matt.

65
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:51,633
- In response to, I guess, Eli,

66
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,500
it's not exactly the same,

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,486
there are definitely the perks
to the industrial organic

68
00:02:56,486 --> 00:03:00,219
system with the lack of
chemicals and hormones.

69
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,907
But yes, I can definitely agree that

70
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:04,698
it's a very similar thing,

71
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,096
it doesn't solve all the problems

72
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,234
with the industrial system.

73
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,091
- I don't agree with what was just said,

74
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:16,656
that when you farm without
pesticides it's better,

75
00:03:16,656 --> 00:03:19,418
because in Omnivore's Dilemma,

76
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:21,764
even though they farm without pesticides,

77
00:03:21,764 --> 00:03:23,727
they crowd the ground so much

78
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:25,476
that it destroys the land.

79
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,631
So, it's not necessarily better,

80
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,726
it just sounds better.

81
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:35,151
- I just like Simone's
point, because I think that

82
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:38,745
a lot of the problems are still there,

83
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,017
and even though it might
be a little bit better

84
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:43,096
without the pesticides, I
think it's still important

85
00:03:43,096 --> 00:03:46,446
to eat real organic food.

86
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:48,216
I think that would be the best.

87
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:50,712
Industrial organic is a
step in the right direction,

88
00:03:50,712 --> 00:03:52,482
but I don't think it's
close enough to where

89
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,143
we should be with our food system.

90
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:01,153
- I agree with Molly that
industrial organic foods,

91
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,022
on the face, are both...

92
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,398
They're worth paying for because

93
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:06,944
they're the food that we should be eating,

94
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,629
but in other ways they feed

95
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:10,176
into other problems with pollution.

96
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,413
If you want the right type of food,

97
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,504
you have to create a food
system that can sustain

98
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,807
a country as large as the United States,

99
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:19,295
but still has healthy animals.

100
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:23,242
And animals that have evolved to eat,

101
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:27,369
only being fed, that is
at a cost low enough

102
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:28,969
to feed everyone in the United States

103
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:30,926
like we are fed now.

104
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,740
- I was going to also ask a
couple personal questions,

105
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,649
since I was talking to your mom about

106
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,497
how does your eating habits
change, do you think,

107
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:41,534
now that you feel like
you're more aware, or...?

108
00:04:41,534 --> 00:04:44,947
- She says that she always
bought grass fed beef,

109
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:49,491
and I try to eat healthy,

110
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:52,850
but in the case of fast food, of course,

111
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,653
I go and eat fast food.

112
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,317
But lately I've been badgering her,

113
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,856
and asking her if she
could get a grass fed steak.

114
00:04:58,856 --> 00:05:00,529
I've been waiting for
that for a long time.

115
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,773
The corn fed steak that my dad gives me

116
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:06,849
smells bad and it looks bad, so...

117
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,864
(mumbles)

118
00:05:09,222 --> 00:05:10,667
Anyway.

119
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,123
There's nobody asking.

120
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:18,022
- I don't think organic's really
necessarily healthy for us,

121
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:22,267
because humans are still
trying to figure out

122
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:26,384
what vitamins we still need,
what essentials we still need.

123
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,538
Like people are still
discovering that plants have

124
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,799
certain essentials that
we never knew we needed.

125
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,805
So, how can we tell organic's good for us

126
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:35,972
if we don't know what organic is different

127
00:05:35,972 --> 00:05:39,070
from what we get from normal food?

128
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:43,844
- I thought Curt brought a
good point up too, which is

129
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:48,494
the best organic is just

130
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:52,067
straight from the farm to the buyers,

131
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:56,174
but it is a great point
that Curt and Greg brings up

132
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:59,032
which is that that way can't

133
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:03,651
feed as much people as
the industrial organic

134
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,333
or just industrial food.

135
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,645
- I completely agree with that.

136
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,832
It's implausible to try to

137
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:17,517
make what they call beyond organic food

138
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:21,420
at such a high amount, because it really

139
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,162
consumes a lot of land
and a lot of energy.

140
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:26,806
We read in the Omnivore's Dilemma with the

141
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:29,281
moving the chicken
coops so much every day,

142
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:31,958
that's a lot of land for very little meat,

143
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,401
and honestly that would
not be able to sustain

144
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,780
the whole country.

145
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,814
Lisa?

146
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,681
- So, I kind of agree
with what you're saying,

147
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,592
but it doesn't have to
necessarily be a few big farms

148
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:44,438
that are completely going organic.

149
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,998
If there's little farms
all over the United States,

150
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:50,005
then meat can go to those people 
around there.

151
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:52,607
It might not happen all of a sudden,

152
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:54,549
but little by little people
are going to learn that

153
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:56,020
organic is better.

154
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,005
Whether it's more expensive or not,

155
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:00,490
it's healthier for us
knowing that the animals...

156
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,125
When the animals are not
fed on natural stuff,

157
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,628
that in turn is bad for us.

158
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:10,787
Ashley?

159
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:12,980
- I agree with what everyone said,

160
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,625
and that the point that
Paulina brought up about

161
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,324
we're still trying to figure
out what vitamins are what

162
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:19,827
and what's good for us.

163
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:24,585
Because I feel like it's more
better to spend even just

164
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:29,235
a few more cents, if organic
food isn't that expensive,

165
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:30,867
and go to certain places.

166
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:35,027
A few more cents on the local,
home grown organic food,

167
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:38,999
because I used to buy meat from the...

168
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:44,434
What's it called?

169
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:45,490
The meat section.

170
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,449
- [Female student] The deli?

171
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,378
- Deli, yeah, there you go.

172
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:48,498
And I used to buy meat there,

173
00:07:48,498 --> 00:07:49,959
and I thought it was all
fine, you know, whatever,

174
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,548
until I went to the doctor one day

175
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:52,764
because I was getting really injured,

176
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,220
and she was like, "You're
missing all these vitamins,"

177
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,673
and she gave me all
these vitamins to take.

178
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:01,137
And I didn't know that that
was missing inside my food,

179
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:04,199
and then I go to the organic
section of the supermarket

180
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,865
and it's not even, like,
vitamins that were missing in

181
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:09,446
the meat, it's vitamins that
were missing in the drinks

182
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:11,355
that can be found in organic food.

183
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,531
For example, like the naked juice

184
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:16,144
has these vitamins
already included in there,

185
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,832
just because it's, like,
naturally grown and organic.

186
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:23,508
So, I was willing to spend the
extra dollar for my health.

187
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,253
So, I feel like if people realize

188
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:27,034
how important it is for your health,

189
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,540
that scare will wake them up

190
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,923
and they'll be able to spend the dollar.

191
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:36,772
- Okay, well, I agree.

192
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:40,772
I think that it's worth the
extra cost for organic,

193
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:43,001
because, like, in the book it said

194
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,465
when we buy organic food,

195
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:48,995
we're voting with our
forks, and we're voting

196
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,787
for the type of food we want.

197
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:55,438
And if we go organic, then
the producers will think

198
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:59,181
that most of us want
organic, so they'll start

199
00:08:59,181 --> 00:09:02,466
growing more and selling
more organic food,

200
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:07,068
so that it might become
cheaper in the long run.

201
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,774
- I personally don't really care.

202
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:14,818
(students laugh)

203
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:17,058
Like, if it's cheaper, that's cool,

204
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:19,617
because if it has pesticides on it

205
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:21,420
you can just wash it off.

206
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,974
And animal's rights are nice,

207
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,901
but they're going to be killed anyway.

208
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:32,869
It's like, they're all going to die anyway.

209
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:39,514
They're going to die, so...

210
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,098
Michael.

211
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,888
- I like it.

212
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,210
(students laugh)

213
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,015
And yeah, I mean, even
though organic's good,

214
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:51,807
we still have a lot of cheap food

215
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:54,954
that feeds a lot more people
that have lower income.

216
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:57,407
So, we might not be, like,
the healthiest nation,

217
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,799
but at least we give
an opportunity to feed

218
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,401
every single person in the United States.

219
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:05,054
So, I kind of like that.

220
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,956
They don't have to worry about
paying high prices for food,

221
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,641
even though it's bad for my health.

222
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,955
And even if it is bad,
I could just exercise.

223
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,789
(students laugh)

224
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:15,955
So, I think it's a
personal responsibility to

225
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,544
watch what you eat.

226
00:10:17,544 --> 00:10:19,362
So, we should be open to that.

227
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:22,013
- Even with the
industrialized food system,

228
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:24,392
we're still not feeding everyone.

229
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,930
If you go to like, the
Appalachians and stuff like that,

230
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,706
you still have kids that
are starving every day

231
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:34,247
because their parents
don't make enough money

232
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:36,029
to buy even the cheap food.

233
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,282
So, I think that it's not
that we need to focus less

234
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,330
on the cost of everything,

235
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,359
and just figure out a
better way to produce food

236
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,620
and grow it, and to make sure that

237
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,124
it gets where it needs to go.

238
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:51,142
I think we need to worry
about cost later on,

239
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:55,185
and try and focus on a way
to do that in the short term,

240
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:57,019
so that in the long term we can feed

241
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,794
as many people as we need to.

242
00:10:59,312 --> 00:11:00,543
Lisa.

243
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,504
- I see how you brought
up the Appalchians,

244
00:11:03,504 --> 00:11:07,045
but my question to you is is
it more important to worry

245
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,053
about issues here, where it effects us,

246
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,410
or would you find it more important

247
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,319
to focus, like, worldwide?

248
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,976
Like, you could focus on problems that

249
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,375
people have outside, but, like,

250
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:23,055
wouldn't you (mumbles)
focus on start here,

251
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:25,006
make sure that we have what we need first,

252
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:27,998
and then branch out?

253
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,054
- I think that with that, like,

254
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:34,211
with a lot of people
who get stuff locally...

255
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:36,078
So, if you're saying locally like,

256
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,358
are you talking, like, Chicago?

257
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,141
- Don't you think it's better
to start locally and then...

258
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,149
Like we get better locally,

259
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,336
and then we get better statewide,

260
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,597
and then we'll go on until everybody has

261
00:11:47,597 --> 00:11:50,232
enough money to do this, or their food,

262
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:52,028
everyone can buy their food.

263
00:11:52,493 --> 00:11:55,778
- I think so, but you also
have to take into consideration

264
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:59,212
that even if we do something in Illinois,

265
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:01,089
that doesn't guarantee
that other states are

266
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,019
going to adopt the same policies.

267
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,006
And I think if we focus
on doing something for

268
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:09,004
United States, and worry less
about the other countries,

269
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,753
even though, politically,

270
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:12,545
it might not be the right thing to do,

271
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:15,318
worry less about the other
countries at this time.

272
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,877
But I think we need to take
a step back and focus on

273
00:12:17,877 --> 00:12:21,856
just fixing as much as we can on a whole,

274
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:23,808
and then going down
into the smaller levels

275
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,877
and seeing, okay, how
can we make this better

276
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:27,772
on a local level?

277
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:28,746
Chris?

278
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:34,350
- I think that we can't really

279
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,170
make it perfect,

280
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,037
like the way Polyface Farms is,

281
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:41,871
because of how the cities are laid out.

282
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:46,271
Because the cities are
too big to have farms

283
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:49,828
in reasonable reach of the people there.

284
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,929
So, I think what we have to do

285
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:56,553
is have this industrial organic,

286
00:12:56,553 --> 00:12:59,881
which still is, I mean,
a lot more worth it,

287
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,539
because it keeps the
biodiversity in the soil,

288
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:07,251
and I read in the book
they said something like

289
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:10,387
that the size of the state of New Jersey

290
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,310
was, like, a dead zone at the
end of the Mississippi River

291
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,101
and the Gulf from all the

292
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,885
pesticides and fertilizers that flow down.

293
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:22,241
And that's (mumbles) problem

294
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,273
that we should focus on.

295
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,892
- Well, I agree with Teresa that

296
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:38,220
we should start only in the US,

297
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,419
because we can't just
make a generalization

298
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:43,670
that other countries are using corn

299
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,209
and are eating unhealthy just as we are.

300
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:49,098
We only know that the
US is eating unhealthy

301
00:13:49,098 --> 00:13:51,574
because, according to Omnivore's Dilemma,

302
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:53,600
King Corn, and Food Incorporated,

303
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,789
the problems are only
occurring in the United States.

304
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:00,832
So, if we want to solve this problem,

305
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,805
we should start from the origins,

306
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:05,311
because we started using corn massively,

307
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,626
creating problems, and stuff,

308
00:14:07,626 --> 00:14:09,471
not because of other countries.

309
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:11,710
Well, maybe because we imported

310
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,716
corn from Mexico and they dominated out

311
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:16,095
other corn types, so
we started using corn.

312
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:20,180
But we should start focusing on more of

313
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,878
what's the problem over here,
instead of other countries,

314
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:25,577
because we have to solve
our own problems first

315
00:14:25,577 --> 00:14:28,579
before we become worried
about other problems, maybe.

316
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,744
Yeah.

317
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,782
- I was going to say that it is worth it

318
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,021
to spend the money in organic,

319
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:39,218
because even if it's just
a little bit of farms

320
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:42,642
here and there, people seem to be willing

321
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:44,562
to travel the extra mile just to get that

322
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,408
healthy piece of food.

323
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,519
Like in Polyface Farms, people came

324
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,962
from hundreds of miles, I think,

325
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:54,439
or 100 miles, just to get
their healthy chickens

326
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,657
or the healthy food.

327
00:14:56,657 --> 00:14:59,313
And with Jerry, I wanted to say that...

328
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:01,897
Well, nevermind.

329
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,446
(mumbles)

330
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,416
- Okay then.

331
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,389
So, I remember Gabby said

332
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,669
how we should be focusing on

333
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:11,685
making as much food as possible

334
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,537
for everyone in America,

335
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,517
and that's the issue we
should be working on.

336
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,692
But that's really what
the food industry does,

337
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,252
like making the most food possible.

338
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,470
They pretty much put
everything else aside,

339
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,412
besides mass production.

340
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:26,916
They don't really care
about animal rights,

341
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,636
or worker safety, or anything like that.

342
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:31,214
They just put as much work as they can

343
00:15:31,214 --> 00:15:32,878
into making more food,

344
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:35,118
and like Gabby said, people in America

345
00:15:35,118 --> 00:15:37,369
still can't afford this food that's

346
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,854
cheaper than it's ever been in the past.

347
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:43,246
So, it just shows that,
really, we can not go back to

348
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,379
just normal farms, because

349
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,506
there's no way just
natural farms like Polyface

350
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:53,511
could ever sustain a
population as big as America.

351
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,209
Like, we kind of dug ourselves into a hole.

352
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,428
Yeah.

353
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,834
- Okay, so what do you
think we should do then?

354
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,764
If we've dug ourselves--

355
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,023
(students laugh)

356
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:05,612
If we've dug ourselves into this hole,

357
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:08,663
even though if we're going to be producing

358
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,775
less food that's better quality,

359
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:12,460
I agree that is better,

360
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,817
because then you're
taking the animal rights

361
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,110
into consideration, the
workers' rights and everything.

362
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,553
But then either we have
to figure out a way

363
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,504
to change how people eat,

364
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,043
and so people are eating
a bigger variety of food,

365
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:26,720
or somehow figure out a different way

366
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,224
to be able to feed everyone.

367
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,749
Because, at the end of the day,

368
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:32,917
either we're going to have
a lot of people who die

369
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,106
because we change this,
and we change it too fast,

370
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:38,325
and we're not ready to adapt to it,

371
00:16:38,325 --> 00:16:40,917
or we can do it slowly and
try and figure out ways

372
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,268
so that everyone somehow survives.

373
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:45,198
Eli.

374
00:16:46,058 --> 00:16:49,065
- Okay, well, I think
that we should really

375
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:51,039
just follow the model of, like, France,

376
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,801
or some other country
in Europe or something.

377
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:56,948
Because they have a way better...

378
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,499
People in France are so much healthier

379
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:00,960
than people in America,

380
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,710
and they don't eat nearly as much food.

381
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,339
They still aren't starving,
most people in France

382
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,988
aren't starving or anything.

383
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,594
So, there are countries,

384
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:12,867
it's just not left them.

385
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:16,350
- Okay, I don't know if this makes sense,

386
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,198
but if they have, like 20,000 chickens

387
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:22,387
in one pen, do they
have to feed them corn?

388
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:24,456
Like, what's wrong with mass production,

389
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:26,302
but making it a little healthier?

390
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:28,456
Why can't they just
give them something else

391
00:17:28,456 --> 00:17:31,997
that's maybe not all
corn, maybe half corn,

392
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:34,610
or half corn to little corn?

393
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,397
And then, metaphorically speaking,

394
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,957
this totally reminds me of Hitler,

395
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:43,005
and, like, how he took over all the people

396
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:45,244
and made them work to
death and everything,

397
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,634
and that's like what they're
doing with the animals.

398
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,329
They're just working them to death,

399
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,334
and they have no rights
or happiness whatsoever.

400
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:55,643
Deja?

401
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:58,182
- I think the answer to your question is

402
00:17:58,182 --> 00:18:00,539
that most people just want money,

403
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,040
so they'll buy whatever's cheapest

404
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,891
and pay low wages to people

405
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:07,205
just so they can make a lot of money.

406
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,890
I think that's the answer
to your question about

407
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,634
why don't they just choose
another food instead of corn.

408
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,479
I think it's because of money.

409
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:18,383
- But also consider, what about...

410
00:18:19,453 --> 00:18:22,371
What about the industrial organic?

411
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:24,728
Doesn't that address this whole problem

412
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,787
of how the chickens are fed?

413
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,813
Even though they're raised in coops?

414
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:30,520
- [Male student] They're still fed corn.

415
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,520
(female student mumbles)

416
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,480
- Molly.

417
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,419
- Okay, so I think that
it's a really good idea

418
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,531
that Matthew brought up a while ago,

419
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:46,988
that the industrial issue,

420
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:51,702
it can't really be solved
by using beyond organic.

421
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:53,505
I think we've moved on from that.

422
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,969
We can't really go back to beyond organic,

423
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,697
because we wouldn't be
able to feed enough people.

424
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:59,136
And then just to Adam's point,

425
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:01,067
I don't think that we're
not producing enough food.

426
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,464
I think the problem

427
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:04,373
is that the people don't have
enough money for the food.

428
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:07,179
So, I think that producing more
food wouldn't really help.

429
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:12,118
- [Female student] I was going to say,

430
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,133
everyone keeps talking
about mass production

431
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,022
and that view would feed everybody.

432
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:20,246
But if you think, we actually
waste a lot of food too.

433
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,219
That's actually important.

434
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,267
I think we saw a picture or something,

435
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,763
all of it gets thrown out every day,

436
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:28,619
or they have ads on it on TV.

437
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:30,912
If we're so worried
about feeding everyone,

438
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:32,437
why don't we eat better ourselves,

439
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,385
and stop buying so much
food we don't actually eat?

440
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:42,570
- Well, either, whether you
guys want to change it locally

441
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,222
to outside or outside to inside,

442
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:45,865
I like the idea that you guys

443
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,689
think about spreading the idea.

444
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,047
Whether it's taking France's ideas

445
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:51,913
and taking it onto ourselves,

446
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,588
or just ourselves spreading it out.

447
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:56,606
Because (mumbles) so obnoxious,

448
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,942
they would go out to
McDonald's, my family,

449
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:00,574
and be like, "Do you know what that eats?"

450
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,768
And then just start talking.

451
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,008
We're like, "Shut up,
don't tell me what it eats.

452
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:05,267
"I'm going to eat it."

453
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:06,888
And now my mom asks me, she's like,

454
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,827
"Is this good?"

455
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:08,840
And then I read it, I'm like, "Yeah,

456
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,875
"it has this and this and this."

457
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,357
And now she turns to me

458
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:13,618
and, like, asks me should
we buy this, should we not?

459
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:16,498
So, I think I have changed
a little bit at least,

460
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:17,644
having been
