1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:03,311
- [Teacher] What are you noticing about it

2
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:04,735
compared to these two?

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,538
- This one's light brown.

4
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:07,774
These are all dark.

5
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,679
So I think this one's
not getting enough water.

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,886
So we should water it.

7
00:00:12,886 --> 00:00:13,750
- What's happening

8
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,466
because it's not getting enough water?

9
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:18,001
- It's like drying out.

10
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,618
- What's happening to the seed?

11
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:22,689
- The seed is dying.

12
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,553
It can't grow.

13
00:00:24,553 --> 00:00:26,306
- And the seed's gonna die.

14
00:00:26,306 --> 00:00:27,149
- Yeah.

15
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,814
- Because what's the first
stage of a life cycle?

16
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,135
- And you have water in it.

17
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:33,628
- It's a seed.

18
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:34,497
- Yeah.

19
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:35,777
- And then it sprouts.

20
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:38,446
- But on this one all stems are dying.

21
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:40,768
- Oh wow, that looks really dry.

22
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:41,829
- So which one are you measuring?

23
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:42,936
- We're measuring water.

24
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:45,667
- Okay, let's measure it.

25
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,448
- Let me measure it.

26
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:51,615
- Okay, let's measure it and
let's record how tall it is.

27
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,772
- I don't know how you use it.

28
00:00:56,772 --> 00:01:00,070
(cross talk)

29
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,000
- Yeah, almost four inches.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,584
- Centimeters.

31
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:05,417
Here, I'll measure it.

32
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:11,400
- Seven and a half centimeters.

33
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:14,943
- Can you hold it, yeah?

34
00:01:14,943 --> 00:01:16,013
- Maybe if you hold it.

35
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:17,202
- Oh no, it came out.
- It's okay.

36
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,098
- It's alright we'll just--

37
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:20,926
- Ours came out, and then it's still good.

38
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,509
- Just hold him up.

39
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,689
- It's six centimeters.

40
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,522
- Okay, let's check.

41
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:28,206
- Wow, it's growing two times enough.

42
00:01:28,206 --> 00:01:29,806
- Keep it there and let's see.

43
00:01:29,806 --> 00:01:31,897
Let's see if the rest
of your group agrees.

44
00:01:31,897 --> 00:01:32,770
- Yeah, I agree.

45
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,951
- That leaf is up to six centimeters.

46
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:38,371
- Okay, so what in, in a
week, how much has it grown?

47
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,392
- It's grown three.

48
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,486
- Three centimeters.

49
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:42,721
- Three centimeters, yeah.

50
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,455
- Three centimeters.

51
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:46,788
- Okay, write and record it.

52
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:50,007
So that's parsley.

53
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,325
Write, write.

54
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:54,158
(background talk)

55
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,852
Why do you think parsley
is doing so much better

56
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:03,285
than roma tomato?

57
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:06,060
- Because the tomato is like,

58
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,025
a tomato has one thing, and
parsley has the same thing

59
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:13,033
and they come out.

60
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,277
- What do you mean the same?

61
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:18,602
- I think maybe because parsley.

62
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:22,519
- Because parsley has, a rose,

63
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,720
it's easier because,

64
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:31,625
because a tomato has more time to grow,

65
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,215
because it like,

66
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:36,548
it's the kind of vegetable that has...

67
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,591
- Which is actually even drier.

68
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,547
- Can you guys help her out?

69
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,297
Can you help her out?

70
00:02:46,929 --> 00:02:50,612
- I think, well I think
that's growing better

71
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:52,441
than the roma tomatoes.

72
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,853
- Is tomato a fruit?

73
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,450
- Day one.

74
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,105
- Like it's growing a fruit,
that's what the tomato is.

75
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:00,260
Like a vegetable, it's
the fruit of the plant.

76
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,093
- Yeah.

77
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:01,926
- That we eat.

78
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:06,093
- But I think that, what I
think it's important is that

79
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,405
we grow this.

80
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:09,357
- Yes.

81
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:11,733
- Yes, they'll
grow at different times.

82
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,890
Once they grow, it'll grow fast.

83
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,891
- Yeah, we started this one,

84
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:17,982
planting faster, right?

85
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:20,982
We started this one two weeks later.

86
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:26,526
Do you think we need to
water the tomato more though?

87
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:27,659
- Yeah.

88
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,760
- When you look
at the parsley and feel,

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,773
feel how wet that one is.

90
00:03:31,773 --> 00:03:33,789
And it's doing so well.

91
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:34,799
- I know.

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,231
- Compared to the tomato,
maybe we need to water more?

93
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,064
- Yes.

94
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:39,348
- Is this parse?

95
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,028
It's the parts?

96
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,487
- [Voiceover] No it's the gender.

97
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,061
- [Voiceover] I think they
need to get more sun and water.

98
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:46,870
- Okay, so Abby's
measuring her tomato.

99
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,898
- [Abby] I did it.

100
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,096
- [Teacher] What do you guys want to do?

101
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:50,976
Do you want to do the top of the leaf

102
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,863
or should we do the top of the stem?

103
00:03:52,863 --> 00:03:55,113
- Top of the leaf.

104
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:56,262
- [Voiceover] Top of the leaf.

105
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:57,497
The leaf is part of the plant.

106
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:58,576
- [Teacher] Okay, so
you're putting it down,

107
00:03:58,576 --> 00:03:59,874
all the way down?

108
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,291
- Down and round.

109
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:07,969
- It's four.

110
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:08,802
- Okay.

111
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:09,649
- It's four.

112
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,482
- Alright.

113
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:11,315
- Four.

114
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:13,081
- So every single time when you measure

115
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:17,876
this plant, are you gonna
measure the top of the leaf

116
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:19,651
not the top of the stem? Is that what you're going to do?

117
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:20,484
- Yeah.

118
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,537
- It started four sessions ago.

119
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,618
It started four sessions ago.

120
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:39,451
(background talk)

121
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,362
- This one started two weeks before.

122
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:47,305
This one.

123
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,412
Let's look at the measurements,

124
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:53,405
and how much for growing,
can you compare these two?

125
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:54,791
What are some things that you notice?

126
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,730
- I notice that--

127
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,227
- It's grown three
and a quarter centimeters.

128
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:02,629
Everything else, won't be able to have.

129
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:06,546
(mumbles) two more centimeters.

130
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,208
- G plant.

131
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,606
- Can you tell me which
one's growing quicker?

132
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,606
- This one are pregnant.

133
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:17,933
- Are you sure about that?

134
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:18,766
- Yes.

135
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,759
Actually, maybe because...

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,506
- This started out, and
this one not so here before.

137
00:05:24,506 --> 00:05:27,472
- Okay, and we started this one when?

138
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:30,472
- We started this on, I mean two weeks ago.

139
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:33,324
- Two weeks after this one.

140
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:34,986
- Yeah.

141
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,158
- So, even though this
one was started later,

142
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,564
what's happened?

143
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:40,243
It's growing.

144
00:05:40,243 --> 00:05:41,359
- More.

145
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,924
- Faster, taller, yup.

146
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:44,757
Okay.

147
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:50,955
Why do you think, and you
guys even noticed that it was dry,

148
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:53,323
and it's still growing faster.

149
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:54,156
- Yeah.

150
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,795
- So, should we keep water,
should we water it more

151
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:00,813
and see what happens?

152
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:01,646
- Yeah.

153
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:02,479
- What do you want to do?

154
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,908
- I want to, want to, since
there's no more seeds in there,

155
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:08,315
because we took two of them
out and then the other one died.

156
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:10,855
I think we should grow more seeds in there

157
00:06:10,855 --> 00:06:12,991
and then water it and see what happens.

158
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,961
- Okay, go ahead, you can plant it.

159
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,889
And there are sometimes seeds,

160
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:20,779
they just won't germinate.

161
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,743
They're sometimes just like a bad seed

162
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:24,380
and they just won't, they won't grow.

163
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,348
Maybe that's what
happened to this one too.

164
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:28,592
- Can I go through and bob it?

165
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:31,718
- But in the inside of
it, it looks very dark.

166
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:33,825
But the outside of it does.

167
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:35,917
- So maybe it's not as dry as we thought.

168
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,152
- Yeah.

169
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:41,190
- Now we have to
take measurements again.

170
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,615
- We'll just see if that helps.

171
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,032
- There's only this one left.

172
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:48,012
- Let's look at this seed.

173
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:49,914
What do you notice about it?

174
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:52,380
- I know for, we came from last time

175
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,665
when we grow the parsley, this seed is way bigger

176
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,684
than that parsley seed.

177
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,757
- [Voiceover] These are not dead.

178
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:01,789
- [Teacher] How about
compared to the sunflower seed

179
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:02,840
or a pumpkin seed?

180
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,306
- [Voiceover] It's really small.

181
00:07:04,306 --> 00:07:07,723
And things can use the lines smaller maybe,

182
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,379
because they're smaller things,

183
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,046
or like a sunflower.

184
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:17,628
- Oh, so you think maybe the seed,

185
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:19,566
the size of the seed tells you how big

186
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,685
the plant is going to be?

187
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:21,518
- Yeah.

188
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,351
- Okay.

189
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:26,040
- On that, some of the
tomatoes are as big as that,

190
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,131
or bigger than that.

191
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,717
Sometimes the seeds are,

192
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,050
how they start out are smaller,

193
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:39,197
but sometimes the shape of it,

194
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,864
sometimes determines

195
00:07:41,923 --> 00:07:45,423
the shape of it sometimes, but others not.

196
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,913
- You mean the seed tells
you the shape of the plant?

197
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:50,680
- Sometimes, yeah.

198
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,030
- It could.

199
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,254
- What about a flower or something?

200
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,116
- Flowers seeds are different.

201
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,374
- They all look different.

202
00:07:58,374 --> 00:07:59,213
- No.

203
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,106
- So is that always the case?

204
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:01,939
- No.

205
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:06,930
- But some of your classmates have plants

206
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,409
that are gonna grow bigger.

207
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,275
And so maybe we should
ask them about theirs

208
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:14,108
and find out if their
plant is growing faster,

209
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:19,696
or slower compared to these
two plants, than yours.

210
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:23,863
And maybe we can see if the
seed size makes a difference.

211
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,624
Alright, you guys can get online.

212
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,450
Yeah, you can go ahead and water it.

213
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,666
- One in here, and one in here.

214
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,746
- And then I want you
to go to that website

215
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,260
and start your graphs when you'e done.

216
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,413
You might want to water it a lot more.

217
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,034
- Let me try.

218
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:41,020
- And then over it.

219
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,925
- [Voiceover] We finished
watering our plants.

220
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:47,041
- [Voiceover] Do we each get a computer?

221
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:47,999
- We need help.

222
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,872
When we type into trying capitals in it,

223
00:08:50,872 --> 00:08:51,936
it deleted our numbers.

224
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:52,881
So.

225
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:53,714
- Okay.

226
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:54,818
- We didn't know what was wrong.

227
00:08:54,818 --> 00:08:57,686
- Well you have your title, Plant Type.

228
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,595
Let's be more specific because

229
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:02,517
you're not doing all the plants.

230
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:04,919
What plant are you graphing right now?

231
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,549
- Swiss chard.

232
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,505
- And?

233
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,874
- Kale.

234
00:09:08,874 --> 00:09:10,215
- Did you measure them already?

235
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,048
- Yeah.

236
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:14,488
And then we drag the numbers but
then they don't...

237
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:17,029
- I think it's because of all that room.

238
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,209
- James, where is your measurement
for swiss chard for today?

239
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:22,292
- Right here.

240
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,310
- You want to record that.
- Swiss chard.

241
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,127
(clicking computer keys)

242
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:39,877
- And kale was...
- What was kale again?

243
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:40,710
- Seven.

244
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,493
- This height look correct?

245
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:46,564
- No.

246
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:47,846
- What are we missing?

247
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,429
Do you guys notice?

248
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:54,204
- The up need.

249
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,810
- Oh, I notice.

250
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,126
- There you go, alright.

251
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:07,522
Okay, so what's going to be
your label for your bar graph?

252
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:10,689
That's the one going along the bottom.

253
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:13,268
- The bottom, the plant height?

254
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,331
How high the plant reading?

255
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:18,686
- Are you gonna, what
are you gonna graph then

256
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,853
for your bars?

257
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:22,779
- Hmm.

258
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:23,612
- What do we always look at when

259
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:24,822
we're thinking about our graphs?

260
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:27,018
We always go back to
our data table, right?

261
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:30,429
- What are we gonna do instead
of getting ahead or not?

262
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,471
- Seven centimeters for kale.

263
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,606
- You're gonna have to put kale right there.

264
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:35,439
- I know.

265
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:37,049
It's just, that was the big plan.

266
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:40,049
I think I'm on the tail now because...

267
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:44,353
- Okay you have, what's this one?

268
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,520
- That was eggplant.

269
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,353
- Okay.

270
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,871
And this is swiss chard?
- Yeah.

271
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:50,066
Well here's that, why
don't you measure that?

272
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,899
You haven't measured it yet.

273
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,517
- About five centimeters.

274
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:00,530
- Did you agree Walt?

275
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,447
- Yeah, about five centimeters.

276
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,393
- Is that what you got too?

277
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:07,232
- Yeah.

278
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,732
(lots of background talk)

279
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:21,725
- So why are we gonna have a
graph for just swiss chard,

280
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:24,368
and just kale?

281
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,329
Or are we gonna have a graph for both

282
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:28,162
together?

283
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:30,912
What would be easier?
- Both together I think.

284
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:32,452
- Should we put it together?

285
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:33,929
How would we do that?

286
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,113
How would you merge that?

287
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,744
- I think like both
should have their own bar,

288
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:40,128
like in the same graph.

289
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:40,961
- I think so too.

290
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:44,946
So which plant do you want to graph today?

291
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,696
Are you gonna do swiss chard or kale?

292
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:49,891
- [Voiceover] They really needed help.

293
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,399
- [Voiceover] Let's do kale.

294
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,446
- Let's look at kale.

295
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,310
- [Teacher] Okay.

296
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,073
- [Voiceover] What's kale?

297
00:11:58,073 --> 00:11:59,573
- Here's the kale.

298
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,127
- [Voiceover] Which one are we measuring?

299
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:07,294
- James, what did you get
for the height for kale?

300
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,498
- Seven centimeters.

301
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,786
- Okay look, see if Andrew gets seven.

302
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,578
- Yeah, about seven.

303
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:14,411
- Okay.

304
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,651
And what was the height
of it last week, James?

305
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,984
So Andrew knows.

306
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:27,363
- It was six centimeters.

307
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,696
- Okay, it was six centimeters.

308
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:32,081
So just put six centimeters here.

309
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,164
There you go.

310
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,847
Okay, so lets fix this, let's
just make it kale height.

311
00:12:49,038 --> 00:12:49,871
Or grow.

312
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:56,542
And then, what's this, what are
you gonna put at the bottom?

313
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,934
Look at your table.

314
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:01,133
- [Voiceover] The height of kale.

315
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,133
- Is that gonna go along the bottom?

316
00:13:06,814 --> 00:13:09,959
- How tall it was, like
in day one and day two.

317
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,792
- Let's look.

318
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,014
What were the labels for our table?

319
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:14,278
- Date and measurement.

320
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:15,492
- Okay, so that's what we're going with.

321
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:16,589
- So the measurement will be on the bottom

322
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,922
and the date is on the side.

323
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:21,267
- Do you guys agree?

324
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,205
James?

325
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:24,122
You think that's right?

326
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,260
Okay, we'll try it.

327
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:29,117
Go date

328
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:33,251
and then go ahead and type measurement.

329
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:36,411
Should we have a unit on it

330
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:37,761
since we're talking about measurement?

331
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:38,594
- Mhmm.

332
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:54,419
(lots of background talk)

333
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:56,574
- Okay.

334
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,353
So the whole point of--

335
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:03,353
- And what's in row one?

336
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:06,080
- One, four, 13?

337
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:09,352
- Okay, write that.

338
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:12,019
You're gonna put the date there?

339
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:22,441
Will, would you like a turn?

340
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,279
- Mhm.

341
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,918
- Instead of doing commas,

342
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:25,929
if you're gonna write it like that,

343
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,512
you're gonna put a dash in between.

344
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:28,564
I'm gonna have Will,

345
00:14:28,564 --> 00:14:30,231
Will type this time.

346
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,721
We'll take turns.

347
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,388
So type in the date.

348
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:45,377
(mumbling)

349
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:50,122
Okay, and then what would go here under the?

350
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,579
What are you gonna graph?

351
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,636
Like what's gonna be the bar graph part?

352
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:57,136
- Six centimeters?

353
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:00,191
No, no, the height was the, another beam.

354
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,691
