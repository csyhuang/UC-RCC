1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,820
- Work of art in front of the class using
the smart board.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,550
- We have to--

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,380
- Continue working please.

4
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,570
- We have to finish the whole thing today?

5
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,170
- You should have enough time if y'all
aren't drawing on the artwork that much.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,670
But y'all been working hard and a little
bit of playing, but working pretty well.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,500
After you get finished with the analysis,
go ahead and flip over and start on your

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,630
interpretation. What you think is going on
or what the artist is trying to portray in

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:28,830
the work of art. All right, so y'all are
on interpretation?

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,240
- Yeah.

11
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,680
- What do y'all think of the work of art?
Kaitlin, what do you think of the work of

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,570
art?

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,470
- Well, it makes us feel like calm.

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:35,990
- It made me feel calm.

15
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,310
- It made y'all feel calm?

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,310
- No, it made me feel calm.

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:39,580
- It made me feel calm.

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,560
- Okay. Now have any of y'all been out
west?

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,200
- Huh?

20
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,870
- Out west like Colorado, Wyoming, places
like that?

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,560
- Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,910
- Well, sometimes in the mountains, they
have places where the snow has melted and

23
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,150
there are actually small lakes or ponds up
inside the mountains. So you could

24
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,570
actually either be looking at a lake where
you could drive up to or something that's

25
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,690
hidden in the mountains. So if you're
calm, that's a pretty good idea. All

26
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,120
right, guys, what are y'all working on
now.

27
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,520
- We're on judging the building. I keep
working on one.

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,990
- Okay. Can you tell me what you have
about interpretation?

29
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:19,300
- I think of this art as a rainy day. The
sky is a dull gray.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,840
- I like the bright colors on the doors.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,180
- It's like a mixture of happiness and
boredom. Since it looks like it's raining,

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,480
the dark clouds at the top of the painting
when it goes from white to dark.

33
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,480
- Like from light and it's going to dark,
that's when you can tell it's about to

34
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:35,690
rain.

35
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,490
- Okay, gotcha, gotcha. Sounds good.

36
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,890
- That, sir, is my interpretation.

37
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,670
- Okay, and with judgment, what are y'all
think about the work of art right now?

38
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,940
- My judgment of the art is that it's
kind of a boring day. It's slightly dull

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,590
but you don't know what's about to happen.

40
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,850
- Sounds good so far. Keep working. Y'all
doing all right over here?

41
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,710
- Yeah, we're doing...

42
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,300
- I wrote my opinion. Now he's gonna write
his opinion.

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,730
- Yeah.

44
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,380
- And then Brody will write his opinion?
Sounds great.

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,580
- All right. Y'all on interpretation. What
y'all had? Oh, y'all are each doing

46
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,230
interpretation?

47
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,540
- Yes, sir. We were going to do that for
judgment and interpretation.

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,540
- Sounds great. And what are y'all looking
at now for interpretation with the subway

49
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,200
painting?

50
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,210
- We're doing what it makes you feel.

51
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,980
- Okay, what do you have so far?

52
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,230
- Well, he wrote most of them.

53
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,890
- Okay, so he can read it?

54
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,950
- Okay, actually it makes me feel like
traveling...

55
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,480
- Okay.

56
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,490
- ...since they're on a train. And that's
pretty much it.

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,350
- All right. Who would like to tell me
what they are thinking of for

58
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,500
interpretation on valley flowers?

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:47,810
- I don't know. I mean, it's a good
painting but it's not really my favorite.

60
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,800
- Okay.

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,530
- It's not very exciting.

62
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,900
- So that would be for judgment? You don't
find it exciting? Okay, kind of boring.

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,410
What do you think of the work of art?

64
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:04,120
- I think it's a bit dull because there's
not really any colors or anything like

65
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:13,340
that, and it's got the same colors where
each... Right here is green, and right

66
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,300
here is orange, and blues back there.

67
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,120
- You know, if I was using my imagination,
I would think of maybe The Incredibles in

68
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,310
where the mole men came up at the end and
were taking over the Earth. So these could

69
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,000
be tunnel boring machines.
