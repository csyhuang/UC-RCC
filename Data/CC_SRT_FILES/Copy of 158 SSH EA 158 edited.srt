1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:01,769
- [Boy in gray] I think we need the policeman,

2
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:03,510
because he's the only one with a weapon.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,129
He's the only one with a weapon though.

4
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:07,778
- [Student in red] What if he goes crazy?

5
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:09,844
He's the only one with a gun.

6
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,027
- [Boy in gray] Exactly, that's a good thing, though.

7
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:14,395
- [Teacher] Wait a sec,
why is that a good thing?

8
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:15,928
- [Girl in floral] Are you saying he'd shoot us?

9
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,483
- [Boy in gray] I didn't say it's a good
thing if someone could shoot us.

10
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:18,456
- [Teacher] No, I didn't say that.

11
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:19,408
You said it's a good thing.

12
00:00:19,408 --> 00:00:20,522
Explain why you think it's a good thing.

13
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:23,876
- [Boy in gray] It's a good thing 
because we could stock the food, Drake.

14
00:00:23,876 --> 00:00:26,172
- [Teacher] OK, so he said two things.

15
00:00:26,172 --> 00:00:29,728
- [Student in floral] But he might 
shoot us because we might be starving

16
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,676
and he might start to shoot us.

17
00:00:31,676 --> 00:01:04,039
(Heavy Background Chatter)

18
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:06,249
- [Boy in orange] We could take him, 
he wouldn't shoot us.

19
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,448
- [Teacher] Where you at, Riley, it
looks like you're sweating.

20
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,120
- [Riley] I'm trying to
think between you two.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,238
- [Teacher] So you write down
what you said you'd do,

22
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:21,118
and you worry about everybody here.

23
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,369
Who do you think is the most important?

24
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,262
Eileen says the policeman, does everybody

25
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:29,400
agree with that or not?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,283
- [Girl in gray] Yeah.

27
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,211
- [Boy in orange] Why?

28
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:42,108
- [Teacher] (Listens to Eileen) Because 
if someone gets hurt--(Background Chatter)

29
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,935
He can respond to medical stuff?

30
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:45,109
yeah, they're First Responders.

31
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,270
It's a good idea.

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,129
Anybody else?

33
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,292
Can you write down reasons
why you should keep somebody?

34
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:57,166
Would anybody that you know
that works here already?

35
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:09,083
That's good, he's too old,
his life would be long.

36
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:18,434
So, the old sir will be able
to be productive to society.

37
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:20,757
Think about that.

38
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,360
Anything else about the male professor

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,774
that you maybe thought about?

40
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:30,721
- [Background Chatter]

41
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:34,400
[Teacher] --in support of communism. Do you
want that in your society or not?

42
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,750
- [Girl in gray] No.
- [Teacher] Why not?

43
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,150
- [Girl in gray] Because-- (Background Chatter)

44
00:02:40,150
- [Teacher] Okay, so freedoms 
are important to you.

45
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:43,588
- [Loudspeaker] Mr. Malls?

46
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:44,493
- [Teacher] Yes, ma'am?

47
00:02:44,493 --> 00:02:45,468
- [Loudspeaker] Send Kyle

48
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,560
to the office for a minute, please?

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,440
- [Teacher] He's in Miss Crane's room, right now.

50
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,756
- [Loudspeaker] What core are y'all in?

51
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:53,939
Because I told Mr. Wayward
where he was supposed to be,

52
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,077
and he said he was with you.

53
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:58,699
- [Teacher] Uh, he, we're actually in
2nd, he's with Miss Crane.

54
00:02:58,699 --> 00:03:00,631
- [Loudspeaker] All right, thank you.

55
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,509
- [Teacher] OK, you can resume.

56
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:06,413
Folks, we're about, I don't know,

57
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:09,078
15 minutes until the end.

58
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,961
- [Girl in gray] Hey, why should we keep
the male professor?

59
00:03:14,285 --> 00:03:16,369
- [Teacher] What's the issue you have?

60
00:03:16,369 --> 00:04:13,044
- (Heavy Background Chatter)

61
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,982
- [Teacher] OK, now this is just a question, guys,

62
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:21,158
If someone's not fit, does that mean they

63
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:23,513
have no potential to
be helpful to society?

64
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,999
- [Girlin yellow] Nah,
they could be really smart.

65
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,741
- [Teacher] OK, they could be really smart.

66
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,120
(Background Chatter)
- [Boy in gray] But she's nine--

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,700
- [Teacher] She's nine?

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:38,467
(Background Chatter) 

69
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,728
- [Teacher] She's nine, so, 
are you looking for right now

70
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:43,107
or are you looking for the long run?

71
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,997
- [Boy in crimson] We're talking 
about the long run.

72
00:04:44,997 --> 00:04:46,747
- [Teacher] The long run, so you got time.

73
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:51,066
So just consider all aspects, just because

74
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:53,643
maybe just because she has...

75
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:56,401
does she have anything to offer?

76
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,722
Let the group decide, it sounds like some

77
00:05:02,722 --> 00:05:04,974
people are really for and
some maybe are against it.

78
00:05,04,974 --> 00:05:12,834
(Background Chatter)

79
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,237
- [Student in crimson] If you
want a male farmer, say aye.

80
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:16,165
- [Male Students] Aye.

81
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,595
- [Boy in crimson] If you want the male
professional, say aye.

82
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,945
- [Only boy in crimson] Aye.
(Laughter)

83
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:25,331
- [Boy in crimson] If you want the female 
scientist, say aye.

84
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:27,821
- [Boy in Green, Girl in floral] Aye.

85
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,697
[Boy in crimson] If you want the 
male preacher, say aye.

86
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,800
[Girl in floral, Boy in gray] Aye.

87
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:37,086
- [Boy in crimson] Definitely female nurse.

88
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,549
- [Gir in yellow] We already have a nurse.

89
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:39,779
- [Boy in green] We already have a nurse!

90
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,499
- [Boy in crimson] Who cares?

91
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,567
- [Student in gray] I do.

92
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:48,977
- [Boy in crimson] In case he dies--
(Background Chatter)

93
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:52,132
- [Girl in yellow] But the female med
student's only in second year,

94
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:53,743
she hasn't even been to the hospital.

95
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,044
- [Boy in crimson] It might go for four years.

96
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:55,996
- [Girl in yellow] Exactly.

97
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:03,623
- [Boy in crimson] We got the scientist
and the nurse to help her.

98
00:06:03,623 --> 00:06:05,736
- [Boy in green] Plus she'd be off breeding.

99
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,152
- [Girl in yellow] Excuse me?

100
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:08,731
- [Boy in green] No offence.

101
00:06:08,731 --> 00:06:16,843
(Background Chatter)

102
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,535
- [Girl in floral] You know we only got
like thirty minutes.

103
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,436
- [Girl in yellow] We only have fifteen, so...

104
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,920
- [Teacher] Hey, we're about 5 or 10 more minutes,

105
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,987
and then I'm gonna stop you
in groups and you'll listen.

106
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,750
If you have not managed to
already make your decisions,

107
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,397
here's the key point,
here's the key point...

108
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:34,788
Still got a group talking,
you need to listen.

109
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,503
About five or ten more minutes, you need

110
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:40,013
to come down to your five, you need

111
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,638
to have the reasons
why you chose the five,

112
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,844
and we're gonna share
those, and reasons why

113
00:06:43,844 --> 00:06:46,142
you did not choose the
five you didn't choose.

114
00:06:46,142 --> 00:06:50,461
Keep in mind, Edna, keep
in mind that five are going

115
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:52,713
with you to start this new civilization

116
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,035
that's gonna hopefully
flourish, and I hope you're

117
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:57,506
all taking people with, uh,
that you know will make it.

118
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,326
But there's also, you gotta keep in mind,

119
00:06:59,326 --> 00:07:01,935
there's five people you're leaving behind,

120
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:03,938
that most likely is not gonna make it.

121
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,654
But you, you're
concentrating on who you need

122
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:10,276
to start this new productive society, OK?

123
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:13,040
OK, start closing up in the
next five or ten minutes,

124
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,176
about who you're choosing,
who you're not choosing.

125
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:18,589
Those radiation levels are
getting high, very high.

126
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,866
Over here especially.

127
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,347
- [Girl in floral] I know, really!

128
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,784
- [Boy in crimson] I kinda changed 
my mind about that.

129
00:07:29,054 --> 00:07:30,448
Because she's cute.

130
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:36,096
(Background Chatter)

131
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,439
- [Boy in crimson] You can't change times and down.

132
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,177
- [Girl in floral] I'm agreeing with that.

133
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,345
- [Boy in crimson] Say aye again, 
if you want-- (Background Chatter).

134
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,148
- [Most students] Aye.

135
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:44,722
- [Boy in crimson] Finally...

136
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,733
- [Boy in white] They wanna take 
cripple girl and I'm saying...

137
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,890
- [Student] He's still overruled.

138
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,096
- [Teacher] I posed this question 
just a minute ago.

139
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:05,690
So, this is, so we can look at mass...

140
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:08,644
So we can look at it two
ways, one you're looking at:

141
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:11,384
"She can't do anything,
she's gonna be hard to keep,

142
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:13,102
because someone will have to do it,

143
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,495
second way of looking at it, she...

144
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:18,558
And she doesn't have her doctor.

145
00:08:18,558 --> 00:08:20,201
Uh, is that true?

146
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,522
Once she had a doctor.

147
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:28,101
(Background Chatter)

148
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,279
- [Teacher] OK, and then what else?

149
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:41,522
(Background Chatter)

150
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,185
- [Teacher] Have you ever heard anything about...

151
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:45,317
- [Students] Yup.

152
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:53,379
(Background Chatter)

153
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,647
- [Teacher] So what if this person could
be maybe a scientist or a...

154
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,110
- [Boy in white] It didn't say that.

155
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,399
- [Teacher] But again you're not

157
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:17,487
- [Teacher] ...you can combine that.
OK, continue on.

158
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:21,271
You need to start choosing,
maybe 3 or 4 of your 5.

159
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,359
And why you're gonna take or
why you're not gonna take 'em.

- [Teacher] Five minutes!

166
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:49,791
I'm giving you five minutes!

167
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,393
Start making decisions.

(Background Chatter)

171
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:03,744
- [Teacher] Hey, I wanna share some of the tips

172
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:05,818
that some of you were talking about...

173
00:12:12,135 --> 00:12:14,434
And one person said, "well,
she has the potential to become

174
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,383
"any of these things here, she has

175
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,636
"the potential to be any of those,"

176
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:20,187
so it might something to consider.

(Background Chatter)

178
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,066
- [Student in white] We need
extra little kids, and she

179
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:43,403
won't help us with no extra little kids.

(Heavy Background Chatter)

181
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,644
- [Teacher] Somebody's
ready to go, just about,

182
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:40,363
so you need to make sure
you get your five choices.
