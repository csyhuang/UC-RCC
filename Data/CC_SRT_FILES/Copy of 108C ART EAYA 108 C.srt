00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,510
- Room 221. Students enter through a small
entryway. To their right are inspirational

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,980
displays and to their left is the entryway
to a traditional darkroom. This classroom

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,030
is shared by two teachers. Storage space
is limited. In this room, I teach three

4
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,710
sections of Photography, Advanced
Placement Studio Art, and Advanced

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,250
Placement Art History. As we open up into
the main part of the classroom, storage

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,010
areas are visible for each class'
photographic prints, a whiteboard is

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,620
visible with posted assignments, and
storage space where students retrieve

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,730
gloves and archival sheets for their
negatives. As I pan the room, you can see

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,850
heated dryers for prints and negatives
clearly labeled and accessible. Bulletin

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,790
boards are set up for project
instructions, visual examples, and

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,960
critique displays. Along the back of the
room is a dry-mount press and negative

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,590
developing chemicals with directions and
safety instructions posted throughout.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,360
Hanging from above are art history
displays created by students to aid in the

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,820
analysis of modern art movements. Cabinets
along the back of the room are clearly

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,230
labeled for easy retrieval of student
supplies. In the center of the room, the

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:15,560
printing press is stored for AP Studio Art
and set up to allow for safe and organized

17
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,890
used. Along the right-hand side of the
room, there is a drawing rack for students

18
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,830
to store work-in-progress and a light
table for the preparing and viewing of

19
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,230
photographic negatives. There is an
exhaust fan here for safety as well as a

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,980
paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid
accidents. The file cabinets are clearly

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,550
labeled for storage of student binders.
The large cabinet in the back of the room

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,470
is locked to safely store blades and other
potentially dangerous supplies. And at the

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,810
front of the room are storage bins for
students to retrieve missing work or work

24
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,810
that they might have been absent to
accept. And at the front of the room is

25
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,130
the computer for student and teacher use.
The projector screen lifts to reveal a

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,000
whiteboard for demonstrations and
instructions.
