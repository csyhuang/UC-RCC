1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:03,588
- So, good morning everyone.

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:04,489
- Good morning.

3
00:00:04,489 --> 00:00:06,187
- Good morning, today,

4
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:10,517
today, what we have is,

5
00:00:10,517 --> 00:00:14,367
we're going to have a debate
based on a couple things

6
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:16,001
that we have recently experienced.

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:20,180
One was research that we have
conducted about the chemistry

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,043
in scientific measurement
that's required in order

9
00:00:23,043 --> 00:00:26,011
to address a local issue that we have

10
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:29,987
with current regulations on water

11
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:32,621
and different lobbying
groups trying to change

12
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:35,454
those regulations for their own interests

13
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:37,459
and the groups they represent.

14
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:38,284
Okay.

15
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:43,211
And so we had a field trip
to Wastewater Treatment Plant

16
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,297
that allowed us to gain
information locally from scientists

17
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,994
to see what they're doing on their side

18
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:53,342
and what their opinions are
for either side of this debate

19
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:54,853
that is current in our city.

20
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,406
So, today I'm going to start
with our overarching question

21
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,479
which has really helped us in our research

22
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,544
and is now going to help us
to just devise our debates.

23
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,951
The overarching question
is up on the board

24
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,137
if you'd like to see it.

25
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:11,402
It says, how is scientific
measurement applied

26
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:13,224
in the creation

27
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:16,364
and the regulation of our local

28
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:17,665
environmental protection laws?

29
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:23,304
The environmental protection
side over here is proposing

30
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:26,688
new tighter regulations
that may have an impact

31
00:01:26,688 --> 00:01:29,741
on local businesses and rate payers,

32
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:33,250
or the people who pay for the
water utilities in our city.

33
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,914
So, I'll discuss the format of our debate.

34
00:01:35,914 --> 00:01:37,816
First, and that's, again, up on the board.

35
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:41,853
I will be finishing up
my introduction here,

36
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,621
and then we will have our lobbyist group

37
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:47,347
introduce themselves, who they represent,

38
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:50,306
and what their major goals
are for today's debate.

39
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:51,990
Okay.

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,213
Then we'll have a question
session where each group

41
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,569
will be able to probe into the reasoning

42
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,999
and the deeper understandings
to reveal your research

43
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:03,044
and each side of the story,

44
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:07,513
so that our City Council members
on our outer rows back here

45
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:10,349
will be able to reflect
upon what is being said.

46
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,759
So, city council members,
please be writing your notes.

47
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,054
When we get towards the end
of our debate time period

48
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,807
we will then have you folks make a debate.

49
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,728
It's going to be a vote on whether
or not we should agree with

50
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:27,705
the environmental side and
their decision to make

51
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:31,339
tighter regulations to
change current regulations

52
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:34,439
to allow lower levels into the water

53
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,386
of various different chemicals
that they will be discussing.

54
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,399
Okay.

55
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:44,365
At the end, each side will
have a one minute opportunity

56
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,786
to discuss a focus summary
statement in which they will

57
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:51,606
be able to summarize the
things that have been revealed

58
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,292
during today's debate.

59
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:54,493
(student coughs)

60
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,361
Good.

61
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,001
And then, as I said, at the
end we will have a vote.

62
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,932
City Council will vote on whether 
we should

63
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,767
make the restrictions tighter

64
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:06,120
on the water quality
standards in our city.

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,111
Are there any questions before we begin?

66
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,270
Okay, excellent.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,778
And so, I believe the,

68
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:18,288
this side had choice,

69
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:22,481
and so that means that
Corbin and his group,

70
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,249
for representing industry,

71
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:28,119
will be allowed to have that closing,

72
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,595
the last closing statement today.

73
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:31,362
And so we'll start with Tyler,

74
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:33,699
and then we'll try to go
back as fairly as possible,

75
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,342
back and forth.

76
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:37,902
So Tyler, if you'd like to
start with your opening comments

77
00:03:37,902 --> 00:03:41,451
about who you represent
and why you're here today.

78
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:45,310
- Our side of the argument
focuses on the environmental side

79
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,091
of the debate.

80
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,446
We believe that new water
regulations via legislation

81
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:50,982
that would more effectively
treat our drinking water

82
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:52,451
should be enacted.

83
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,181
The hazardous and deleterious chemicals

84
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,101
that are in our water,

85
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,922
particularly the excesses amounts
of nitrogen and phosporous

86
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,358
need to be controlled.

87
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:01,426
While it may negatively affect the selfish

88
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:03,864
interests of industry our
group would like to promote

89
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:06,298
the idea that doing nothing
and leaving our water

90
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:08,133
the way it is is not an option.

91
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:10,502
- [Teacher] Excellent.

92
00:04:10,502 --> 00:04:12,726
So Corbin, we're ready to hear your side

93
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:14,139
and who you represent.

94
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:17,315
- Our side focuses on the
business aspect of this debate.

95
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:19,977
We hope to persuade the
EPA and City Council

96
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:22,013
to agree that the waste
water that we put back

97
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:24,217
into creeks and streams meets the criteria

98
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:27,135
that is currently the
standard for cleanliness.

99
00:04:27,135 --> 00:04:30,062
And that it does not need improvement

100
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,991
except for a few chemicals
which does not improve

101
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:34,626
nitrogen and phosphorous

102
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:38,130
or that we do not need to
severely increase taxes

103
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,641
to pay for all of that.

104
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,150
- Outstanding.

105
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,653
And so, and then we will
begin, I guess, then,

106
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,741
with Tyler who can go ahead now,

107
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,030
and you can ask your first question.

108
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,246
And we'll be looking for
City Council members.

109
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,882
If you have any questions
that need to be clarified,

110
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:00,982
statements that you
would like to determine

111
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:02,721
what the reasoning is behind it,

112
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,092
please raise your hand,

113
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:05,793
and we'll make sure that
you get in immediately.

114
00:05:05,793 --> 00:05:07,025
Okay.

115
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,327
(teacher mumbles)

116
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:15,221
(students quietly talking)

117
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:24,301
(student laughing)
This is so funny.

118
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:32,509
- Okay, we figure that since
you say that our waters

119
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,699
don't really need to be,

120
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,789
it already meets the
standards of cleanliness,

121
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,558
but already in Colorado
we see fresh water species

122
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:43,732
that are becoming more
endangered, as the more chemicals,

123
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:47,032
because of the pollution
that is put into our waters

124
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:51,137
via industries like metals and dentistry.

125
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:58,909
21 out of 822 Native American fish species

126
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,424
have already become
endangered and extinct,

127
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,718
and we just would like to
know why you think that

128
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:09,487
that means that the water's clean enough.

129
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:13,745
- Okay, let me ask you this.

130
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:17,311
Do you have information on what
chemicals killed those fish?

131
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:23,735
- We have like the excess
amounts of nitrogen

132
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:25,603
and phosphorous that the EPA,

133
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,799
the standards that they're
trying to enforce now.

134
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,244
Like we saw on the video,

135
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:33,150
this creates the dead zones
because it removes oxygen

136
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,913
and the algae, algae
blooms start to produce.

137
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:38,286
So, it's mostly the nitrogen phosphate

138
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:43,058
that's preventing the
correct amount of oxygen

139
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:45,556
in the water for the fish
to breathe, technically.

140
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:46,591
- Okay.

141
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:49,673
I'd like to follow this
up with an article from,

142
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,462
I believe this is from the Gazette,

143
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:53,765
which is our Colorado Springs newspaper.

144
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:57,531
Since we're focusing
this debate on Colorado,

145
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,618
most likely our city,

146
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,576
we see that our city
does not have a problem

147
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:07,378
with algae blooms, says
the writer of this article.

148
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,514
So, therefore, when you
talk about algae blooms,

149
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:10,982
we don't have a problem with this.

150
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,818
So why should we be focusing on it?

151
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:14,719
- Because the water runs off the lakes.

152
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,746
That does cause a problem with us.

153
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:17,246
- Okay.

154
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,453
But even if we did have, I mean, a few...

155
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:19,265
(Damon mumbles)

156
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,847
Like I said again, our city does not

157
00:07:21,847 --> 00:07:23,963
have problems with these.

158
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,249
So we can't, therefore,

159
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:27,198
we can't focus our debate on these things

160
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,391
because it doesn't apply to us.

161
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,620
- Well, that one article

162
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,440
in a local newspaper from one writer

163
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,009
said that we don't have
problems with algae blooms.

164
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,780
But I've been in the
mountains around our area,

165
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,784
and I've seen many lakes,
ponds, just completely covered

166
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:47,151
with algae and scum.

167
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:50,707
And that so many of our local creeks,

168
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,657
Monument Valley Park,

169
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:57,497
and stuff, are just
littered with gross algae,

170
00:07:57,497 --> 00:08:00,665
and it creates these dead
zones that the fish swim into

171
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,934
and do not have any way to swim out of

172
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:04,639
because they have no nutrients in them

173
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,105
and just die on the spot.

174
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,840
- And the same thing happened
in the 1960s with Lake Erie,

175
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,676
and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay

176
00:08:10,676 --> 00:08:12,210
like we saw in the video.

177
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,144
And the same thing was
happening where they said

178
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,846
we don't need to fix it everything's fine,

179
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:19,317
and then just as nothing,
nobody did anything.

180
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,688
The lake soon was dead,

181
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:23,388
and it was like, there's no fish in there.

182
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:25,159
And the water's just completely ruined

183
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,825
with all kinds of chemical wastes,

184
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:28,326
so doing nothing isn't really...

185
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,162
- Okay, so I'm gonna interject.

186
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:32,665
What I'm hearing is that
there's a debate in here

187
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:35,301
about whether or not our
local water is an issue,

188
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:38,970
so I'd like to hear from
somebody in the City Council area

189
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,905
who will be making a vote today.

190
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:43,521
How about your thoughts about
the current water quality?

191
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:46,478
What you have heard from your
constituents in the areas

192
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:49,147
where you are located

193
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:52,984
and to determine whether
or not you feel currently,

194
00:08:52,984 --> 00:08:55,723
right now, what level of danger are we at?

195
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:58,189
Have you heard a lot about this?

196
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:01,652
Do you feel like we are
in need of serious change?

197
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:04,588
So, we can direct
the rest of the debate.

198
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:05,961
Okay.

199
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:07,999
Anybody who would like to contribute?

200
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:10,301
Okay, Stephan.

201
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:15,086
- Well, all I know is that where
we're located, we're at the,

202
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,074
we're pretty much the first
people that use our water,

203
00:09:17,074 --> 00:09:20,050
and then it goes downstream
for other people to use it, so,

204
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,075
so when we were talking about
eliminating the pollution,

205
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:29,516
the pollutants that we put into the water,

206
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:33,091
it's not, it wouldn't be
really affecting our city,

207
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,597
but the cities that are
down the stream from us.

208
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:38,600
- Okay, but this article
says that our, excuse me,

209
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,241
I think I read this wrong,

210
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,931
our state does not have a
problem with algae blooms.

211
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,803
- Regardless of the algae problem,

212
00:09:44,803 --> 00:09:47,838
it says without the
oxygen, the fish, bugs,

213
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,244
and other organisms that
live in the water will die,

214
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:53,179
and quoting from the same article it says

215
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:55,544
in the worst case scenario
you basically have water

216
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:58,216
devoid of all natural aquatic life.

217
00:09:58,216 --> 00:10:00,218
- But that's a worst case scenario

218
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:02,053
that we don't have right now

219
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:02,918
and we haven't had,

220
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,696
and it's not an issue in Colorado.

221
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:07,131
Granted, it might be an
issue in like Chesapeake Bay,

222
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,463
or Lake Erie.

223
00:10:08,463 --> 00:10:09,268
(Theo mumbles)

224
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,224
- But we don't have it here, it says so.

225
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:13,245
And multiple scientists have
backed that article as well.

226
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,466
- Now Corbin, do you
have any measurements,

227
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:18,479
or do you have some values
that you can back that up with?

228
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:21,038
- Not specifically on
nitrogen and phosphorous.

229
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,334
I tried to find some, but I found...

230
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:23,931
- So, does anybody have
any of that information

231
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:27,435
because we want to know
how close to danger are we.

232
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:28,697
(students talking quietly)

233
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,001
Do we know about current levels

234
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:31,683
or about where we want to go with this?

235
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:32,581
(female student mumbles)

236
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,645
- Okay I would like to comment on...

237
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:34,247
(Damon mumbles)

238
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,588
- I'm sorry, behind you,
I just called on her.

239
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:36,785
- Oh, excuse me.

240
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,640
- So, even if it's probable,

241
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,812
wouldn't you want to prevent it
from like happening here,

242
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,465
with the algae?

243
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:47,341
(Female student mumbles)

244
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,335
- Well, if it's not happening already then

245
00:10:49,335 --> 00:10:51,925
what do you have to do to
keep it from happening?

246
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,204
(Female student mumbles)

247
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:55,599
Yeah, if it happened, but
it hasn't happened yet.

248
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,911
- Yeah, but what she's saying
is it might happen.

249
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:57,876
- Yeah.

250
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,711
- I mean just saying that
something might happen

251
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,646
is just like saying something awful might.

252
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:03,935
I mean I could say that, you know,

253
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:06,155
an earthquake might
kill everyone tomorrow.

254
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,352
It might happen.

255
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:08,819
We don't know if it's going to happen.

256
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,058
- But fish and other organisms are dying.

257
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:12,222
It is happening.

258
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:14,355
It's not necessarily just the algae,

259
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,861
but it's the future problem.

260
00:11:15,861 --> 00:11:18,329
We've already seen issues with the...

261
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,632
- [Teacher] Yeah, let's
see what Nina has to say

262
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:20,563
as far as City Council.

263
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:21,814
- Well, I just have a question,

264
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,656
wouldn't it be better
to be safe than sorry?

265
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:27,338
_ You're right, it would be
better to be safe than sorry,

266
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,669
but like I said

267
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,679
the levels of toxins
in the water right now

268
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:37,319
do meet the EPA required standards.

269
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,542
So, therefore, it is a safe level

270
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:41,986
according to the scientists
who work for the EPA.

271
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,821
- But we're saying that the EPA standards

272
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,032
need to be improved.

273
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,458
- [Damon] Yes, yes, we realize that.

274
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,794
- Because they're not, they're too low,

275
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,283
and there are many chemicals that are new

276
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:54,418
because of new industry in metal companies

277
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:57,268
and many other things that
are dumping into streams.

278
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:59,470
And those chemicals are getting through.

279
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,836
- How would you go about doing this?

280
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,088
How would you go about
stopping the pollution?

281
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:05,977
Because something that's
important to remember here

282
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,606
is the fact that the
pollution is not only caused

283
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:11,999
by industry it's something
that's misconcepted,

284
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:14,485
is for example cars.

285
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,053
People think cars pollute the air,

286
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:18,288
and it exactly does pollute the air.

287
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,391
But when it goes up and
it becomes acid rain

288
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,827
and it falls back into our
creeks it's also a pollutant.

289
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,903
Therefore, industry's not the only people

290
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,163
who are polluting the lakes.

291
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:30,368
It's actually U.S. citizens
doing the same work too.

292
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:31,402
- [Teacher] Okay, I like that.

293
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,203
And so, can you be more specific?

294
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:35,372
Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip

295
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:38,509
about learning about which types of things

296
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,745
the citizens in our area are
putting down their drains?

297
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:41,250
- Yes.

298
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,346
- [Teacher] That may cause issues?

299
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:42,789
- Yes.

300
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:43,242
- [Teacher] Okay.

301
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:44,511
- I've got a whole bunch of them.

302
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:46,282
- [Teacher] Alright, Corbin,
why don't you share then

303
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:46,919
what it is?

304
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,658
- You want me to read all of them, or just?

305
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:50,812
- [Teacher] So, we're not
focusing just on one group.

306
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,187
There may be other groups as well,

307
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,178
but also maybe it could be addressed

308
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:55,696
as a result of this debate.
Go ahead, Corbin.

309
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:57,097
(male student mumbles)

310
00:12:57,097 --> 00:13:01,525
- Well, the guy that we
had giving us the tour

311
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,568
of the wastewater facility
did make some funny comments

312
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:06,062
that he's found some
pretty ridiculous things

313
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:08,102
in the water treatment plants.

314
00:13:08,102 --> 00:13:10,808
Some of those examples were
railroad ties, dentures,

315
00:13:10,808 --> 00:13:14,175
and he found a live person
inside of them one time.

316
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:17,716
So, it's not like the waste
treatment plant is purposely

317
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:18,677
putting all this out there.

318
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:20,932
It's, you can't stop humans
from putting out waste,

319
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:23,165
and a lot of the stuff that
they're putting in there

320
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,356
that they're actually reducing the levels

321
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:27,459
to parts per a billion
or parts per a trillion,

322
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,301
which some of the machines there do do,

323
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:31,996
are poisonous things like fluoride.

324
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:34,632
Which actually, the highest
water treatment plant

325
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,839
that puts out the most
fluoride is actually Mason,

326
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,302
which is right up there,

327
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:39,570
and lead and mercury.

328
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,406
And it eliminates that
from parts to a billion

329
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:42,924
from parts to a trillion.

330
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:46,055
(Damon and Corbin laugh)

331
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:47,162
- Well, first of all,

332
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:49,681
I would like to answer
Mr. Dunmar's question,

333
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,605
or Mr. Waz' question.

334
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:52,541
I'm sorry...

335
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,005
(Amanda mumbles)

336
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,365
We do have information

337
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:59,575
on how much nitrogen is required

338
00:13:59,575 --> 00:14:00,305
in the water,

339
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,860
and it's 10 parts per million.

340
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,412
So, that's just to answer that question,

341
00:14:04,412 --> 00:14:06,163
and then to move on to yours.

342
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:09,301
Yes, of course, as you
said in your own words,

343
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:13,771
you can't stop people from the
pollution that they do cause.

344
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:17,841
However, it is the job of
the water treatment plants

345
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,362
to kind of remove that
pollution and to produce

346
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:21,202
a safe environment.

347
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:24,882
And when we don't have
strict enough regulations

348
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:29,287
this environment is endangered
for not only for people,

349
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:32,123
but for also the
wildlife, for the economy,

350
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:36,092
for, you know, natural systems
that occur within Colorado.

351
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,096
It's all, you're putting
it all on the line.

352
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:40,499
- Okay, let's talk about
what would happen if we did

353
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,099
restrict pollutants
that go into the water.

354
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:43,693
- [Amanda] Okay.

355
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:45,512
- Well, let's talk about
the costs that everybody's, the citizens

356
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:46,313
are going to be paying

357
00:14:46,313 --> 00:14:49,131
that they said that all our
state is going to be paying.

358
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:52,413
- Before you talk about cost,
would you rather pay more

359
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,878
and be safe or pay less and risk dying?

360
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:57,282
- Okay. I would like to comment on that.

361
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:59,411
That's an asinine statement because

362
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:02,253
do you have a statistic on how many people

363
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,525
have died from water pollution?

364
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:07,019
- I do have a statement

365
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,129
from the

366
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,935
Secretary General of the
United Nations. Ban Ki-moon

367
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:20,271
says, "More people die from
unsafe water than from all

368
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:21,658
forms of violence including war."

369
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:24,235
- [Damon] You just said
from the United Nations.

370
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,453
- Yeah, this isn't,

371
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:28,562
yes, we're talking
about a local issue now,

372
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,928
but that is a statement that proves that.

373
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:32,897
- Okay, I would like to
comment on this once more,

374
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:33,832
when you said United Nations that's...

375
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:34,691
- [Teacher] Okay, I'm sorry.

376
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:36,673
We're going to have to go
to hand raising I believe

377
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:38,519
because we're getting
too fast of an answer

378
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,225
before someone gets a chance to finish.

379
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:41,825
So, Theo finish up,

380
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:43,628
and then Corbin will follow behind you.

381
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:44,612
(teacher mumbles)

382
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:45,757
- No, I made my point.

383
00:15:45,757 --> 00:15:46,652
- Okay.

384
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:50,444
- Well, like you said, you do
realize that's a local issue,

385
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:53,137
but the U.N. is United
Nations of the world.

386
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:54,479
So, that's not a local issue.

387
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,541
You're bringing up a fact that's
from countries like Africa

388
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:00,032
that don't have clean water
at all, nonetheless water.

389
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:01,872
So, of course they're going to
die from water poisoning,

390
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:04,149
but here in the United States,
we have the cleanest water

391
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:05,729
in the world, no matter where it is.

392
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,986
And Colorado also has one of the cleanest

393
00:16:07,986 --> 00:16:10,613
state populations of water, if you will,

394
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:11,728
out of all the states.

395
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:13,586
- Yeah, because of the
regulations we have in place,

396
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,800
and with the new chemicals

397
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,460
that are being put into our water,

398
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,159
we need to restrict our regulations.

399
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,317
- [Damon] What are the new chemicals?

400
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,844
- [Corbin] Yeah, they've
been there for awhile.

401
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,841
- We're having new problems though.

402
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:23,573
- [Damon] Can you explain it?

403
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,971
- Everything such as
nitrogen and phosphorous.

404
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,115
- [Corbin] It hasn't been an issue before.

405
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:27,834
Why is it an issue now?

406
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:28,597
- It has been an issue.

407
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:29,556
- It absolutely has.

408
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,579
- It has happened all
over the United States.

409
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,451
- [Damon] Okay, when
we talk about nitrogen,

410
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,031
we're talking about if we restrict that

411
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,231
we're talking about maybe
shutting down part of

412
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,922
what we do here.

413
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:43,664
As we all know that we
are, we do grow many crops

414
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:45,025
in our state.

415
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:49,080
And nitrogen, mostly where it comes from,

416
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,143
is fertilizers used in that industry.

417
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:55,842
So, to say that we're going to
restrict nitrogen would be,

418
00:16:55,842 --> 00:16:59,571
we might have to restrict
or shut down some industries

419
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:00,978
that do produce food.

420
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,706
- [Amanda] Such as what? What industries?

421
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:03,524
- For fertilizers.

422
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:04,015
- Fertilizers.

423
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,590
- You can't use fertilizers on your lawn

424
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,711
because if you have...

425
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:07,752
- And not even lawn, crops.

426
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,958
- Crops, lawns, anything
because the fertilizer you use

427
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,052
goes down drains,

428
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:13,184
which go into creeks,

429
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:15,152
which is really polluting
it more than the wastewater

430
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,254
facility was.

431
00:17:16,254 --> 00:17:18,089
- So, shouldn't the wastewater
facility pollute it less

432
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,591
since we already have natural pollution

433
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:20,958
coming from these facilities?

434
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,026
(Amanda mumbles)

435
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:25,658
- We're already doing so much to prevent

436
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:28,231
these chemicals from going into...

437
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:31,521
- Okay so Will, I hear you're
saying that we're doing a lot.

438
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,682
What was learned on the
field trip? Specifically

439
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:36,539
what role do the scientists play

440
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,466
who are employed by our city?

441
00:17:38,466 --> 00:17:42,439
What role do they play at the
wastewater treatment plant?

442
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:45,316
And how does that affect
your group's goals

443
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:46,619
for today's debate?

444
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:49,877
What are the scientists
doing, specifically,

445
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:52,011
and how does it support your side?

446
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:55,868
(classroom mumbles)

447
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,737
- Like they said on the fieldtrip,

448
00:17:57,737 --> 00:18:01,464
they use bacteria, E.coli,

449
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:04,414
to break down the wastewater

450
00:18:04,414 --> 00:18:05,871
that's in the water.

451
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:08,887
It's not like they're
adding pollutions to it.

452
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:12,388
Their job is to take it out,
which they are trying to do.

453
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:17,383
By doing that, they add some
phosphorous and nitrates

454
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,054
that are just byproducts of it,

455
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:22,819
but they remove a lot of those afterwards.

456
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:26,583
It's not like to clean it 100%,

457
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,546
it's going to cost 25 billion dollars,

458
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:32,053
and that's just for the state of Colorado.

459
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:36,436
- [Teacher] Okay, let's see
a City Council members.

460
00:18:36,436 --> 00:18:37,334
I'm trying to get to them quickly.

461
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,140
I'm sorry, Amanda, behind you, Stephan.

462
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,750
- Where did you get that information that

463
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,124
it would cost 25 billion dollars?

464
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:43,039
- [Damon] This is from the Gazettte.

465
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,739
- [Cole] The Gazette article.

466
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:44,709
- [Corbin] It's from the article.

467
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,468
- Science has proven that to
remove nitrogen and phosphorous

468
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:49,281
from the water,

469
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:52,499
which is you guys's goal to restrict it,

470
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:55,913
it's going to cost about 25 billion
dollars to remove it all.

471
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,444
If you just want to do parts of it,

472
00:18:57,444 --> 00:19:00,174
it's still going to be 2.46 billion dollars.

473
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:02,482
- Which is four times
the amount of what it is

474
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,324
costing right now to remove
the things from the water.

475
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:05,411
- Wouldn't that be better tough than 
having to

476
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,083
fix up a completely good
stream that destroys the economy.

477
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,197
- Well I actually, on the fieldtrip,

478
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,316
I asked several of the
chemists that work there

479
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:15,317
whether the pollutants that
we put into Fountain Creek

480
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,041
and what we're doing for the environment,

481
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,176
and they said the water they
put back into Fountain Creek

482
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:20,537
is the water they get out of it.

483
00:19:20,537 --> 00:19:21,470
It's cleaner than that.

484
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,311
- Yeah.

485
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:23,965
- So, in my opinion,

486
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,731
that statement is totally absurd.

487
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,844
We're putting cleaner water for nature,

488
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:29,092
and nature seems to enjoy it more

489
00:19:29,092 --> 00:19:30,896
as I asked the chemist as well.

490
00:19:30,896 --> 00:19:32,994
And farmers down stream
also enjoy that water

491
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:34,068
to water their crops,

492
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:35,500
and it helps their crops grow more than

493
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,289
Fountain Creek's streams already.

494
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:39,009
- [Teacher] Excellent point, Corbin.

495
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,329
Why don't we try Alexis and
see what she has to say.

496
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:45,434
- I have a question as to
how the water pollutants

497
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,037
destroy the economy.

498
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:48,706
You can say a lot about the economy.

499
00:19:50,486 --> 00:19:51,989
- [Damon] What do you
mean by water pollutants

500
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:53,384
destroying the economy?

501
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,978
- Well you say that...
