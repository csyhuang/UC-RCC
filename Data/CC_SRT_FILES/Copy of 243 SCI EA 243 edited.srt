you're going to be looking

your shoulder partners, okay?

what is in common, how
is the data aligned?

- The heat that was trapped inside,

24

the heat that was trapped
inside got trapped

because the black it was on,

26

and the black soaks in the heat,

27
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:28,684
so when the black soaks in
the heat into the covers,

it traps it into.

about the black, look at your other.

highest on both sheets.

- White uncovered.

went down.

What's another scientific word
for going down, everybody?

- Decrease.

- That the rankings
were the same for each one.

talking about the rankings,

what are you meaning?

67
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:16,282
- Like, white uncover had

68
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:18,414
decreased the most.

69
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,325
- Uh huh.

71
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,121
was really toward the middle.

- Black uncovered was also,

- You all see the same thing?

80
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:47,322
Now, what does it mean that black covered

81
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:50,110
had more of a change than white uncovered?

82

What does that mean, Justin?

83
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,640
- That black absorbed more heat.

84
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,682
- Okay, that black
maybe absorbed the most.

85
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,086
And what did the white do?

00:03:58,086 --> 00:03:59,478
Everybody?

87
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,114
- It reflected.

88

- It reflected, or Anthony,
what were you gonna say?

89
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:04,872
- Absorbed the least.

90
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,562
- Absorbed the least,
because it was reflecting.

00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,695
Where was the sun in
the afternoon, Anthony?

168
00:09:13,695 --> 00:09:17,494
- It was like barely...

169
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,757
- Okay, okay, Semijah.

170
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:23,202
- It was in the clouds.

171
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:24,122
- Okay, it was,

172
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:26,200
sometimes it was going behind the clouds.

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,645
Where was it, Alex,
where was it in the sky?

174
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,518
You don't remember?

175
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:33,962
- Behind the school.

176
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:35,600
- Okay, behind the school.

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,704
So this was our morning experiment,

178
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,468
and this was our afternoon experiment.

179
00:09:41,468 --> 00:09:44,745
Okay, and did we get
different kinds of data?

180
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:49,294
Because what was truly
pretty much the same?

181
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:52,123
Between both days, besides the sun,

182
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,434
what was the air
temperature in the morning?

183
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,365
[Background Chatter]

184
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,159
24, what was it in the afternoon?

185
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,159
- 25.

186
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,747
- 25. Okay, so our air
temperature stayed the same,

187
00:10:02,747 --> 00:10:05,377
but the thing that was
different was what?

188
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,554
- Where the sun was.

189
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,467
- Where the sun was, okay.

190
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,273
So thinking about that,

191
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:14,841
we are going to try to get

192
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:19,736
a solar water heater
installed at the school, okay,

193
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,629
a solar water heater
installed at the school,

194
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:26,940
so what other, do y'all
know, a solar water heater,

195
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,118
a hot water heater in your house, okay.

196
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:31,517
When you get in the
shower or get in the bath

197
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:32,828
and you have warm water,

198
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:34,361
how do you think that water's heated?

199
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:35,454
Does anyone know?

200
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,157
Peyton?

201
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:39,662
- You have the water in your,

202
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:42,763
well you have a water heater
in your garage or um --

203
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:46,221
- Okay, it's in your garage,
but what's heating that water?

204
00:10:46,221 --> 00:10:47,059
- The sun?
- No.
