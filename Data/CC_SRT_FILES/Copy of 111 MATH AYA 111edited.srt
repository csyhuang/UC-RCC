1
00:00:00,818 --> 00:00:02,954
- [Teacher] Can someone
come up and put number one

2
00:00:02,954 --> 00:00:04,284
on the graph?

3
00:00:04,284 --> 00:00:06,063
And then we're going to debate about it.

4
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:08,137
Anassia, can you come up
and show us where you think

5
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,571
one should be?

6
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:21,383
(background chatter)

7
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,833
- [Anassia] Alright so, what I think is,

8
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,614
I don't know if I'm right
or wrong or whatever,

9
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:29,628
but I thought kinda one is there.

10
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,369
Do you guys see it?

11
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:32,124
- [male student] No

12
00:00:32,124 --> 00:00:37,893
(giggling)

13
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,414
- [teacher] OK back, can
you give us a reason why?

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:42,688
- [Anassia] OK, well it
says David had drived back

15
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:45,045
to pick up his credit card that he forgot

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,887
at the restaurant, so I
kinda think that from home,

17
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:50,431
the restaurant must be close,

18
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:52,753
that's why he took the chance

19
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:53,694
to go back to get his credit card.

20
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,632
We don't know if he has
money on him, ya know?

21
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:58,198
It could depend on
circumstances, but I think that

22
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:01,855
the restaurant was hella close,

23
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:06,057
that's why he went back
and went back home.

24
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,613
- [teacher] OK, wait, wait, wait.

25
00:01:07,613 --> 00:01:09,931
Wait, wait, wait. wait. OK.

26
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:12,323
So, honestly who has that opinion?

27
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,331
So you think one is at the very beginning

28
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:15,063
- [Beth] Mmmhmmm.

29
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:15,945
- [teacher] of his trip?

30
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:19,637
OK, can we have someone
else draw another number one

31
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:20,832
that is in a different place?

32
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:26,002
Anassia, can you pick someone?

33
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,289
- [Anassia] Overwhelming. You.

34
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:34,490
(laughter)

35
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,155
- [Male Student] I put it right here.

36
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:39,813
Right there.

37
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:42,873
(background chatter)

38
00:01:42,873 --> 00:01:48,683
Right there.

39
00:01:48,683 --> 00:01:49,873
- [Teacher] OK, can you give us a reason?

40
00:01:49,873 --> 00:01:51,151
- [Male Student] He's driving and then he

41
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:54,831
goes to the restaurant,
and then he's driving away.

42
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:58,429
No! This is the restaurant right here,

43
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:59,985
and then he's leaving
and he's like, "Oh snap,

44
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:02,249
I left my credit card." Then he goes back

45
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:06,103
and then he's driving away.

46
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:13,943
That's it.

47
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,942
- [teacher] OK wait, so

48
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,809
whose idea do we agree with?

49
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,175
Sidius or Anassia?

50
00:02:19,175 --> 00:02:21,357
- [class] Sidius

51
00:02:21,357 --> 00:02:23,180
- [Teacher] - OK, but we
still have to convince Anassia

52
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,735
because she still thinks
it's at the beginning, right?

53
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:27,378
- [Male Student] I thought
it was at the beginning too.

54
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:28,718
- [Teacher] You did? Who convinced you?

55
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:29,827
- [Male Student] Myself.

56
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:30,749
- [Teacher] Yourself?

57
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,475
(laughter)

58
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:35,772
- [Teacher] OK, so if
David is driving back

59
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:41,554
to the restaurant, then should his slope

60
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:43,039
be what? What should his slope be?

61
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,910
- [Class] Negative.

62
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,952
- [Teacher] If he's going
back to the restaurant?

63
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:49,610
Right, because if I'm travelling this way,

64
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,617
my slope's getting bigger, my
distance is getting farther,

65
00:02:52,617 --> 00:02:55,379
But wait, I turn back
so my slope has to be?

66
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,912
- Negative.

67
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:59,072
- Negative. So do you think one

68
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:00,674
is when the slope gets negative?

69
00:03:00,674 --> 00:03:01,417
- [Male Student] Yeah.

70
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:04,272
- So are you convinced now Anasstia?

71
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:07,241
That it has to be negative
for him to go back?

72
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,203
- [Anasstia] Yeah.

73
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,339
- So are we OK with
erasing that first one?

74
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:12,942
[Anastassia] Well I have
to erase all of it anyway.

75
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,777
(teacher laughs)

76
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,705
- Oh OK, sorry. OK.

77
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,701
So one should be where
he's going back, right,

78
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:19,338
where he's going negative, OK? Alright.

79
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:22,798
[Anasstia] Is there a real end to it?

80
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:24,086
- Well we're going to see
once we get through them.

81
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:24,945
[Anasstia] Alright.

82
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:26,106
- So, Sidi, can you pick the next person

83
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:31,147
to show us where number two should be?

84
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:54,153
- [Sidius] No hands?

85
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:58,786
- [Female Student] I would put two here.

86
00:03:58,786 --> 00:04:02,102
- [teacher] Can you explain why, Candy?

87
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,238
Wait, just give us an explanation.

88
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:06,096
- [Candy] Yeah, because he said

89
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:13,948
that his car breaks down so he goes back

90
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:16,579
so the slope is negative.

91
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:22,011
He went back.

92
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,869
- [Class] Close to his house.

93
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:28,351
- Yeah, near his house, but
then it's near the beginning

94
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:36,060
so the bilaterals have to be near zero.

95
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,367
Because the line there
represents the distance

96
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:46,125
from his home, right?

97
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,704
- [Female Student] I've got a question.

98
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,004
- OK

99
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:52,672
- You know how it says he is told a way

100
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,191
to a repair shop near his house?

101
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,108
We're looking at his car,

102
00:04:57,108 --> 00:05:05,430
not looking at the tow away car, aren't we?

103
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,436
So wouldn't it be considered constant

104
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:16,532
since his car is moving?

105
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:18,197
[Teacher] - So I guess the car
is on the tow truck, right?

106
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:21,378
So now, wherever the tow truck goes,

107
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:22,911
the car has to go, right?

108
00:05:22,911 --> 00:05:24,618
- [Classroom] Yeah

109
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:26,939
- [Teacher] Does anyone
have a different place

110
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:29,179
for number two?

111
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:32,396
- [Classroom] No

112
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:34,149
- [Teacher] So we all agree that two,

113
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:37,663
no, do you want to put
two in a different place?

114
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,472
Put it in a different place.
Let's see what you think.

115
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:56,670
Put it in a different place,
let's see what you think. Go.

116
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,786
- [Male Student] I was thinking
of putting it right here.

117
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:00,146
That's what I was thinking.

118
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:02,022
- [Female Student] That's
what I thought too.

119
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:03,425
- [Teacher] Can you explain why? Why?

120
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:07,662
- [Male Student] Because he
says that his car broke down

121
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:11,261
and was towed back to his house.

122
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:13,350
So I was thinking that the first sentence,

123
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,127
so his car broke down.

124
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:17,124
So if he was not going anywhere,

125
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:19,980
then the time was going then constant,

126
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,475
so if, as you see the time,
his speed never changes

127
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:28,735
while the time is just going down.

128
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:36,373
That's what I think.

129
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,499
- [Male Student Sitting] That's wrong.

130
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,867
(laughter)

131
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,272
- [Teacher] We don't say that's wrong,

132
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:47,019
we say, "Well, I disagree. Well."

133
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:50,421
So convince him otherwise.

134
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,928
- [Male Student Sitting]
Because the car is still moving,

135
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:55,878
and if you look really,
really closer at the graph,

136
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:58,501
the last point isn't directly on the girl

137
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,485
so we can assume that since it says the

138
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:04,085
the repair shop is near his house

139
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,917
that the ending point would have to be

140
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:08,904
somewhere near zero.

141
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:11,219
Also, if it was constant,
that means he would just

142
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,668
be in one spot, but
it's clearly saying that

143
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:16,919
he's being towed back
towards the repair shop,

144
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,307
so he's in motion, like the
slope is showing distance

145
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:28,194
and not speed.

146
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:32,629
Well the graph is showing that
the slope is going somewhere.

147
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:35,822
- [Teacher] So can I say two things?

148
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,423
One thing, so it's a
different interpretation

149
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,769
of this problem, right?

150
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:43,240
So if he was broken down and
the car was just staying there,

151
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,967
then would this be a good place for two?

152
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,383
- [Class] Yes.

153
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:49,567
- If the car was just staying there

154
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,562
because distance is not
changing or is changing?

155
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:57,502
It's not changing, right?

156
00:07:57,502 --> 00:08:02,260
Because time is going on, but
distance is staying the same.

157
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,702
However, number two says
he's going to the repair shop

158
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,257
close to his house.

159
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:09,277
So is he just staying
in one place? No, right?

160
00:08:09,277 --> 00:08:11,843
So he's gonna go back home,

161
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:14,440
so if he's going back home
so this slope would be

162
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,289
negative or positive?

163
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,471
- [Class] Negative.

164
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:18,506
- Negative.

165
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:20,383
And it's going, here's home, right?

166
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:23,343
So where does he go back
home? Or very close to home?

167
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:28,989
Here, right? Are you convinced Danny?

168
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:30,692
- [Danny] Yes.

169
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:34,489
- OK, let's erase the other number two.

170
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,056
But Danny, thank you for being brave

171
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:39,757
because I could understand
that interpretation.

172
00:08:39,757 --> 00:08:43,288
Alright, Danny, can you pick
someone to put number three

173
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:55,521
on the graph?

174
00:08:55,521 --> 00:09:00,504
- [Female Student] OK, number three

175
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:05,920
is over here.

176
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,126
- [Female Student Sitting] I disagree.

177
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,021
- [Teacher] Wait, wait.

178
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:08,822
(laughter)

179
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,238
We haven't even heard her explanation.

180
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:12,920
Wendy, what's your explanation why?

181
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,763
- [Wendy] Because it's stopped for gas and
got a quick bite to eat

182
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:27,478
it's kinda constant here
so it can be stopped.

183
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:28,684
- [Girl Student Sitting]
So why not the long one?

184
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:33,688
- [Wendy] Because he's in
the restaurant, I suppose.

185
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:37,031
- But then

186
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:39,744
- So if one is here, if one is here,

187
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:43,291
it has to be in the
restaurant then, right?

188
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,834
- Well then one is over
there, so then why would

189
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:50,605
three be all the way over there?

190
00:09:50,605 --> 00:09:52,773
- One is here, right?

191
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,897
- No, no, no. One is all
the way at the beginning.

192
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,372
- No.

193
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,939
- Sorry, that's "Y."

194
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:02,118
(laughter)

195
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:06,390
But then it says that he got a three.

196
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,896
- Yes, but it's here.

197
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:14,203
- Yeah, he ate there, so
wouldn't that be the one?

198
00:10:14,203 --> 00:10:17,082
Like wouldn't that be
where he gets his gas?

199
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:18,696
[Girl Student Sitting Number
Two] Number three said

200
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:21,018
that he went to eat,
but it doesn't say where

201
00:10:21,018 --> 00:10:24,758
did he eat. Maybe he just
eat at that restaurant

202
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,241
that he mention about.

203
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:28,785
- [Girl Student Sitting] Yeah,
maybe he went a bit farther,

204
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:29,968
and said, "OK, let me go
somewhere else," so that's why.

205
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:32,047
- [Wendy] So what did he do here?

206
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:35,134
- [Class] Eat and gas.

207
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:41,793
(laughter)

208
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:44,509
- It doesn't take that long to eat.

209
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:54,721
(background chatter)

210
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,339
- [Girl Student Sitting] One hour?

211
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,936
People take a bit to
longer to fill up on gas

212
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:03,478
and then they can't just eat
while they're getting gas.

213
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:10,095
Oh let me eat while I'm getting gas.

214
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:13,461
- [Teacher] OK, so are we
going to take a longer time

215
00:11:13,461 --> 00:11:17,409
at the restaurant or a longer
time at the gas station?

216
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,930
- [Class] The restaurant.

217
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,812
- The restaurant.

218
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:23,315
So do we want the slope to be
zero for a long period of time

219
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:24,777
or just for a short period of time?

220
00:11:24,777 --> 00:11:26,297
- Short

221
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,097
- Shorter than wherever you pick

222
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:30,481
where the restaurant is, right?

223
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,147
So we haven't gotten to the
restaurant yet, have we?

224
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:34,448
- No.

225
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:36,944
- No, OK.

226
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:43,212
So could three be the place
where he stops and gets gas?

227
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:45,047
Could it be?

228
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:47,530
- [Class] Possibly. We
don't know if quick bite

229
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,572
meant one hour or meant half an hour.

230
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:51,675
- Or maybe it meant (snaps fingers)

231
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,335
five minutes?

232
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:54,438
- Yeah you know, you never know.

233
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,331
So if we interpreted five minutes, gas

234
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,199
and quick bite, quick sandwich.

235
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,138
Could we put three at that place?

236
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,276
- Yes.

237
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:02,459
- Why?

238
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,177
- [Wendy] Because the
slope is almost constant

239
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:12,107
for a short period of time.

240
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,790
- [Girl Sitting in Class
Number Two] I think that at

241
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,194
three, he went back to the restaurant

242
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,875
to get his credit card.

243
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,290
- [Wendy] Maybe the gas
station is near the restaurant.

244
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,164
(laughter)

245
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:28,880
- [Male Student] Why you
make this so difficult?

246
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,183
- [Teacher] That's possible, though, right?

247
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:33,664
I'm like thinking of
putting at the beginning?

248
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:35,892
- Here?

249
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:38,239
- Here is four.

250
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,841
- [Girl Student Sitting] Wait, wait, wait.

251
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:45,359
Don't go on four yet.

252
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,480
- [Girl Student Sitting Number
Two] But I think the three

253
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,883
should be before one.

254
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:54,062
Because you can't just
eat in the restaurant

255
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,786
and then you eat a quick sandwich,

256
00:12:56,786 --> 00:13:09,819
(background chatter)

257
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:11,165
- [Teacher] OK, we're going to do this

258
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,090
because I like the debate you're having,

259
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,730
but I want groups to think
about it individually,

260
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,875
and then we're going to come back.

261
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,546
but I want to put one thing
for sure on the board.

262
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:25,635
OK, so

263
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:31,690
If, if, if, if. If,

264
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,804
If this is definitely

265
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:35,514
Let's say this is definitely

266
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,418
where David stopped to eat.

267
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,202
OK, so this is where David is eating.

268
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:44,281
[Girl Student Sitting] Eating
as in, in the restaurant?

269
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,198
- Eating at the restaurant, yes.

270
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,938
So here David is eating for a long time

271
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,735
at the restaurant, OK?

272
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,558
A long, long time. So that's the longest,

273
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:54,775
is this the longest time
where the slope is flat?

274
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:57,840
Yeah. So we're all gonna agree right now

275
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,533
that this is where David is
eating at the restaurant.

276
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:03,423
So this is where David is
eating at the restaurant,

277
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:07,336
can you put all the other
numbers in a logical place?

278
00:14:07,336 --> 00:14:09,100
Because I hear you guys
talking about logic.

279
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,839
Like he can't go to the gas
station before he does what?

280
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,298
- Goes to the restaurant
and gets his credit card.

281
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:19,781
- OK, so, I see that's
one logical statement so,

282
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:21,882
in your groups, I'm gonna give
you five minutes for this.

283
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:25,133
Can you put one, two, three,
and four in a logical place

284
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:28,220
and have a good argument for it? OK.
