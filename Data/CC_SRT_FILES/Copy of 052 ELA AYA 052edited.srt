1
00:00:01,071 --> 00:00:03,570
- Love the many questions
that you're asking.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,110
Asking questions is a great way,

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,390
especially if you're wondering something.

4
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,071
Feel free to ask it, even if you go

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:10,031
in a little bit different direction.

6
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,812
Also, the more you reference the book,

7
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:15,072
you can give us some things
going on in "Brave New World"

8
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:16,912
and the more specific you can be,

9
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:19,103
the better that helps us understand

10
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,271
somebody actually connected to the book

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,171
and maybe how it's connected to them.

12
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:25,350
So two things to be thinking about.

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,390
But if you give examples,
the more specific you can,

14
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,910
of real world examples
also the better off.

15
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,350
You guys are doing a
fantastic job, though.

16
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,870
Talking, having a natural conversation,

17
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,671
letting each other speak and all that.

18
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,001
So, continue with the next question.

19
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:39,990
- Are we doing that on here?

20
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,951
- What's that?

21
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,783
- Are we doing what we're
supposed to in here?

22
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:46,351
- Yeah, and my outside
people, ya'll are doing fine

23
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:48,840
continue with whatever
you want to put on here.

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,551
As long as it's related to
the conversation, obviously.

25
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:56,391
- Ya'll want to talk
about Bernard & John now?

26
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,041
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

27
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:03,150
- Alright, how do these characters
show a variety of ideas

28
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,063
about individualism and conformity?

29
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:08,391
I'll just kind of start out.

30
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,862
Here's my answer, I kind of
said that they were like,

31
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,345
the Russians who wanted their blue jeans.

32
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:17,751
They knew what they wanted
and they kinda went for it.

33
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,192
And in the end, society
pretty much pushed them back

34
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,071
into their place.

35
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:25,921
And was like, "No, don't stand
up and rise up against us."

36
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:31,050
- Well, I would say, I see a similarity

37
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,471
between, like, Bernard and John

38
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:35,030
because they both had individual ideals

39
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,271
but I definitely that John was
a lot stronger in his beliefs

40
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:39,344
than Bernard was because I think about how

41
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:42,631
Bernard had, at first,
he was all individual

42
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:46,080
and he had these individual
beliefs and then when he,

43
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,371
when they got in trouble,
kind of in a way,

44
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:49,385
all three of them,

45
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:51,471
with the uprising and
all that kind of stuff.

46
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:54,591
He kind of went back
on what he was saying.

47
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,871
And John, he stuck to it,

48
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,264
like he actually did something about it.

49
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:58,151
When he actually kind of protested

50
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,150
and he was able to go back
to being an individual.

51
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,870
And he went into doing his own
thing, with his own beliefs.

52
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,390
So, I just feel like
John was a lot stronger

53
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,792
in what he believed
throughout it than Bernard,

54
00:02:10,792 --> 00:02:12,310
who was kind of allowing people

55
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,992
to look at him, put on him, worried about

56
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:16,863
what other people thought about him

57
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:18,502
and all that kind of stuff.

58
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:19,390
- That's true.

59
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,431
Cuz like, whenever Bernard was more of

60
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:28,184
I guess a weirdo, he does
always, like, question society

61
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:29,991
and why everybody acts the way they do.

62
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:32,400
But as soon as he started being
popular, he started bragging

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,231
to Helmholtz about how,
like right here it says,

64
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,391
"And I had six girls
last week: one on Monday,

65
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,391
"two on Tuesday, two more
on Friday, one on Saturday."

66
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:42,023
So, as soon as he became
just like everybody else,

67
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:46,051
he started to like it far more
and it mattered much to him

68
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:50,231
that people like, people
did what they did,

69
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,191
like not explicit
relationships and everything.

70
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:55,581
So, you're right, John
was stronger than Bernard.

71
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,671
- I don't think John ever conformed,

72
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:02,311
he stuck to his beliefs
pretty much the whole time.

73
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:04,871
- Yeah, he always stayed
an individual like,

74
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,384
he made sure he didn't conform.

75
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:11,871
- Was Helmholtz conformist
or individualistic?

76
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:13,750
Because he did a lot of the
same things that, you know,

77
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,291
normal people do

78
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,840
but he also read as an idealism at times.

79
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,760
(background chatter)

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,121
- I think he's somebody who

81
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:29,421
he conformed to what he
had to, just to get by.

82
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,071
But at the same time,
he had his own thoughts

83
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:33,270
and believed what he believed.

84
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,540
I just don't think he really stood up

85
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,270
for what he believed in.

86
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,480
- So we're (background chatter)

87
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,224
- Yeah, I think so.

88
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:43,231
It's almost like it's almost
like a fair weather friend.

89
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:46,241
He did what was best for
him, to keep him going

90
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,343
got hit and suffered trouble.


91
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:53,551
- I feel like, I don't
know, maybe I'm crazy

92
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:55,831
but I thought Helmholtz
was like, reminds me of,

93
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:59,311
this is stereotypical, but
he kind of reminds me of like

94
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,631
an old professor, you know?

95
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,111
He, like, just like goes to work.

96
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,511
Helmholtz has, like,
good thoughts about stuff

97
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,742
but then he didn't like, live the life.

98
00:04:07,742 --> 00:04:10,610
- Wasn't he some sort of,

99
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,780
- He was like a top guy,

100
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,310
- professor.

101
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,190
A psychologist, or something?
- He was a scientist.

102
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,591
(laughing)

103
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:27,591
- Alright, so kind of
sticking on that topic.

104
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,311
What about the books and how they,

105
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,570
nobody really read how they kind of,

106
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,530
all of the books related to, I guess,

107
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,870
individuality and the whole
world, what life was like before

108
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,791
(bell rings)

109
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,951
was locked up.

110
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,531
(bell rings)

111
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:50,591
- I can say the same, John
was reading Shakespeare

112
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,671
and how Shakespeare is all
about, like, love and tragedy

113
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:56,710
and there's like sorrow
and there's also, you know,

114
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,543
the aspect of love with "Romeo & Juliet."

115
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,950
And how the people didn't really,

116
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,671
Helmholtz would, his job
was reading it to them

117
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,952
and he started laughing about it

118
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:07,071
because he was trained not to.

119
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:09,471
So, I think if people
actually read about it,

120
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:12,311
you know, the feelings and
how love is supposed to be.

121
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,590
Then people wouldn't go along
with how their relationships

122
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,951
would be because they'd
wanna, maybe wanna experience

123
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,951
falling in love with someone
or having that one person

124
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:22,951
would cause a lot more
problems with that knowledge

125
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:26,665
along with seeing how
people, how there's tragedy.

126
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:29,310
People are becoming sad and
how in the New World people are

127
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,590
always supposed to be happy
and everyone's getting along.

128
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,152
Then in these stories,
there's like love conflict

129
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:36,111
and everyone is fighting
and it would cause problems

130
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,441
because from that, people could form

131
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,591
their own individual problems

132
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,644
and then they start to have
their own individuality

133
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:45,480
and form opinions and
start asking questions,

134
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,862
which leads to a lot of things.

135
00:05:47,862 --> 00:05:51,465
- Books are they pretty much written

136
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:53,244
to express those emotions

137
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:56,300
in which the whole state is
trying to block up anyways?

138
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,031
That was why they're there.

139
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:03,191
- So, the book, do you
think that the books

140
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:06,911
are kind of what drove
Bernard to be a nonconformist

141
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:10,231
and then as he got away from reading,

142
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:12,590
and he started conforming
back into society?

143
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,031
- What I think happened,
cuz they were saying,

144
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,191
I think he was like bipolar or something

145
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,902
and everyone else was like
(inaudible speech) something.

146
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:23,303
He was shorter than everyone else

147
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:27,151
and, I think, he was already
kind of like put aside

148
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:29,391
'cause they were saying that
they think he had alcohol

149
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:33,270
given to him as he was a
baby so that made him weird.

150
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,271
So, all along, he wasn't
like everyone else.

151
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:40,271
So, he wasn't a, like, no one
accepted him for who he was

152
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:43,511
but whenever he got famous, or whatever,

153
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:45,150
people began to accept him.

154
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,911
(inaudible talking)
- Huh?

155
00:06:47,911 --> 00:06:49,271
- He wasn't able to conform,
is that what you're saying?

156
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:50,671
- Yeah, I don't think
he was able to conform

157
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:51,911
because no one accepted
him for who he was,

158
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,311
except for Helmholtz.

159
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,471
- I think if someone
else was in his position,

160
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:59,472
like read, even like saw a book,
they probably wouldn't even

161
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,310
try to read the way he did.

162
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,950
They were so used to not, I
don't know, not having books.

163
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,350
I don't think the same thing
would happen to somebody else.

164
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,791
It kind of reminds me of,
I don't know if you guys

165
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,032
have seen the movie, "The Book of Eli"?

166
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:17,428
How, the entire time, he's
trying to hide the Bible

167
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,950
because that one guy wants the Bible

168
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,510
because he wants control over everybody.

169
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,231
Because like, if he has,
like everything in the Bible,

170
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,791
he could like tell people certain things

171
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,351
and they would just listen to
him so he could be a master.

172
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:31,431
Like, in this book, how
everybody, like the Controllers

173
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,311
just want control over everybody

174
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:35,311
and without books, like,

175
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:38,010
I think it's just another
type of their control.

176
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,841
- That's a good example.

177
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:44,991
- Also, if you think
about it, present day,

178
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,751
a lot of people don't
even read books anymore.

179
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,831
They mostly know that they
can (inaudible speech)

180
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,321
and you can watch the movies instead.

181
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,870
There is also technology where
you can learn about something

182
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,700
without even actually
having to read the book.

183
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,311
So, do you think in a
way, that's kind of like

184
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:02,911
the same way of eliminating,

185
00:08:02,911 --> 00:08:04,971
how they did in the story

186
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,223
and how they eliminate books

187
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:07,711
and there's more technology
is like a weakness?

188
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:10,991
Today, you know, we're
all about technology

189
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,663
so we eliminate more books
and there's more movies

190
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:14,943
and more technology.

191
00:08:14,943 --> 00:08:17,950
- Real quick, I wanna throw in one scene

192
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,830
that I want you guys to think about, also.

193
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:25,131
You just brought up a point about

194
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,131
if people in the world today

195
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:30,391
saw these books, would they
even know what to do with them?

196
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,240
What would they think about them?

197
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,191
We do have a point in "Brave
New World" where someone

198
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:38,060
does see a book that isn't used to seeing

199
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,231
these type of books and responds to it.

200
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:43,430
When Helmholtz looks at

201
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,012
the Shakespeare that John has.

202
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:48,191
So, what did you make
of Helmholtz's response

203
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:49,991
to Shakespeare?

204
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,591
And what do you think that maybe suggests

205
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:54,622
about people's attitudes
in the World State?

206
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:58,711
Especially since, the Helmholtz
would represent, I guess,

207
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,351
an enlightened view
point in the World State.

208
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,631
You remember the scene
that I'm talking about?

209
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,383
- Yeah (background chatter).

210
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:07,270
- Yeah, he started off by
laughing at it and didn't,

211
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,552
later on in the scene,
he kind of hid the fact

212
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:13,231
that he had read it and that
he knew what was going on?

213
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:17,831
- I'm just wondering where it all

214
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:20,651
- It's page 183.

215
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:46,371
(bell ringing)

216
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:56,270
- Page 184 says, the second paragraph,

217
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,951
like third or fourth line,

218
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:01,666
"Helmholtz said listen to the

219
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:05,912
"scenes of the world first
meeting with a puzzled interest."

220
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,511
I mean, I guess being
the enlightened thinker,

221
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,950
Helmholtz is kinda curious about it,

222
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,790
and wanted to know more.

223
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,411
But at the same time,
he had that conformity

224
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:23,880
which was kinda scaring him away from it.

225
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,113
Cuz he didn't want to
get in trouble, I guess.

226
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:31,521
- He doesn't really seem to
understand what's going on in

227
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,387
"Romeo & Juliet" because
at the bottom of page 184,

228
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:36,471
same page we saw him laughing about it

229
00:10:36,471 --> 00:10:39,871
because he didn't understand
why the mother and father

230
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,271
are trying to force the daughter
on someone she didn't want.

231
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:46,110
So, I mean, it just kind of
shows how different things were.

232
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,190
- I guess that goes back to
the differences in society

233
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,751
between then and now.

234
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,162
For now and the future.

235
00:10:55,162 --> 00:11:04,950
- Like to do the last
comments about John or Bernard

236
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,991
comparing and contrasting?

237
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:11,071
- I come up with something that
didn't really get mentioned

238
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,751
John, the reason he's an individual is

239
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:16,672
'cause he was born, he was
like literally, born

240
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:20,271
and grew up on the reservation.

241
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,271
Bernard, the reason he's an individual is

242
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,310
because of his physical stature.

243
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:30,310
So, Bernard is an individual
because of physically,

244
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,151
but John is different
because of who he is.

245
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,344
He was born like that,
so that's what makes,

246
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:40,591
they're two different people
in individuality standard.

247
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:45,463
And that's why, I thought
that Bernard was so easy to

248
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:47,430
go back to conformity,

249
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,104
because the only thing
that made him different

250
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,791
was his height.

251
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,191
And that's why John couldn't
because of who he was.

252
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:58,321
- I thought Bernard was

253
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:02,231
the person that John would be

254
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:07,231
if John had been born and
raised in his World State

255
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,904
where Bernard had.

256
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:12,870
The only thing that made
John different is that he

257
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,271
spent so much time on the reservation

258
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:16,345
where everyone's different.

259
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:22,224
They value individuality.

260
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:28,311
- You had some good ideas,
just to kind of wrap up

261
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,871
with that last question.

262
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:31,182
Something to think about also,

263
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:32,902
you guys kind of hit it on this,

264
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:36,983
essentially what we have
is two characters in

265
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:40,751
Bernard and John that both do not fit

266
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,731
into their communities.

267
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:43,571
Right?

268
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,231
And the world is saying
everything is designed

269
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,390
to fit exactly, and if you don't fit,

270
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,590
then you're removed from that situation.

271
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,590
And, the Savage Reservation, you are

272
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,070
basically shamed out of that group.

273
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,831
Now, that's the way John,
he's trying to interact

274
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:01,451
but because of his mother
and because of his birth,

275
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:03,181
he is shamed out of it.

276
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:06,151
But notice whenever John
goes to the World State,

277
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:09,030
and Bernard takes him and becomes
a celebrity because of it.

278
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,510
All the sudden, Bernard is very happy

279
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,831
to be part of the World State.

280
00:13:13,831 --> 00:13:17,063
So, once Bernard can actually conform

281
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:21,511
and gain advantage from
that type of society,

282
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,531
he's more than happy to continue on in it.

283
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:27,182
John, though, being the way he is,

284
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,424
he's never had the opportunity to

285
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:31,911
conform to any kind of society

286
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,712
and he still has that
shame culture inside of him

287
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,231
that he continues to
live by the whole time

288
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:39,591
he's in the World State, right?

289
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,311
So, that's something to think about too,

290
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,662
is not only are they
isolated when they are born

291
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:44,703
and different.

292
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:47,583
Then what happens, when all the sudden,

293
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,463
one of them can conform

294
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:53,265
and can be a valued
member of that society,

295
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,831
which John sort of is,

296
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:59,351
but it's more for him being
strange and weird and exotic,

297
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:03,720
then it is him being a person
and being brought into it.

298
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,271
Guys, that was a great first half.

299
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:09,461
What I need you guys to
do in the center circle is

300
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:12,423
go ahead and log in to your computers.

301
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:15,863
Outside circle people,
jot down any last minute

302
00:14:15,863 --> 00:14:18,663
ideas you want on your paper responses.

303
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:22,632
And then in just a minute, we'll switch.

304
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:31,001
(quiet talking)

305
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:44,905
- So, now we're taking notes,

306
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:47,711
as well as having the
competition on there?

307
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:51,231
- Correct, and did that
go ok for outside folks?

308
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,551
- Yeah.

309
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,145
- It was ok to do both?

310
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:55,151
- We can still take notes while we're

311
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,790
on the inner circle, right?

312
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,881
- Oh, sure, absolutely.
