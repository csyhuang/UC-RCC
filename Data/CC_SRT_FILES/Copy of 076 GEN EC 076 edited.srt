1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,303
- [Teacher] Most friends have
finished their first trials.

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:04,299
I wanted to talk real
quick about what's happened

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,659
on your first trial.

4
00:00:05,659 --> 00:00:07,517
Who wants to share

5
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:11,532
what happened on your first three trials?

6
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:14,050
And I want to know

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,945
was it something that you
predicted would happen?

8
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:23,710
Cody?

9
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:27,636
- [Cody] At first we kinda got a little,

10
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:31,496
it kind of got a little complicated.

11
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:39,376
Since you came around
it fixed it a little.

12
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:41,288
- [Teacher] Why was it complicated,

13
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:43,656
cause the rest of the group
didn't see your experiment.

14
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,024
Why was it complicated?

15
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:47,742
- [Cody] Because it keep turning

16
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:49,956
and the wax paper was--
- [Teacher] What kept turning?

17
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:50,629
- [Cody] The car

18
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,701
- [Teacher] Your car kept turning?

19
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:56,281
- [Cody] Yeah and the wax paper 
kept coming off and turning it.

20
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:58,699
So it was a little complicated.

21
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:00,023
- [Teacher] So after you got it fixed,

22
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:03,057
and after I helped you
then what did you find out?

23
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:06,849
- [Cody] That it was kind of easy to do.

24
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,775
- [Teacher] So did your measurement,

25
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:12,193
did that end up being what you
predicted it was going to be?

26
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:13,835
When it closed did you think
the car was going to travel

27
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:15,247
that far or did you think it was gonna

28
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:16,735
go a shorter distance?

29
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:18,964
- [Cody] We thought it was gonna--

30
00:01:18,964 --> 00:01:22,214
I thought it was gonna go very far.

31
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:24,374
Because that's a little bit slicker.

32
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:26,185
- [Teacher] Because that it's slippery.

33
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:29,900
Well I was listening to another
group talk about something,

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,685
I think it was at Bhavana's group,

35
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:36,495
raise your hand if you're
in Bhavana's group.

36
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:39,466
And really deep had
really good observation.

37
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,704
Because they were thinking that

38
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:43,403
it was gonna go a little bit farther too.

39
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:47,591
But you told me something
about the surface

40
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,822
that we were testing on.

41
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,424
- [Girl] I said the...

42
00:01:52,934 --> 00:01:56,114
the wax paper was a little bit smooth

43
00:01:56,114 --> 00:02:00,549
and the carpet was a little bit rough.

44
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,988
- [Teacher] So do you guys agree that

45
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:04,566
the wax paper being smooth

46
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:07,189
and the carpet that we're
testing on being rough,

47
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:09,023
if you agree that that has anything to do

48
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,718
with how far the car's going to travel,

49
00:02:10,718 --> 00:02:12,483
give me a thumb's up.

50
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:15,521
I think that makes a difference.

51
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:19,947
Lucy, why do you think
it makes a difference?

52
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:33,017
- [Lucy] The carpet, there's a 
feel of bumps if you could feel it,

53
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:38,883
and the wax paper is slippery.

54
00:02:39,928 --> 00:02:42,514
So that's how it makes the difference

55
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:46,253
cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast,

56
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,760
like if they have wheels or something,

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,641
it makes stuff fast.

58
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,733
- [Teacher] That's true.

59
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,849
So as we get ready for our next test,

60
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,398
you probably only will have
time to do maybe one trial.

61
00:02:57,398 --> 00:02:58,767
But I want you to predict,

62
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:03,157
now that you've kind of
explored the wax paper

63
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,362
and you know how far the car will travel,

64
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:08,450
looking at your information,
your measurements,

65
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,673
I want you to talk with your group about

66
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,231
how far you think the car
will go on the bumpy surface.

67
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:17,107
And we're choosing to use
the shelf liner today.

68
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:19,775
The black shelf liner in your tub.

69
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:22,520
Do you think the car's going to go farther

70
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,711
or a shorter distance
than what you measured

71
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,595
on your first trial?

72
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,815
We may only get through one trial.

73
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:32,798
And that is okay.

74
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,167
Alright but I want you to talk about it

75
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:37,264
with your groups first and then start.

76
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:39,763
So Lawson what are you gonna do first

77
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,155
before you test?

78
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,800
- [Lawson] Get in a group meeting
and sit down and meet

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,658
- [Teacher] Yeah and talk
about your predictions first.

80
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:49,097
That's what good scientists do.

81
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,715
They're always making
really good predictions

82
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,389
about what they've observed.

83
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,503
Alright. Go.

84
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:02,503
(Background Chatter)

85
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,063
- [Teacher] I'm setting the timer.

86
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:19,950
- [Lawson] I think it will go really bumpy,

87
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,500
well not really bumpy but a little bumpy.

88
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,502
And it might go just a
little less than the smooth.

89
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:35,155
- [Girl] I think that it will go
slower because the surface

90
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,265
it's really bumpy and one time

91
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,726
I went on this bumpy slide

92
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,250
and I did not go down very quickly.

93
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,250
(Background Chatter)

94
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:49,129
- [Teacher] Don't worry about
recording the information

95
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,743
right now but we'll
record in a little bit.

96
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:53,007
- [Voiceover 1] I think they're
gonna go a little bit far.

97
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,836
- [Voiceover 2] I bet slower.

98
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:58,153
- [Boy] Hey, you can't pick off of me!

99
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:04,568
- [Girl] I think that it's gonna
go farther and faster.

100
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:07,679
- [Girl in Glasses] I think it's gonna
go a little bit farther

101
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,280
and a little bit faster.

102
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,588
- [Boy] I think it's gonna
go a little bit slower.

103
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:15,711
- [Girl in white] I think it's 
kind of gonna go,

104
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:19,264
since it's bumpy it's gonna slow it down.

105
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:23,275
- [Boy in blue] I think it was gonna go farther.

106
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:29,909
- [Voiceover] Group meeting's over!

107
00:05:30,489 --> 00:05:35,489
(Background Chatter)

108
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,061
- [Teacher] So you think it's gonna go faster

109
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,308
than it did on the wax paper?

110
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:44,634
- [Mary] No I think it's going
a little bit slower

111
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:47,884
but still a little fast, like medium.

112
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,997
- [Teacher] So you don't think
it's gonna change that much,

113
00:05:49,997 --> 00:05:52,319
why do you think that?

114
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:56,038
- [Mary] Cause it doesn't feel too too bumpy.

115
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,548
- [Teacher] It doesn't feel too too bumpy,

116
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:58,964
she's making a really good observation.

117
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:00,659
What do you think Jaylin?

118
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,938
- [Jaylin] My predict is 
when you put the car on it

119
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:06,773
it's gonna kinda go medium,

120
00:06:06,773 --> 00:06:09,861
it might go a little bit
slower and a little bit fast,

121
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:14,365
and then when it gets to the
carpet it's gonna go slower

122
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,422
and then it's gonna turn.

123
00:06:16,422 --> 00:06:17,536
- [Teacher] It's gonna go a lot slower

124
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:19,914
and then it's going to turn?

125
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:22,027
- [Mary] I think like that fast.

126
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:23,993
- [Teacher] Okay.

127
00:06:23,993 --> 00:06:26,085
- [Mary] Not too fast, not as
fast as the wax paper

128
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,950
- [Teacher] Go ahead and test

129
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,365
but let's think about your setup here.

130
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,661
Before you move this,
let's look at your setup.

131
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,159
As the car rolls, what would happen maybe

132
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:38,280
if it stays in motion until
it gets to that green rug?

133
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,256
What might happen?

134
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,540
- [Olivia] It might get stopped.

135
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,036
- [Teacher] Remember the
car's going to continue

136
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:47,870
to move until something makes it stop.

137
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,728
So what might you want
to do with your ramp?

138
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:54,289
- [Mary] We might want it to 
be here so it will go straighter?

139
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,637
- [Olivia] But it might bump 
into the black box.

140
00:06:57,637 --> 00:06:59,379
- [Teacher] It may, well you
know the rug is going to--

141
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,486
- [Mary] I don't mean there, but I mean...

142
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:05,347
- [Jaylin] I know what we could do,

143
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:08,817
we could do it this way so it won't crash.

144
00:07:08,817 --> 00:07:09,828
- [Teacher] Well you
could either move it over

145
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:13,534
just a little bit so that
it has nothing in its way.

146
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:21,785
- [Olivia] Javier could you go get us some tape?

147
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:25,290
- [Teacher] It may not even need tape

148
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,760
it might cling to it without the tape.

149
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,221
Try it and see.

150
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:31,567
- [Olivia] Let's try it without some.

151
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,772
- [Mary] Yeah it doesn't even need tape.

152
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:34,329
- [Teacher] Who's the task manager here?

153
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,003
- [Girl] Me

154
00:07:35,003 --> 00:07:36,954
- [Teacher] Look out he's
doing the first test.

155
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,160
- [Girl] I think it should be Jaylin.

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,459
- [Teacher] Okay, Jaylin
now do you test sideways,

157
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,884
we talked about this yesterday
when you wouldn't agree.

158
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:45,442
And you guys talked about

159
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,846
that if some friends tested sideways

160
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:49,075
and some friends teted behind the ramp

161
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:51,515
that it may make a difference.

162
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,724
Then you guys said you
wanted to keep it the same.

163
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:00,168
- [Girl] Javier can
you move out of the way?

164
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,061
- [Jaylin] You ready?

165
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:05,272
- [Teacher] Now wait a
minute, wait a minute.

166
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:07,639
Cause I bet you probably got his on tape.

167
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,224
Jaylin show me how you did that again,

168
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,891
go get the car.

169
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,738
Watch what he did with his popsicle stick.

170
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,990
Cause I hadn't seen that before.

171
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,014
Do it just like you did the first time.

172
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,362
What did he do with his popsicle stick?

173
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,681
- [Girls] He flipped it down

174
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,617
- [Teacher] Do you think
that makes a difference

175
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:33,107
in your test if he flips
it down or raises it up?

176
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,633
Why might it make a difference Olivia?

177
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:39,633
- [Olivia] Because it might, when you put it down

178
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,086
you're putting it down fast and I bet

179
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,290
it makes the car go a little bit faster.

180
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,193
And it gives it some force.

181
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,586
- [Teacher] Did it give it more force?

182
00:08:48,586 --> 00:08:52,976
So, Jaylin is this surface
the same as this surface?

183
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,701
Is this the same as this?

184
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,512
- [Jaylin] Yes, I think

185
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:01,392
- [Teacher] Is this popsicle stick
the same as this here?

186
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,227
- [Jaylin] No.

187
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:06,002
- [Teacher] So if you test the car on this and this

188
00:09:06,002 --> 00:09:09,420
is that going to be the same as
testing it on something bumpy?

189
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,084
- [Jaylin] No.

190
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,586
- [Teacher] So what do you need to
do with the popsicle stick?

191
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:14,660
- [Jaylin] Raise it up.

192
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,634
- [Teacher] You might want
to raise it up next time.

193
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:19,260
Alright? Try it again.

194
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:21,231
I'll come back and see

195
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,197
if you guys are ready.

196
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:28,618
- [Kids] One, two, and go!

197
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:32,759
- [Mary] Wow that was great!

198
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,260
- [Voiceover] Now let's start measuring

199
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,053
- [Voiceover] Now we're
gonna start measuring.

200
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:38,816
- [Jaylin] Okay

201
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:43,520
(Background Chatter)

202
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:48,986
- [Voiceover] Okay, one, two...

203
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,360
- [Girl] No, Tessa's gotta do that.

204
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,468
- [Voiceover] One, two three ready.

205
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,980
- [Lucy] Oh my gosh we were right.

206
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,317
(Background Chatter)

207
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,992
(Laughter)

208
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:07,087
- [Boy in plaid] Our first prediction is

209
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:09,723
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

210
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:11,493
(Laughter)

211
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,420
- [Voiceover 1] It's eight!

212
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:15,510
- [Voiceover 2] Oh my gosh!

213
00:10:15,632 --> 00:10:17,135
- [Voiceover 3] Why's it eight?

214
00:10:17,489 --> 00:10:21,686
(Background Chatter)

215
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,168
- [Voiceover 1] And ours
keeps getting a mess up!

216
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,120
- [Voiceover 2] I predicted eight, too, see?

217
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,246
- [Voiceover 3] I predicted seven mostly.

218
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,193
- [Boy in plaid] We got eight cubes on this one

219
00:10:49,193 --> 00:10:50,563
- [Teacher] Eight cubes, really?

220
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:53,698
Before we clean up I would
like for you to have a quick

221
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:57,028
group meeting about what you learned

222
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,629
about the different surfaces so far.

223
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,207
Quickly sit down with your group

224
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:02,577
and have a quick group meeting.

225
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,271
I'm gonna come around and be watching.

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,757
Quick, quick, quick!

227
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:07,431
It's almost time for us to go.

228
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,600
- [Voiceover] About what you learned?

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,436
- [Teacher] What you learned today

230
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,919
about the wax paper and the bumpy surface

231
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:15,608
that you used, the shelf liner.

232
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:19,718
What did you learn from what you tested?

233
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:24,443
- [Girl] I learned that the
bumpy surface made it go,

234
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:28,414
that bumpy makes things go slower

235
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:31,155
and that smooth makes things go faster.

236
00:11:31,155 --> 00:11:32,292
- [Teacher] How do you know that?

237
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,169
- [Girl] Because when we use the
smooth it went further

238
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,447
- [Teacher] How far did it go?

239
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,233
- [Girl] It went about-- 
- [Other kids] eight cubes.

240
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:40,976
- [Girl] No

241
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:45,134
- [Boy in plaid] I think
it actually went seven.

242
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:47,893
I don't know we didn't
put the lines behind it.

243
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:52,893
- [Girl] 36 about further than this

244
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:57,065
because it went 36 or so and

245
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,154
this only went eight cubes.

246
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:04,154
So that makes it the point
where bumpy is slower.

247
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:08,279
- [Teacher] So 35 on the wax
and only eight on the bumpy?

248
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,114
The shelf liner?

249
00:12:10,114 --> 00:12:11,135
- [Boy in plaid] I think it
was seven on the bumpy.

250
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,831
- [Teacher] Big difference isn't it?

251
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,549
Is that what you predicted?

252
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,429
- [Lawson] No I didn't predict eight

253
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,497
- [Voiceover] I predicted 16

254
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:21,446
- [Lawson] No I didn't predict on the bumpy,

255
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:23,729
but I predicted...

256
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:29,379
I predicted one

257
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:33,579
and I got the right
answer for it on smooth.

258
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,372
- [Teacher] Alright. Well
you guys have two more

259
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,944
trials to do so we'll see
if your numbers are close

260
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:41,070
when you use trial two and three.

261
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,183
Alright? Go ahead and get cleaned up.

262
00:12:43,183 --> 00:12:45,028
- [Voiceover] We already
cleaned most of them first

263
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,327
- [Teacher] Well no you need
to clean all your things up

264
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,371
everything back in your tub.

265
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,415
You can go ahead and record your data

266
00:12:50,415 --> 00:12:51,598
but we're gonna get cleaned up.

267
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:52,783
Go ahead and get cleaned up.

268
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:53,943
- [Olivia] Alright push the red button,

269
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,128
you can push the red button.

270
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,636
Mary, come over here.

271
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:58,767
Tell us what you learned.

272
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,101
- [Javier] Okay Mary, come over here.

273
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,215
- [Olivia] I learned that different surfaces

274
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:09,326
can make something different,

275
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:13,517
whatever you're testing
make it go fast and slow.

276
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,223
-[Javier] Mary what did you learn?

277
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,985
- [Mary] I learned mostly the same thing

278
00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:23,797
except when we did that,

279
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:30,757
you know how this is less
bumpy than the carpet?

280
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:34,316
It makes this go faster than the carpet,

281
00:13:34,316 --> 00:13:36,080
which makes a difference.

282
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,287
- [Javier] Yeah. Jaylin what did you learn?

283
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,934
- [Jaylin] I learned if you put the car on this

284
00:13:40,934 --> 00:13:42,907
it's gonna go a little bit faster.

285
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:45,962
If you put it on this it's gonna go

286
00:13:47,482 --> 00:13:49,362
a little bit almost fast.

287
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,764
And it's gonna stop and go slower

288
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,569
and that's why it went right there.

289
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,499
- [Javier] Okay does
anybody have anything else?

290
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:01,030
- [Olivia] Javier what did you learn?

291
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,818
- [Javier] Well I learned that

292
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:08,701
if it's smoother it's quicker.

293
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,836
But if it's a little bumpy, it's slower.

294
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:14,946
That's it.

295
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,598
- [Olivia] Alright everyone put 

296
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:19,865
your things in the bucket.

297
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:24,279
