1
00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:02,898
- Where do I have more potential energy,

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:06,169
at position A, or position B, Matt?

3
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:07,002
- [Matt] Position A.

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,206
- Why?

5
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,191
- [Matt] Because it's fully
stopped before it's there,

6
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,614
it's already moving a little bit.

7
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:12,896
- What else?

8
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:15,509
Why does this point here, point A,

9
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,010
have more potential energy than point B?

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,891
So this is A, this is B.

11
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:22,034
Does everyone agree that

12
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:24,117
position A has more potential energy?

13
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:27,857
Raise your hand if you agree with that.

14
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:28,908
Okay.

15
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:31,170
Now who can tell me why, why does position A

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,926
have more potential
energy than position B?

17
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,073
- [Voiceover] It has
more potential to do work.

18
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:39,573
- Why, has potential to do work, yes, why?

19
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:42,932
- [Voiceover] It has a greater height.

20
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:45,091
- It has a greater height.

21
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,069
Who mentioned gravitational
potential energy

22
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:48,825
at the beginning of the class?

23
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:49,736
- [Voiceover] I did.

24
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:52,571
- Okay, so going back to GPE.

25
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:55,583
When you have a pendulum
swinging back and forth,

26
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:59,833
types of energy that are
involved are kinetic energy,

27
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:02,758
and potential energy,
specifically. We can say that

28
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:05,751
the potential energy is
representing gravitational

29
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,168
potential energy.

30
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:11,706
If you

31
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:14,995
focus your attention here.

32
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:20,765
What is that?

33
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:22,642
- [Voiceover] A pendulum?
- [Teacher] A pendulum.

34
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:25,142
Similar to what you have here.

35
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:29,240
Actually, you guys within the next week,

36
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,295
you'll actually be working
with the simulation,

37
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:33,892
it's effect simulation, they're online.

38
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:35,895
They're free for you to use and they're

39
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,903
nice because they allow you to play.

40
00:01:37,903 --> 00:01:39,505
I know you like to a play a lot.

41
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:40,429
- [Voiceover] I like to play.

42
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:44,262
- [Teacher] Yes, Matt. (laughs)

43
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,328
You will be working with
this, but I just wanted

44
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:49,901
to show you another application of this,

45
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,219
just in a different format.

46
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:54,469
When we swing the pendulum

47
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,749
what's going to happen?

48
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:00,173
- [Voiceover] It's gonna move.

49
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:03,739
- [Teacher] It's going to move and at

50
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:04,572
point

51
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:06,728
here.

52
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,511
And here, let's say A and B,

53
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,373
what type of energy is being represented?

54
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:15,101
- Potential.
- [Teacher] Potential energy.

55
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,041
Who can tell me where kinetic energy

56
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,245
is going to be represented?

57
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,503
You wanna come up?

58
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,086
- [Voiceover] Sure.

59
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,282
Between A and B.

60
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,666
- So every place along
the path between A and B.

61
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,206
Does everyone agree with Ali?

62
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,039
- [Class] Yes.

63
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,039
- Yes, okay.

64
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,214
Where is

65
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:44,556
gravitational potential energy at its max?

66
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,518
Wanna go up and point?

67
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,599
- At points A and B.

68
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,883
- Right, so everyone
agree on the two ends?

69
00:02:56,883 --> 00:03:00,300
Where would kinetic energy be at its max?

70
00:03:08,024 --> 00:03:10,941
Where is kinetic energy at its max?

71
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,036
- Right here.

72
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:13,977
- Why?

73
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:15,810
- Because it's lowest.

74
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:18,227
- What else?

75
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:22,361
So we said here, let's label this point C,

76
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,957
we already used A and B.

77
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:26,484
Why is kinetic energy at its maximum value

78
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:28,067
at this point here?

79
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:30,999
- [Voiceover] That's when the potential

80
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,162
energy is at its lowest.

81
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:33,564
- Great, that's where potential energy,

82
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:36,611
the gravitational potential
energy, is at its lowest.

83
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,904
And if you remember or can
recall the kinetic energy

84
00:03:38,904 --> 00:03:41,987
formula, what does the formula state?

85
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:45,095
What variables involved in the kinetic

86
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:46,703
energy formula, Matt?

87
00:03:46,703 --> 00:03:47,774
- [Matt] Mass and velocity.

88
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:49,536
- Mass and velocity.

89
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:52,875
What can you infer about
the velocity of the pendulum

90
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,878
as it's swinging along
its path back and forth,

91
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:56,878
from A to B?

92
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:01,775
What can we infer about
the kinetic energy?

93
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:05,942
- [Student] It's terminal
velocity is (mumbling).

94
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:09,606
- Well, we're not gonna
say terminal velocity,

95
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:13,708
the object isn't falling, it's attached.

96
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,999
What can we conclude about the velocity

97
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,082
at point C, any thoughts?

98
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,424
Garrett?
- [Garrett] Greatest.

99
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:23,174
- [Teacher] It's at its greatest.

100
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,976
When the pendulum is at this point,

101
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,443
it stops at each point A
and B, our two end points,

102
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:34,610
it stops for a split second
because it has to do what?

103
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,254
Maddy, did you say it?

104
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:39,087
- [Maddy] Turn around.

105
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:41,094
- It has to turn around.

106
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,158
When it swings back down,

107
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,353
what's happening to the velocity?

108
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,247
Is it increasing or decreasing?

109
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,121
Increasing, so if the
velocity is increasing,

110
00:04:51,121 --> 00:04:54,274
what's gonna happen to
the kinetic energy value?

111
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:57,109
It's also going to increase.

112
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:57,942
Now, if

113
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:02,340
I show you

114
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:07,764
a graphical representation.

115
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:10,753
Who can describe the
graphical representation?

116
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,845
- [Student] Like a downward (mumbling).

117
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,678
- Okay.

118
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:18,017
Ali?

119
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,878
- As it moves I guess it
swings back and forth,

120
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:24,343
the kinetic energy when it
reaches the middle point,

121
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:28,565
it's the highest and then
when it reaches points A and B

122
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:31,348
the potential energy gets highest.

123
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:32,515
- So does this

124
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:36,977
simulation validate the thoughts and ideas

125
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:38,915
you just came up with?

126
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:39,786
- [Students] Yes.

127
00:05:39,786 --> 00:05:43,292
- Yes and we see that
through the representation

128
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:45,665
of the graphical information
of your potential

129
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,342
energy and kinetic energy.

130
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:50,538
I can stop it at certain areas.

131
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:54,038
Sometimes it comes out better than others.

132
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:58,153
It is somewhat on its way back,

133
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:00,849
but just note that the kinetic energy is

134
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,742
lower than the potential energy.

135
00:06:03,742 --> 00:06:05,449
And if I'm really good I can maybe try

136
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,532
and get it in the middle.

137
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:13,890
Close enough, it's hard to
stop it right in the center.

138
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,632
But you notice that the
potential energy does what?

139
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:19,064
(several students speaking)

140
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,597
Decreases and your kinetic energy will?

141
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:22,619
- [Students] Increase.

142
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,235
- Increase rather.

143
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:26,457
And you said that the
kinetic energy will be

144
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:29,034
at its max at point C.

145
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:32,394
One other factor that's involved here.

146
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:35,597
There is one other type of
energy or form of energy

147
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:38,930
that's involved, can anyone think of it?

148
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:50,572
Celini?

149
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:51,664
- [Voiceover] Thermal.

150
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:53,603
- Thermal energy.

151
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:54,749
- [Voiceover] Mechanical?

152
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,478
- Mechanical.

153
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,694
- [Voiceover] Thermal.
- [Teacher] Thermal.

154
00:06:58,694 --> 00:06:59,974
Garrett, you had your hand up.

155
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:03,158
- [Garrett] Thermal.
- [Teacher] Thermal.

156
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:06,625
Who agrees with thermal? Raise your hand.

157
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,042
- [Student] Wait, actually no.

158
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,600
- Is there thermal energy involved

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,336
in the motion of a pendulum?

160
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:16,753
- [Voiceover] No.

161
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,868
- That's mechanical.

162
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,481
Thermal.

163
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,673
If you're saying thermal
energy, what form of

164
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:37,840
thermal energy is represented
here with the pendulum?

165
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:47,415
What is the pendulum doing right now?

166
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:48,926
It's moving through the?
- Air.

167
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:49,759
- Air.

168
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,974
When objects move through the air,

169
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,224
what can occur?

170
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,025
Or what is present?

171
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:02,967
Air resistance, which is a form of?

172
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:04,920
- [Student] Friction.
- [Teacher] Friction.

173
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,356
Is or is not friction an
example of heat energy?

174
00:08:08,356 --> 00:08:09,189
- [Student] Is.

175
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,875
- Or thermal energy?

176
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,793
Yes, so is it possible for us to have

177
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,787
some thermal energy present?

178
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,489
- [Students] Yes.
- [Teacher] Yes.

179
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:21,223
Now how come it's not
showing up on the graph?

180
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,350
- [Student] There's no friction.

181
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,364
- There's no friction.

182
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:26,134
So what I like about
this, and like I said,

183
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:28,607
you guys will be using the simulation.

184
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,575
And one of the options you have is to

185
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,782
change the value for friction.

186
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,539
Right now I have no friction so it's not

187
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,676
showing up on the grid.

188
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:39,526
So if I increase the friction you're going

189
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:43,447
to see how the value for
thermal energy will change.

190
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:47,346
Also, when you apply or
work with the simulation,

191
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:50,298
you can actually change
the mass of the ball,

192
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:54,465
or the pendulum in the length
of the pendulum itself.

193
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,539
And those are factors
that you will investigate

194
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,169
and collect data on in the upcoming days.

195
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,419
So let's add some friction.

196
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:06,255
Let's go about halfway.

197
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,210
What's happening to the friction?

198
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,931
- [Voiceover] It's increasing.

199
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,629
- [Student] It's
increasing on every swing.

200
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,546
- It's increasing with every swing.

201
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:26,648
- [Voiceover] And the
pendulum is not reaching

202
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:28,664
points A and B anymore.

203
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:29,711
- And the what?

204
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,728
- [Voiceover] It's not
reaching points A and B anymore.

205
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:34,169
- Why, what's happening
here, we have all these

206
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,752
types of forms of
energy, what's happening?

207
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:40,582
- [Voiceover] The air
resistance slowing it down.

208
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:44,415
- The air resistance
could be slowing it down.

209
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,968
Want a little more?

210
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,174
- [Voiceover] Falls away.

211
00:09:54,174 --> 00:09:57,841
- Lots of friction, and
what's gonna happen?

212
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,290
Ali?

213
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,172
- [Ali] Losing particles?

214
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:06,655
- It's not losing particles,
I'm not losing any mass.

215
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,008
We're not changing the mass, we're not

216
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,446
changing the particles

217
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:13,203
if there's a great deal of friction.

218
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,516
- [Voiceover] It's losing energy.

219
00:10:14,516 --> 00:10:16,157
- It slows down.

220
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,673
Does it lose energy?

221
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:19,256
(students talking)

222
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:21,406
How many of you think it loses energy?

223
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:22,739
Raise your hand.

224
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:25,355
How many of you think otherwise?

225
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:29,022
What happens to the
energy that was present?

226
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:34,308
We had colorful bars,
Matt said it's colorful.

227
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:36,874
We had colorful bars
representing kinetic energy

228
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:38,775
and potential energy.

229
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,775
Now we have these great big red bars,

230
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,908
representing thermal
energy and the total energy

231
00:10:45,908 --> 00:10:50,623
is thermal right now. What
happened in this simulation?

232
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:51,456
Ali?

233
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,946
- I don't know that, but
because in the definition of

234
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,644
thermal energy that's the
total potential or kinetic

235
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,311
energy in an object.

236
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,806
- So there is potential and
kinetic energy involved, yes.

237
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:10,388
Steven, you wanna try and help him out?

238
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:13,791
- [Steven] The energy gets
transferred to thermal?

239
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,959
- Exactly, the energy gets
transferred to thermal energy.

240
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,709
What does the word transfer mean?

241
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:25,357
Or transform, what does that mean?

242
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,758
You know the movie Transformers?

243
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:33,399
You guys are not too young for that right?

244
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,066
I had a Transformer.

245
00:11:36,302 --> 00:11:37,595
I did.

246
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,153
Jessica.
- [Jessica] It changes?

247
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:41,307
- [Teacher] It changes.

248
00:11:41,307 --> 00:11:44,814
If we were to come up
with a new concept today

249
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:49,123
explaining what happened, what
could we say that we learned

250
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:51,514
about the energies involved?

251
00:11:51,514 --> 00:11:53,158
What would be the main concept,

252
00:11:53,158 --> 00:11:55,214
the thing you just learned

253
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,131
which Steven and Jessica proceeded?

254
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,982
What happened to the energies,

255
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:07,444
who can restate what
they just stated, Matt?

256
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,777
Or maybe give a definition.

257
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:14,035
Energy is?

258
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:17,047
- [Matt] Transferred, but not lost.

259
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:20,507
- Okay, energy can be
transferred or transformed

260
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,815
and energy is not lost.

261
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:26,383
So what you learned right
now is that energy can be

262
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:29,462
transformed into other forms of energy.

263
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,511
Would you agree with that statement?

264
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,788
Raise your hand if you agree.

265
00:12:33,788 --> 00:12:37,613
And what does the word transform mean?

266
00:12:37,613 --> 00:12:38,851
- Bella?
- [Bella] Change.

267
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:40,364
- [Teacher] Good, change.

268
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:41,954
So you changed.

269
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:46,121
We began with what kind of
energy at this position?

270
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:48,666
Elaine.
- [Elaine] Potential.

271
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,747
- [Teacher] Potential.
Ailsa, it changed to?

272
00:12:50,747 --> 00:12:52,031
- [Ailsa] Kinetic.
- [Teacher] Kinetic,

273
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:53,428
it changed to?

274
00:12:53,428 --> 00:12:54,581
- [Voiceover] Potential.
- [Teacher] Potential.

275
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:56,718
Changed back to?
- Kinetic.

276
00:12:56,718 --> 00:13:00,027
- Kinetic, and we also have
some thermal energy involved.

277
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,860
Is everyone clear on that concept?

278
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:06,728
What you're going to do with your group,

279
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:11,161
get out a sheet of paper,
a piece of scrap paper.

280
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,446
Or you could use the back
of your packet is fine,

281
00:13:13,446 --> 00:13:16,131
there's a blank spot on there.

282
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:16,964
One paper.

283
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:20,513
- [Voiceover] Per group?
- [Teacher] Per group.

284
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:30,430
(students talking over each other)

285
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,249
Okay, what you're going to do.

286
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:45,588
I'm showing you two
objects, I brought in props

287
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:47,171
for you guys today.

288
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:52,522
Real life, this is my toaster from home.

289
00:13:52,522 --> 00:13:53,605
- [Class] Aw.

290
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,392
- [Voiceover] Is it a
brave little toaster?

291
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:58,642
(laughter)

292
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,698
- What I want you to do,
you have two examples.

293
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:06,889
Stand and look at the fan because

294
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,784
it is plugged in, it is turned on,

295
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,246
the blades are moving.

296
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,884
What I want you to do
to these two objects,

297
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:16,033
I want you to write
down the forms of energy

298
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,671
that you think are involved

299
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,421
with these appliances or objects,

300
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,825
but what I want you to do
is take it a step further.

301
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,603
I want you to tell me or place in order,

302
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,796
what type of energy do
you begin with and then

303
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:35,146
maybe with one to two
types of energy or forms

304
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:37,729
of energy that are transformed.

305
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,879
So you begin with, you
might have a thought,

306
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,158
what type of energy do
I begin with in order

307
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:48,527
for the toaster to work?
What type of energy

308
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:52,425
did the fan begin with in
order for it to turn on?

309
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,970
And I want you to list the
types of forms of energy

310
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,248
involved and then put them in
the order of transformation.

311
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:04,527
You're gonna get about two
to three minutes to do this.

312
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:08,748
I would like every person
in the group to participate.

313
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:12,601
You all should be able to
share your ideas freely.

314
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,790
Respect what other people are saying,

315
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,204
and then come to a consensus
and write down your idea

316
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:20,172
and your energies.

317
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:22,755
Any questions before you begin?

318
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,121
Any questions?

319
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:27,390
Okay.

320
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:51,557
(students talking with one another)

321
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:57,883
- See, it like stops here (mumbling).

322
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:05,553
Like that's potential energy and (mumbling).

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:26,000
(students talking all at once)

324
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,248
- Well, if you look at the fan,

325
00:16:30,248 --> 00:16:32,154
I purposely turned it on.

326
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,571
So the blades are doing what?

327
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,714
They're moving. Are they doing work?

328
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:39,547
Yes.

329
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,447
Base your forms or types of energy

330
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:45,780
on what you see.

331
00:16:48,366 --> 00:16:51,949
The blades are moving,
it is turning, okay?

332
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,437
If you want to list the
energy you begin with,

333
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,849
put an arrow, put the next
form of energy, put an arrow.

334
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,873
Put the next form of energy
to show the consecutive

335
00:17:08,873 --> 00:17:12,220
transformations of your
energy that's involved

336
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,970
with the two objects.

337
00:17:32,023 --> 00:17:34,023
Is it turning right now?

338
00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:41,153
Do you all agree on that?

339
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:46,585
I would spend a little time
sharing some ideas about that.

340
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:52,521
- Wait, wait, wouldn't they both be

341
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,219
nuclear energy?

342
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:56,450
- Nuclear energy?

343
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,576
- Yes, because it's (mumbling).

344
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:04,579
- Think about your
definition of (mumbling).

345
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:07,369
- [Voiceover] Here you put
the energy for toaster.

346
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:37,286
(students talking all at once)

347
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:40,846
I would write it down.

348
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:41,679
Sucked in.

349
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:44,851
I don't have the jolt in that, look.

350
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,851
I don't have the toaster plugged in.

351
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:10,000
(background chatter)

352
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,530
Don't burn yourself.

353
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,780
But let's look and observe.

354
00:19:16,631 --> 00:19:19,782
Three of you, do you feel anything?

355
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:22,276
- Yes, do you see all those
little black pointy things,

356
00:19:22,276 --> 00:19:25,517
when you put something in
there and you turn it on?

357
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:27,891
I don't know what you call
those things, but they like...

358
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:28,724
- The coil?

359
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:30,345
- Yeah, the coil, yeah.

360
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,093
- (mumbling)

361
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:33,679
- Yes, they do!

362
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,893
That's how you generate the heat.

363
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:38,875
- If you had the toast it would turn on.

364
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,031
- How about in the oven, coils inside,

365
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,641
what colors do they turn?

366
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,474
- Orange.

367
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:46,123
They turn orange, the same thing.

368
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:47,757
- They turn orange?

369
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:51,156
So do you think that there's a
form of energy involved here?

370
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,107
- [Girls] Yeah.

371
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:54,385
- Magnetic.

372
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:55,821
That's right?

373
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:56,654
- Oh!

374
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,958
- But you discovered it on your own.
