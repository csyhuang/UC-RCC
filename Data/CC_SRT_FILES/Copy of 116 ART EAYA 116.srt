1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,860
- [Instructor] In my classroom, each
student has their own individual workbench

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,480
with a set of hand tools in the drawers,
where they also may store their art and

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,450
they've each made a back splash of art
inspirational images. In the corner of the

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,630
room, I have a resource area including
images of art, books and magazines, a

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,040
computer with an internet connection, and
examples. I have a board where I give

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,890
notes and it has a calendar with the semester
at a glance. I have a demo table where we

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,200
meet for discussions and group
demonstrations. In the corner of the room,

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,730
there's acid etching done safely with
rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:48,830
apron. In front of that there's soldering
with a acetylene tanks chained to the

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:55,060
cabinet and a good ventilation system above, and
also, eye protection and gloves. The sink

11
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,620
area includes an emergency eyewash station
and soaps. In the corner of the room, you

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,110
see a fire extinguisher, a buffing
machine, a hammering area done safely with

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,740
a stump to limit the percussive nature of
each blow, and ear protection, a drill

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,900
press done safely with eye protection and
gloves, an emergency eyewash station and

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,810
shower, and first aid kit. In here, we
have an enamelling area above banks of

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:32,700
labeled cabinets with ventilation. And in
the front, we have a bulletin board with

17
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
notices and class rules and another fire
extinguisher.

18
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,230
This is another reason why people might
own jewelry or want to have jewelry. Now this isn't

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,080
jewelry per se You know what these are?

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,010
- Coins?

21
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,080
- Coins. There's such an interesting
iconography of coins. I love the

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:59,330
patterning that happened when he cast
them. I mean, I just think its... You've got the

23
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,270
horse. You've got the man. Some sort of a
symbol. I don't really know what all the

24
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,380
symbols are, but you could really use a
lot of this. And do research symbols like

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,360
for the production project that is coming
up. And here people have even made jewelry

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,030
out of the coins. And here art is an
example of, in north Africa, a lot of

27
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,080
times women, traditional women, it's
probably changing now, but I don't really

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,870
know how much it's changed or not changed.
This picture is from 1988 or something, so

29
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:35,410
it's in the past. But they would get a lot
of their wealth from their family given to

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,850
them as jewelry. And they'd wear it
everyday. And it might seem ridiculous to

31
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,890
us, you can do your farming, you're going
about your business, cooking and you're

32
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,890
wearing all that craziness, but that way
it's on them, they have it, if something

33
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,890
happens to their husband, nobody can take
it away because it's on their body. It's

34
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,940
protected. It's also very obvious. If the
husband were to steal the money, and take

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,950
it away, they would know because she's not
wearing it. So he would be shamed. So it's

36
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,150
sort of... it's like the dowry, the money
comes into the family from the woman's

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:11,330
parents, but it's also to help protect the
woman. It's not just... it's not just to go

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,000
to the husband. So I think it's amusing
that they're wearing it.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,910
- I thought they weren't allowed to wear
makeup.

40
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,940
- Well, it depends in what part of-- where
you are. I mean, are you thinking who is

41
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,613
they?

42
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:24,684
- I'm thinking Iran and stuff, and north
Africa.

43
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:31,540
- Right. Iran, there's different sects of
Islam and what people believe as really

44
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:39,630
strict is different. In this, north
Africa... Iran's more in the Middle East,

45
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,090
getting closer... I mean, does it
even... even in Asia, it might even be

46
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:44,310
Asia.

47
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,890
- No, it's not in north Africa.

48
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,330
- It's not in Africa. So this is
like... north Africa, there's a lot of

49
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,200
tribal groups that were nomads in the
desert. It's all intermixed. And people in

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,716
southern Africa, like in Sudan are
predominantly Islamic and they have a

51
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:03,620
different take on it, too. So maybe in
Iran it's frowned upon as vanity, but...

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:10,180
- The Muslim culture requires women to
cover their faces. It's not Muslim

53
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,920
religions that only...
- It's Arabian.

54
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,020
- That's very good, Chloe. Very, very
astute.

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,700
- It's there traditions. It's not required by the
religion, it's a cultural thing.

56
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,630
- That's good. That's a good
clarification. I didn't think of it that

57
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,670
way. So also, this redeemable investment
or wealth, people like to and they have

58
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,680
people over for dinner.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,440
- Golden silverware?

60
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,950
- On the right, that was the silverware of
Marie Antoinette.

61
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,560
- I've never heard of gold silverware.

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,380
- So gold, I know, they're eating on gold.
And it can't be 24 carat, because it would

63
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,450
be too soft. But it's probably a gold
alloy. And there's also cases of people

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,000
when times get tough, melting down their
silverware.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,340
- So they can have the...

66
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,770
- Yeah, and you use that as your... it's
like people nowadays are investing in

67
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,500
gold. They're buying gold bars, because
it's like you own something. You see it.

68
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,390
It's not just a piece of paper that says
you own something.

69
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,430
- Yeah, I think there's commercials
about buying gold.

70
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,560
- And this is a chalice through the
church. The church accumulated a lot of

71
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,730
wealth, specifically, the Catholic church
during the Medieval times. And they would

72
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,190
have it made into these things like the
chalice for the blood. Okay, attraction

73
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,770
and beauty. This is pretty obvious,
because where do people usually wear

74
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,450
jewelry?

75
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,720
- On their necks and faces and...

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,590
- Yeah, yeah, to draw attention, I think,
to the face usually is a big deal. And

77
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:43,590
also, this is an example of a Cartier
necklace that was a gift from a man to a

78
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:51,220
woman. So a lot of times, it's with the
idea of love, or commitment, romantic

79
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:59,370
love. Here we have Indians from India, and
these are things that you can buy. This is

80
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,660
just off of that. So this is like the
traditional wedding where you've got kind

81
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,440
of an inexpensive version, perhaps, that
you can buy. There's all sorts... there's

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,577
all levels of expense that you can buy.
And here we are again with north Africa.

83
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:16,265
Just kind of thinking about the different
ideas of what is beautiful and what isn't

84
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:21,210
beautiful. I don't know. How many of you
have tattoos? Any of you have a tattoo?

85
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,190
- I wish.

86
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,140
- Okay, I mean you're a little bit young.
Right? Do you think you might want a tattoo at

87
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,810
some point?

88
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,530
- Yeah, my friend has a whole entire
paragraph on her back.

89
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,570
- Really? Do you like it?

90
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,850
- Yeah, it's really pretty, but I wouldn't
want something like that. Yeah.

91
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,700
- I don't remember what it says...
Something, it has to do with swimming, I

92
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,010
think.
- It's like swimming.

93
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,250
- In some way. It's a really good quote,
though.

94
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,330
- Yeah, she looks like that girl from
Avatar.

95
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,280
- You know, I haven't seen Avatar, but as
a movie designer, James Cameron, what do

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,780
you think he was looking at to get
inspiration for the movie?

97
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:21,000
- Probably...
[Background Chatter]

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,893
- If you, I mean, does anybody like Star
Wars? That was a popular kind of thing. But

99
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:34,380
you know, I always wanted the hair braids.
"Mom, mom, please." She's like, "Your hair

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,860
isn't long enough. That was a movie. They
had... it was a wig." I was like, "Do it.

101
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,820
Do it."

102
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,830
- I braid my hair, put beads in it
sometimes.

103
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,500
- There are cultures that wear their hair
like that. So it's like nothing is sort of

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,940
new under the sun. People are reinventing
what's already happened.

105
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,000
- I always wanted it just like Pocahontas
that's the entire story.
[Background Chatter]

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,970
- The second time I saw it, I was like,
"Oh, this is really bad." One thing, they

107
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,871
represented it wrong, that's like the reason
they were there because it was very valuable...

108
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,923
- Oh, so you're thinking it could have
been a little more creative? [Background Chatter]

109
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:26,000
[Background Chatter]

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,440
- You know, the first time you see it,
it's so good. And then the second time

111
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,460
you're like, "Hey, now that I've seen this..."

112
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,290
- So it's good to critique pop culture to
determine. If you get a job in the movies,

113
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,140
how would you do it better or differently?

114
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,502
- I'd do a different plot. I'd be more
creative.

115
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:54,191
[Background Chatter]

116
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,030
- Okay, yeah, we better... I'm gonna keep
moving on. All right? Okay, so here we

117
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:04,630
have ancient Egypt on the left and we have
Miss South Carolina 2000, I can't

118
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,890
remember, 2004, 2006, recently. Isn't it
interesting how similar the eye, the

119
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,180
eyeliner, the long eyebrow, the hair
coming down, the crown? You know, I

120
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,650
mean...
- I think the eyebrows [inaudible].

121
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:31,000
- Well, she doesn't have the...
[Background Chatter]

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,150
- I'm trying to create a bead kind of
thing.

123
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,780
- Okay.

124
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,590
- Melting the stuff Drew was using for his
corset together.

125
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:51,340
- Oh, the screen? So you're melting the
screen? Oh, interesting. So how will you

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,740
use that in your... ?

127
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:00,660
- I'm thinking I can use it in attaching,
because I think it would look cool if

128
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,530
there was something kind of like that, not
gold and shell-ish.

129
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,250
- Okay. Okay, well, do you want to go look
at your stuff? Or do you want to... or you

130
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,500
feel like you need to finish that?

131
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,521
- Oh, no, that's fine.

132
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:23,000
[Background Chatter]

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,490
- There appears to be no blue stuff.

134
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,500
- Oh, the pickle? It's new.
- Oh.

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,460
- It only gets blue from the copper, so
it, it does have pickle in it. It's just

136
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,800
fresh and new. So you could, you
could... see that little yogurt container?

137
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,240
You can put it in that, and that has holes
in it, and then you can just kind of let

138
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:53,170
that float. Just kind of put a little in
there. Like tip it. Yeah, that's good.

139
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:01,143
Okay, yeah, let's go look at your... Oh,
should we look at those? Would you rather

140
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:05,460
do those, or... Okay, let's go... [Background Chatter]
Sorry, we're going outside

141
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,210
now.

142
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,735
- Okay.

143
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:17,090
[Background noises and wind]

144
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,470
- Oh, wow. What do you think?

145
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,560
- I like them. I really like them as not a
shell color, because they don't seem...

146
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,040
- Can I touch it? Sorry, I touched it
before I asked you.

147
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,340
- I think once you like...as
I did, just find the shell along the

148
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,660
stream.

149
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,830
- Right, you're transforming it. I really
like the shell of the spray paint too,

150
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,000
because it helps tie it in with the metal.
It makes... well, it's metallic spray

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,950
paint, so it seems really metal-y, yeah.
Right. Cool. And it makes it a little bit

152
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,210
more blingy. You know?

153
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:56,970
- And I like how it reflects the light,
all the cracks, and stuff.

154
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:06,250
- Yes, it gives it a unifying presence
instead of having all that color

155
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,480
variation. Especially if you think about
having one necklace that has many shells

156
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,340
on it. Then this unifies them. It makes
them probably a little bit more wearable

157
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,690
with people's clothes. Do you think? About
how would you, how will you attach... are

158
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,000
you thinking of using these in one group?
Or are they more pendants?

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,510
- I think they're more like pendants, and
I was gonna poke a hole.

160
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,410
- Okay.

161
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,050
- Like two holes in them, and I was gonna
use a bunch of different strings together.

162
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,490
So it's kind of like. . .and they're right
there. And maybe bead it, a bunch of

163
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,660
beaded strings.

164
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,640
- So really, this is like one necklace
that's... or is it many necklaces that

165
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,941
people can layer?
- It's just one necklace.

166
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:57,700
- Okay, all right. Well let's... can we go
look at your sketch book, too? The other

167
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,270
thing is, next time it would be better, I
think, to drill the hole first before you

168
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,020
paint it.
- Okay.

169
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,147
- Because I'm afraid the paint might
scratch in the process of drilling the

170
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:08,755
hole.

171
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,730
- I was going to just poke a hole with a
needle.

172
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,090
- Can you do that?

173
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:18,880
- I think so. I mean, they're really a lot
more soft than metal.

174
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,580
- Oh, okay, well try it, and see if it
works. But I have a diamond drill bit. It

175
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,520
can drill and that's what Drew has been
using to drill his glass and stuff.

176
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,430
- Okay, and also, most of these already
have holes.

177
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,360
- Oh, yeah, because of the creature that
eats the muscle.

178
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,960
- Yeah.

179
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,920
- I love the hole that's already in there,
yeah, okay. All right, let's go look at

180
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,980
that. These probably need to dry a little
more.

181
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,710
- Yes.
- Okay, okay, let's go in.

182
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,710
- There's only five more minutes on here.

183
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,881
- Okay, that's good. We'll get this and
that'll be okay.

[Background workshop noises and chatter]

185
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,580
- Oh, look at that. See, that's amazing to
me, because whenever I find coquinas, I

186
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,610
guess I find the live coquinas. I've never
seen the shells, like just the shells. But

187
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,540
they all have a hole. This is a great
find.

188
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,530
- I got my back so sunburned gathering all
of these on the beach.

189
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,180
- Yes.

190
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,840
- Because they all lay next to each other
in the sand.

191
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,410
- And when you, I mean, now do you have
sketches of how these might be transformed

192
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,790
into jewelry?
- I'm not sure yet, because...

193
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,000
- Here, I'll come over... is this better
like this?

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,550
- Yeah.

195
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,440
- I could use like... I could put them
all together on one string, on one

196
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,040
necklace. Sort of like the coral. But I
don't know. I don't think I have enough

197
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,900
for that from reproduction.

198
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,540
- Well, you have a lot. What might be
better, right, because, you're right.

199
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,050
Because then they would nest. Right? If
you just put with cubicle, then they don't

200
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,560
take up much space. What if you made a
bunch jump rings with thin wire, and then

201
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,700
you have a little jump ring that would go
through each one. And that could put... see

202
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,990
how you have sort of charms on your chain?
You could... these could also be sort of

203
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,050
like charms hanging down, and you could
layer them maybe with a jump ring, could

204
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,520
have a little chain. And it could hang
down to vary the length or, or you said

205
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,290
that you like to use... did you make your
necklace that's woven there? That's, okay,

206
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:34,020
you, but you know how to sew? So could you
sew them on something?

207
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,090
- I could, yeah.

208
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:41,420
- I mean, I have some leather strip, and
that would be keeping with natural

209
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:48,840
materials. So that might be interesting. I
don't know. I... well, I think what you

210
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:56,680
need to do is to experiment, sew some, do
some metal through some, and then maybe

211
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,120
lay some out. And you can see how Chloe
has hers laid out in that box, so that she

212
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,930
can keep it. I think you'd need a box or a
tray, and you could sort of lay it out so

213
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,590
you can start to see the composition of
them.

214
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,433
- Yeah.
- Now what are these?

215
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:18,456
- Those are... 
- Oh, and these are a dove's feathers.

216
00:16:18,456 --> 00:16:22,488
- They're so elegant.
- Yes.

217
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:29,240
- Now do you have your sketch book? Can we
look at the sketch on how you thought you

218
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,873
might do this?

219

[Background Chatter]

220
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:48,770
- Here, I think I got it.

221
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,210
- Here you go. I could do this with the
shell.

222
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,170
- Oh, because that's hanging off. And then
what is this round ring part?

223
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,920
- I'm not sure. It could just be like a
round, golden...

224
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,590
- It could be a soldered ring of metal,
like brass, wire soldered together. Is

225
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,540
this an earring?

226
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,790
- Yes.
- Okay.

227
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,770
- That may be for these.

228
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,670
- Right.

229
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,800
- That was... that's what I was planning to
do with the shell. For that, I could do a

230
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,990
bunch of different strings, or I could
just do one string and put two of these

231
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,000
sort of up the string, or something.

232
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,170
- Right, right, asymmetry. Okay, I
like it. And then this is the feather?

233
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,000
These are jump rings and this is the feather.
