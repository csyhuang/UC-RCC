1
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:05,001
- They died because?

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:06,553
- No CO2.
- Two snails.

3
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:07,631
- So if add another plant in there

4
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:08,954
is that going to add CO2,

5
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,172
or is it going to take
away more CO2?

6
00:00:11,172 --> 00:00:15,194
- Takeaway, you could probably

7
00:00:15,194 --> 00:00:18,424
try it with the lights off.

8
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,436
- Why do you think that would work?

9
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:22,030
- Umm...

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,613
Maybe it might give them some more CO2.

11
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:29,271
- Okay, well why don't you
write down your predictions,

12
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:34,041
so she said turn the lights
off and see what happens.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,656
So did your snail coordinate
with your prediction?

14
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:38,566
- Yeah, but for long.

15
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,248
- Not for long?

16
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:44,862
All right, Haley, so
look at your prediction.

17
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:46,826
This is your setup.

18
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:49,944
Isaiah, can you go shut the door for me?

19
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:51,493
- Okay, so number E.
- Stay alive, stay alive.

20
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:54,353
- Not number, letter E.

21
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:56,370
- It lived.

22
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:58,856
- Okay, why do you think
- But is also in

23
00:00:58,856 --> 00:01:00,258
- unstable environment.

24
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:01,790
- I thought plants
needed sunlight to live.

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,125
How are they still alive,

26
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,229
and then they died when when you --

27
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:05,488
- Because there was no light?

28
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:08,022
[Background Chatter]

29
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:10,380
- It was light.
- Tell me what

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,721
- you said.

31
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,355
- I had no idea.

32
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:14,996
- Wait, never mind.

33
00:01:14,996 --> 00:01:15,731
- What do you think?

34
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:16,722
- It's a miracle.

35
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:17,872
- It's a miracle?

36
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,837
Why don't you go back to
your prior knoweldge here.

37
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,471
What did we say...

38
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:24,782
You didn't answer some of those,

39
00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:26,851
but what do you think...

40
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,445
Obviously something is
making CO2, right?

41
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,109
'Cause that started at six, right?

42
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:39,557
If we hit carbon reset, look.

43
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,664
It starts at six and six, we're even.

44
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:44,313
If I hit play, look what's happening.

45
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,776
What's happening to the CO2 level?

46
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:47,158
- It's getting bigger.

47
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:48,640
- Yeah, why is it getting bigger?

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,968
Where's that CO2 coming from?

49
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:52,766
Who's making it?

50
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:53,653
- The plants.

51
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:54,058
[gasps]

52
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:56,665
- Okay, why are they making it?

53
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:57,988
- So they can live.

54
00:01:57,988 --> 00:01:59,588
- Okay, what's that called?

55
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:01,145
Like what process is
that when they make CO2?

56
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:02,860
- Photosynthesis.

57
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,305
- Photosynthesis makes CO2?

58
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:07,376
- I guess.

59
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,562
- No.

60
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:13,090
- Isn't it cellular res-per-tation?

61
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,290
Ms. Rutala, isn't it that?

62
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,054
- Respiration.

63
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:26,344
You know how we talked about this?

64
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,811
This is photosynthesis, right?

65
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:31,910
Carbon dioxide plus
water in the sun

66
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,802
is going to make glucose
and oxygen, right?

67
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:37,408
For respiration, they're taking

68
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:41,510
that exact same glucose
and that oxygen,

69
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,987
and they're making three things.

70
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,159
They're going to make
energy to stay alive.

71
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,426
That's why those plants
are still living.

72
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,737
They're going to make...

73
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:50,846
- CO2.

74
00:02:50,846 --> 00:02:52,236
- Which is why...

75
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,249
- They're still living.

76
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:56,057
- Uh huh.  And why there's
a high number in there,

77
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,782
and they're also going to make...

78
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:00,331
- H2O, which is water.

79
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:02,357
- Does that make sense?

80
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,387
Do you see now why those numbers

81
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,954
are going up for CO2?

82
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:05,574
- Yeah.

83
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,255
- 'Cause they're going through...

84
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,348
- Photosynthesis.

85
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:09,598
- No.

86
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:12,986
- 'Cause their going
through the energy.

87
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:14,133
- CO2.

88
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:16,269
- Respiration.

89
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,383
Respiration is the process.

90
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:21,289
Do you see that?

91
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:22,606
- Yeah.

92
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:27,125
- All right, you're welcome.

93
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:30,230
All right, how are we doing here?

94
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,904
- Good.

95
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,047
- You guys are still ready

96
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,084
to predict the second part?

97
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:36,850
Okay, how are we doing here?

98
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:40,441
- We just now got to the back.

99
00:03:40,441 --> 00:03:42,725
- That's okay, you take your time.

100
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:43,910
This is good.

101
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,636
Take your time as long
as you are understanding.

102
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:47,709
That's the whole point of this.

103
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,687
Okay, so move on to this one.

104
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,415
What is a new question you have

105
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,945
or an experiment you
would want to do?

106
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,707
- The snail one.

107
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:56,829
- Well, what's the snail one?

108
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,165
What's a question you have
based on what you just did?

109
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:01,025
Are you curious about something?

110
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,398
What's a new question
or a new experiment

111
00:04:02,398 --> 00:04:03,857
you'd want to try?

112
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:07,257
- How come, well, I just
want to know why

113
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:11,053
the snail keeps dying.

114
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,335
- Okay, you can put that down.

115
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:16,388
Why does the snail keep dying?

116
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,787
Did it die in every
single situaiton though?

117
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:20,415
- No.

118
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:22,852
- Everyone we've done so far.

119
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,306
- You might want to think about why,

120
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,998
which situations it died in, right?

121
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:28,501
All right, let's see.

122
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,041
Put your head up.

123
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,659
All right, you guys are still in this one?

124
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,340
Test tube C2 has plants and snails,

125
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,558
but resulted in an
unstable environment, why?

126
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:39,142
I thought plants and snails
helped each other live.

127
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:40,759
Why did they die?

128
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,888
- Because they didn't have that much,

129
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,836
what's it called, oxygen.

130
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:48,522
- Well, when they started the test tube

131
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,688
it was at six and six.

132
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:52,133
All of them start at six, six, right?

133
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,241
So look at test tube C2.

134
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:56,091
To plants, two snails.

135
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:57,408
The lights are...

136
00:04:57,408 --> 00:04:58,464
- Off.

137
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,693
- The O2 level at the
end of the experiment is?

138
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,632
- 12, oh, oh.

139
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:03,746
- It's at what?

140
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,095
- Zero point --

141
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:07,803
- Zero point zero, which
means there is no oxygen,

142
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:10,620
so does that make sense as
to why one of these died?

143
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,112
- The snail was the one.

144
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,123
The snails died.

145
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:14,829
- Uh huh, and then the CO2 level is at?

146
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:15,448
- 12.

147
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,779
- 12, did the plants die?

148
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,130
- No.

149
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,987
- Why didn't they die but the snails died?

150
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,925
- Because the snails

151
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,671
gave off their CO2?

152
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,054
- Um hmm

153
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:27,062
And why did that keep the plants alive?

154
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,573
- Because they take in CO2?

155
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,878
- Uh huh, okay.

156
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:32,855
- But it somehow

157
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:36,003
they didn't give off O2, I guess?

158
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,418
- Why is that somehow?

159
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,700
Why weren't they able to give off O2?

160
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,597
- Because the lights weren't on?

161
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:43,811
- Uh huh, and why are
the lights so important?

162
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,212
- To produce photosynthesis?

163
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,892
- Yes, they need light for photosynthesis.

164
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,913
Remember, this is like a recipe, right?

165
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:54,797
You have to have all three ingredients

166
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,356
to make photosynthesis work.

167
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,130
You have to have carbon dioxide,

168
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,582
you have to have water,

169
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:02,261
and you have to have sunlight.

170
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,620
You can't just have one of the three.

171
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,952
You can't have two of the three.

172
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:09,112
You have to have all three.

173
00:06:09,112 --> 00:06:11,264
Do you see why that works?

174
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:13,569
Okay, good.

175
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,787
- Um hmm.
- Okay, good.

176
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:19,526
All right, how are we doing here?

177
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:20,778
- We're passing.

178
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,178
Let me ask you --

179
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:23,410
- Yeah? I did not --

180
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,461
- She was in the bathroom.

181
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:26,694
- I went to go blow my nose.

182
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:29,633
- All right, let's go
ahead and work over here.

183
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:34,949
So let's go ahead and
catchup ourselves here.

184
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:36,181
What is one new question you have

185
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:38,360
or experiment you would preform?

186
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,420
So based on what you've already done

187
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,469
is there something you are curious about?

188
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,105
I just gave you free reign.

189
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,691
Go ahead, do whatever you want.

190
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:47,634
Do you have any questions about anything?

191
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:49,202
- Yeah, E.

192
00:06:49,836 --> 00:06:51,322
- Stay here.

193
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:52,801
- Yeah, I'll stay here
while you write it down.

194
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:56,453
- Why do they have to close it up?

195
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,972
Close the test tubes up?

196
00:06:57,972 --> 00:06:59,321
- Okay, so would you be curious about

197
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:01,622
doing the experiment without closing it?

198
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:02,854
That's a good question.

199
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,244
What was your question?

200
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,501
- Every four plants and four snails.

201
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,916
Would they survive with
the lights on or off?

202
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:11,262
- What do you think?

203
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,021
- I think with the lights off

204
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:15,739
because if they have four plants,

205
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,914
they will have, I mean,

206
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,607
if they had it on, they'll
produce a lot of oxygen,

207
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,654
therefore, the snails would die,

208
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:25,909
but if you put it off,
maybe they'll produce

209
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,395
the right amount of oxygen.

210
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:30,038
- They'll produce a lot of
oxygen, the snails will die?

211
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,794
- Well, it's kind of complicated.

212
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,279
- No, I want to try it out.

213
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,002
You're saying that you think that --

214
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,924
- Because it's too much oxygen.

215
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:41,610
- Too much oxygen?

216
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,131
- In this one container, maybe?

217
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,247
- Well, who would benefit
from all that oxygen?

218
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,065
- The snails.

219
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,801
- Okay.  So we know the
snails would stay alive

220
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,565
'cause they would have what?

221
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:54,348
- Oxygen.

222
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,268
- Okay, what about the plants?

223
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,243
Do you think the plants
are going to stay alive?

224
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:57,914
- Nope.

225
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:58,394
- Why?

226
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,487
- Because they don't have
carbon dioxide, maybe.

227
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:05,288
[Background Chatter]

228
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:07,327
- How's the situation so far?

229
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:09,825
- Good.

230
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,142
- I think it's bad.

231
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,098
- Probably it won't survive because --

232
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:14,723
- So, in the light it's okay.

233
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,256
It's balanced.

234
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:18,548
One's giving, the other one's getting.

235
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,047
You got that, all right?

236
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,761
So what do you think is
going to happen at night?

237
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,682
- They're going to die, probably.

238
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:24,309
- Who's going to die?

239
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:26,970
- The snails.

240
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,675
- Why do you think the
snails are going to die?

241
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:29,978
- I don't know.

242
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:32,822
- Because it's going to
be too much CO2.

243
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:34,206
- Too much CO2?

244
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,866
Why is there going to be too much CO2?

245
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:38,626
- Because the snails

246
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:42,837
can't get O2 'cause there's no light.

247
00:08:42,837 --> 00:08:44,555
- Exactly.

248
00:08:44,555 --> 00:08:46,048
Go ahead and hit play.

249
00:08:47,288 --> 00:08:48,875
- Whoa, whoa.

250
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,175
[laughter]

251
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,642
Too much CO2.

252
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:55,009
- Did that CO2, what
did you notice about it?

253
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,885
- And the plants died.

254
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,558
- There was no oxygen.

255
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,001
- There was no oxygen,

256
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,361
but why did the plants die?

257
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:03,588
Plants don't need oxygen.

258
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,209
Plants need CO2.

259
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,165
- There was too much?

260
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:09,542
- They couldn't give off --

261
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:10,963
- It already was at the max?

262
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,221
- Reached it's max.

263
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,411
Here's my question.

264
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,560
Are the snails the only
ones making CO2?

265
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,124
Who else is making CO2?

266
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,258
- The plants?

267
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:26,384
- Do plants make CO2 at night?

268
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:33,105
How could you design a little
experiment to test that?

269
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,956
What can you do to
design an experiment

270
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:36,061
right now to test that?

271
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,854
- Take all the snails out.

272
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,854
- Okay, and what?

- Okay, let's see.

275
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,613
We want to see if plants will

276
00:09:45,613 --> 00:09:47,532
go through respiration at night.

[Background Chatter]

282
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,751
Okay, so look at your data so far.

283
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,644
What do you notice?

284
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,012
- They're producing a lot of oxygen.

285
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:06,526
- I'm following.

286
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:07,495
- Okay, so isn't that weird?

287
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:09,549
I thought plants made oxygen.

288
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,460
- I mean, they're producing
a lot of carbon dioxide.

289
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,279
- They are?

290
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,523
Why are they producing carbon dioxide?

291
00:10:17,523 --> 00:10:18,747
I thought plants made oxygen.

292
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,978
- Wasn't it through respiration?

293
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:23,378
- Okay, so they can't get sunlight,

294
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:25,215
so they're not going through...

295
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,045
- Photosynthesis.

296
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:27,935
- Photosynthesis, but
they are going through...

297
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:28,686
- Respiration.

298
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:32,734
- Respiration, so remember,
our respiration, right?

299
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:34,236
They don't have sunlight.

300
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,346
Does respiration need
sunlight to work?

301
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:38,298
- No, it needs energy.

302
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:39,025
- Nope, it doesn't.

303
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:39,913
So all they need is what?

304
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,639
- CO2.

305
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,349
- No, what does this stand for?

306
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,701
- Glucose.

307
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,702
- Right, so they need glucose and?

308
00:10:47,702 --> 00:10:49,020
- Oxygen.

309
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,706
- Was there oxygen in
there before we started.

310
00:10:50,706 --> 00:10:51,801
- No.

311
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,342
- There wasn't?

312
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:53,403
- Oh, wait, yes.

313
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,573
- There was, look.

314
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,111
- It's even.

315
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,329
- There was oxygen in there.

316
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:02,168
There was six cpms of oxygen,

317
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:04,627
so then it went through this process,

318
00:11:04,627 --> 00:11:05,769
and it made energy,

319
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,735
which kept them alive,

320
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,628
it made CO2, which you saw

321
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,444
because the CO2 levels went...

322
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:12,681
- Up.
- Up.

323
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,426
- And it also made...

324
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,210
- Water.
- H2O.

325
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,189
- Which you can't really tell.

326
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,853
- It turned yellow.

327
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:21,632
- And it's probably
still inside the cells.

328
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:22,908
Does that make sense though?

329
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:25,524
Okay, good.

- Okay, well, let me ask you something.

336
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,474
Do plants go through respiration?

337
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,599
- Uh, yes.

338
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:51,104
- How do you know?

339
00:11:51,104 --> 00:11:51,968
- 'Cause they're color.

340
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,944
It change colors.

341
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:54,928
- The plants change colors?

342
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:56,079
- No, the water.

343
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,902
- To what color?

344
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,721
- Dark blue.

345
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,144
- A dark blue?

346
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:05,047
- Like a darker blue.

347
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:06,952
- What does dark blue represent?

348
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,656
Let's go back to the beginning part.

349
00:12:08,656 --> 00:12:10,874
What does dark blue tell you?

350
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:13,861
Dark blue means that there's what?

351
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:18,234
Low, dark blue means
that there's low what?

352
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:22,441
[Background Chatter]

353
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,460
- Okay, and you're telling
me that respiration,

354
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,338
sorry, that respiration.

355
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:27,767
Plants go through respiration, right?

356
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:28,775
- Uh huh.

357
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,692
- So would there be a low amount of CO2,

358
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,089
if it goes through respiration?

359
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,225
- No, no.

360
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:35,882
It will be...

361
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:38,211
- Uh huh, so should it be blue?

362
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,828
- Yes, no, no, no, no.

363
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:41,847
It'd be yellow.

364
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:45,629
- Uh huh, what kind of
experiment did you do

365
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:48,894
to show me that plants
go through respiration?

366
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,474
Tia, plants go through respiration.

367
00:12:57,584 --> 00:12:58,499
- If you cut the lights on

368
00:12:58,499 --> 00:12:59,571
and cut the lights off,

369
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,295
and if you cut the lights on,

370
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:04,122
then the water turns blue

371
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:05,828
because it's giving off oxygen.

372
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,788
Cut the lights off, they won't go

373
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,826
through respiration because they --

374
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:11,642
- They won't go through respiration?

375
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,292
- No, only photosynthesis

376
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,606
because there will be no light for them.

377
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:19,893
- Stop, give me my paper.

378
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:24,336
- Okay, Tamara and Kelly O., please stop.

379
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:27,626
- And I have a question.

380
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,346
Do you want us to do

381
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:31,834
for our predictions,

382
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:33,976
do you want us to do why or why not

383
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,385
for both of them or just one?

384
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:37,687
- Even if they're different.

385
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:39,996
Maybe one of your predictions
your plants lived,

386
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,306
maybe one of your
predictions the plants die.

387
00:13:42,306 --> 00:13:43,924
- Both of them lived

388
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,971
- Then you can just, why do
you think both of them lived?

389
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,253
All right, I have a quick question.

390

Can you guys look over
here for a second?

I want a couple people to
share their predictions.

396
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,625
What helped your, when you had

397
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,440
the three plants that died, right?

398
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,460
Most of you were surprised.

399
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,488
You were like, "Wow,
how did three plants die

400
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,182
"with the lights on?

401
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,970
"They had oxygen, they had a CO2,

402
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,321
"and they died."

403
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:15,294
Right, so you were surprised.

404
00:14:15,294 --> 00:14:16,274
What was your prediction?

405
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,144
What did you set up
as an experiment

406
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:19,421
to help them survive?

407
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,973
What did you predict?

408
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,135
Nacora, give me one.

409
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:24,428
- I put three plants and one snail.

410
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,433
- Okay, so she said she put
three plants, one snail.

411
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,475
How many of you guys did
three plants and one snail?

412
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:31,339
Or a combination of plants and snails?

413
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:33,198
Okay, why did you do that?

414
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:38,198
Why did you do a combination
of plants and snails, William?

415
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:40,850
- Because the snails will produce the CO2

416
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,816
while the plants would produce the O2.

417
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,161
- Okay, so he said the
plants would produce O2,

418
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:49,013
the snails would produce CO2.

419
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,366
What's another option?

420
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:51,513
What if I said, "You know what?

421
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:52,959
"I'm gonna take all your snails."

422
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,758
[gasp]

423
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,131
Good luck keeping those
plants alive, Keyon.

424
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:58,094
If I take away all your snails,

425
00:14:58,094 --> 00:14:59,433
and I said, "Haha,

426
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,894
"you have no snails to
keep your plants alive."

427
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:03,223
Should that be a problem.

428
00:15:03,223 --> 00:15:04,101
- No.

429
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,290
- Okay, tell me why that
wouldn't be a problem.

430
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,487
Why would that not be a problem, Haley?

431
00:15:09,487 --> 00:15:12,719
- Because all you have to do is put

432
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,862
three plants in the dark.

433
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:17,372
- Okay, how is that going to help you?

434
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,828
How is putting three plants in the dark?

435
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,080
She said, "You can just turn
off the lights."

436
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,529
How would that be helpful?

437
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,111
- Because there's more CO2.

438
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,410
- Okay, more CO2.

439
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,992
Why is there more CO2?

440
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,838
- I would say you can just

441
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,205
put them in the light and the dark

442
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:32,370
'cause when they're in the light

443
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,475
they do photosynthesis,

444
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:34,800
and when they're in the dark,

445
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,324
they do respiration.

446
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:38,056
- Okay, she said, "In the
dark they use photosynthesis,

447
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:40,943
"and in the dark they do respiration."

448
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,282
Isaiah?

449
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:44,407
- Wouldn't you just turn the lights off?

450
00:15:44,407 --> 00:15:45,528
- Okay, we just said we could turn

451
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,130
the lights completely off.

452
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,922
Here's another question.

453
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,653
Do plants go through respiration?

454
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:56,304
- Yes.
- No.

455
00:15:56,304 --> 00:15:57,587
Okay, hold on.

456
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:59,345
If you said no, why are you saying

457
00:15:59,345 --> 00:16:01,087
no they don't go through respiration.

458
00:16:01,087 --> 00:16:03,692
- Because only animals
go through respiration,

459
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,299
and plants go through photosynthesis.

460
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,674
- Okay, Brandon, I want you to
set up an experiment for me.

461
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,353
Put one plant.

462
00:16:11,353 --> 00:16:13,522
Put one plant in your test
tube and turn the lights off.

463
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:16,124
Just one plant in the test
tube and turn the lights off.

464
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,171
How many people know
what's going to happen?

465
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:21,897
One plant in a test tube
with the lights off?

466
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:25,523
All right.

467
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:31,174
- Look at that.

468
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:32,671
- Okay, are the plants alive?

469
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:33,964
- Yes.

470
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:36,260
- Is there more oxygen then CO2?

471
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,268
- No.

472
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,243
- What is there more of?

473
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:40,862
- CO2.

474
00:16:40,862 --> 00:16:42,276
- How is there more CO2 in there?

475
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:43,901
It started at six and six.

476
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,858
Why is there more CO2 in there?

477
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,798
- Respiration.

478
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:52,292
- Because it's not doing photosynthesis.

479
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,255
- Because it's not going
through photosynthesis,

480
00:16:54,255 --> 00:16:56,486
but that means that
our O2 shouldn't go up.

481
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:58,705
Why is the CO2 going up?

482
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,880
Why is the CO2 going up?

483
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,193
- Because in the dark the
plants breath out CO2.

484
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:11,241
- Okay what is that process of them

485
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:14,293
breathing out, their getting rid of CO2?

486
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,260
What is that process?

487
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,794
Kaleil, you kept saying it over and over.

488
00:17:16,794 --> 00:17:18,408
- Respiration.

489
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:19,979
- All right, respiration.

490
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,456
Here's another question.

491
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:24,024
Do plants go through
respiration in the day time?

492
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:26,287
- No.

493
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:26,868
- Photosynthesis.

494
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:29,386
- What does respiration
give you as an animal?

00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:56,124
Carbon dioxide.

501
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,934
- So, respiration gives
your carbon dioxide.

502
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:00,787
If you look up here, look.

503
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:04,822
Elise, respiration gives
you carbon dioxide,

504
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,588
water, and energy, right?

505
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:09,889
Do plants, when they're
going through photosynthesis,

506
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,292
do they make energy?

507
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,013
Do you see energy in the
photosynthesis equation?

508
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:15,862
- No.

509
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:19,744
- Okay, so how do they
stay alive during the day?

510
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:22,892
Do they die during the day
and stay alive at night.

511
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:23,728
- No.

512
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,290
- Do they stay alive during
the day and die at night?

513
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:27,064
- No.

514
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:31,004
- How do they stay alive
the whole day long?

515
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:32,487
- They use the sun's energy.

516
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,867
- They use the what?

517
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,040
- The sun's energy.

518
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,737
- Okay, and then what do they
do with that glucose?

519
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,529
It just sits there 'cause
glucose isn't energy yet.

520
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:44,027
- They have to turn into
respoiration

521
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:45,208
- Oh, so do they go through

522
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,305
respiration during the day?

523
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:50,519
- Yes.
- No.

524
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,041
They have to or they would die.

525
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,821
So they make their energy.

526
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,700
They make glucose,

527
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,632
but the glucose isn't energy, Isaiah,

528
00:18:56,632 --> 00:19:00,112
until they break it down in respiration,

529
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:02,249
so do plants have to
go through respiration

530
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,846
during the day and night?

531
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:05,047
- Yes.

532
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,120
- Yes, do you go through
respiration day and night.

533
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,099
- Yes.
- No.

534
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:08,863
You don't?

535
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:09,599
- No.

536
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,288
Do you die at night every
time you go to sleep?

537
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:14,492
- That would be creepy.

538
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:15,824
- You reproduce every
time you go at night?

539
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,517
- No, what?

540
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:23,239
- No, you stay alive all day long.

541
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,311
[hushing]

542
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:27,125
You stay alive all day long, Tamara.

543
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:29,004
Plants stay alive all day long

544
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,304
because they go through respiration.

545
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,672
This is the key.

546
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,473
Respiration.

547
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,023
The key, Nikera, to getting the glucose

548
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,374
for respiration is in...

549
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:40,870
- Photosynthesis.

550
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,773
- Photosynthesis.

551
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:45,344
This is what keeps everything alive,

552
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:47,360
but to get some of the
ingredients for this,

553
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,838
you need to go through this.

554
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,755
Do you see why now we
depend on each other?

555
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,028
Ah, yes.

556
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,732
Okay, understanding.

557
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:01,996
- So, we don't go through
photosynthesis, just plants do,

558
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,403
but plants go through both.
