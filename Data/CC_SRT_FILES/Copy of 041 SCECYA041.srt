1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,980
My big goal is to be...

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,300
is to: All my 
homework, Get better grades,

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,660
Study harder than I did.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,900
Okay! It's a big, 
excellent goal. I like that.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,700
Okay!

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,220
So one of the things that helps 
me when I'm working on a goal is to

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,060
write it down and make a plan

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,580
for how to accomplish that goal.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,900
Organizing.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,340
Good job!

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,660
So what do you think today

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,660
if we work on

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,060
making this goal 
a permanent part of your plan

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,700
and taking some steps to 
really be organized with it?

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,140
Does that work for you?

16
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,220
mm hmm...
Wonderful.

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,260
Okay. So the first thing we want 
to do is write down your goal.

18
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,380
So you just said to me 
in really nice words your goal.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,100
Yes. It's to study more harder

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,380
than I used to.

21
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,780
Okay! And let's get real 
specific about your homework.

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,260
What did you say 
about your homework there?

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,700
Check over it.
-Okay.

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,620
But before you check over what 
you need to make sure you do?

25
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,580
All of it.

26
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,980
Get it completed, right? 
Okay, awesome.

27
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,900
So your goal would be to...

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,140
Get homework completed. 
-Wonderful!

29
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,180
Okay!

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,620
Excellent! Okay!

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,460
Now I brought 
some extra markers

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,820
and stuff here because 
I know you're a visual learner,

33
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,620
that you do a good job remembering things
that you figured out on your...

34
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,580
learning styles test.

35
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,740
So this is for you to do.

36
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,060
You can choose any colors to make 
it look however you want. Okay?

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,340
So you've got your goal

38
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,860
and then we need to figure 
out why is that goal important.

39
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,980
So your goal is to

40
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,980
Get all homework done.

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,820
Excellent.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,900
And why is that important?

43
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,020
Because when 
you're in fourth grade

44
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,700
you don't get all 
your homework done

45
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,460
and you on fence and

46
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,820
when you get on the fence,

47
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,620
I've been there 
a couple of times

48
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,500
and is not very fun,

49
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,660
and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels.

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,940
hmm...

51
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,780
So if you don't do your homework,

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,020
You're on a boring fence.

53
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,580
Okay! You have to stand 
by the fence at recess.

54
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,420
And if you do do your homework,

55
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,380
you go to Hotshots.

56
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,340
Homework Hotshots.

57
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,300
And that is...

58
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
What do you have to do to 
qualify for Homework Hotshots?

59
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,140
Do all your homework for all the... 


60
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,860
Oh! Wow!! So...

61
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,860
All your homework 
throughout the nine weeks

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,380
and then you get to go..
get to be a Homework Hotshot,

63
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,260
which means you 
go to Hot Wheels

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,700
and enjoy the day skating.

65
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,340
Excellent! Okay!

66
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,700
So you just brought 
up a good point.

67
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,940
umm...

68
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,500
So this goal is important

69
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,740
because not only do you 
not want to stand by the fence,

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,180
and you want to 
be a Homework Hero.

71
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,380
What's going to happen 
if you do your homework?

72
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,420
You go to Hot Wheels.

73
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,540
You go to Hot Wheels

74
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,940
and what do you think...

75
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,780
What effect is that 
going to have on your

76
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,580
report card here?

77
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,220
If you're doing all your homework, 
what's going to happen to those grades?

78
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,580
You get all the grades go up.

79
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
like the 100 - 200.

80
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,380
That's right. Very good.

81
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,460
All right.

82
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,260
So, go ahead, write that down. Why 
you think homework is important.

83
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,900
Excellent

84
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,100
So this goal is important because 
you can always get good grades.

85
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,180
and homework is 
a way that teachers

86
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,780
help the students 
reinforce the things

87
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,100
that they are learning in class.

88
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
So that's an excellent 
way to get good grades.

89
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,940
Okay! So we know our goal 
and we know why it's important.

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,740
So let's think about

91
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,620
what kind of rewards we're 
going to get for reaching that goal.

92
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,700
You get achievement awards.

93
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,260
You go in a limo

94
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,580
with the principal.

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,420
And you go out to eat.

96
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,700
and Hot Wheels too, right?

97
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,700
So those are some long-term goals

98
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,940
over the next nine weeks.

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,860
You get to complete your 
homework the next nine weeks.

100
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,980
You get to go to Hot Wheels

101
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,900
and might even be on 
the principal's honor roll

102
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,020
to take the limo ride.

103
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,060
Pretty cool, huh?

104
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,820
Okay!

105
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,860
So that's here. 
We've got

106
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,020
Don't forget one thing, that you get
to drink soda while you're going.

107
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,220
You do?

108
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,180
I didn't know that.

109
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,900
I've never been in there.

110
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,180
I've never been in the limo, but I heard.

111
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,260
Oh, my goodness!

112
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,060
Well, that certainly is a nice incentive,

113
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,660
something to motivate, huh?

114
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,380
Good!

115
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,100
So that's kind of 
a long-term motivation.

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,220
We've got to work 
hard all these nine weeks

117
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,740
to accomplish that, right?

118
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,900
Okay! So we've got here.

119
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,060
When I meet my 
goal for the quarter,

120
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,460
Quarter is another way of saying 
the nine week time period.

121
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
you will what?

122
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,060
What do you get to do if you

123
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,420
do all your homework 
over the nine weeks?

124
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,340
I will go in a limo.

125
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,500
Well, that's for principal's honor roll,

126
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,100
which is definitely an option.

127
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,300
What's specific for homework?

128
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,060
umm...

129
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,580
When I meet my goal,

130
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,940
for the quarter, 
I will go to Hot Wheels.

131
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,980
Go to Hot Wheels. 
Awesome!

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,980
Excellent.

133
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,620
So the nine weeks

134
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,100
sometimes it can feel like

135
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,260
long way away, can't it?

136
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,100
Okay!

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,980
Because nine weeks is not easy.

138
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,940
They are not easy 
to do your homework

139
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,540
Because it's a long 
time before you go

140
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,820
to Hot Wheels and we only 
have eighteen weeks in school.

141
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,900
So it's easier

142
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,940
sometimes to stay motivated 
and work towards a goal

143
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,220
if you have some

144
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,100
incentives that come on 
more of a short-term basis.

145
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,620
Meaning that instead 
of waiting all nine weeks

146
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,580
to go to Hot Wheels, 
which you will get to do,

147
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,420
if you meet your goal.

148
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,620
Let's think of something that 
we can do maybe, once a week.

149
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,580
That would be 
a good incentive for you

150
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,180
Study.

151
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,700
Okay! Well, studying is 
part of your homework plan.

152
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,140
Let's say that you study

153
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,860
and you turn all your...
you do all your homework

154
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,180
and at the end of the week 
when I check in with you,

155
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,180
when I check in with Miss. Butler,

156
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,740
and I check in with your granny,

157
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,860
and I'd say,

158
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,300
So how did Annamarie do? Did she 
get all her homework done?

159
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,980
mm hmm..

160
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,620
And they say- Yes, she did.

161
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,700
What do you think might be

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,820
something that you're willing

163
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,340
to work towards here at school

164
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,660
that would be 
a reward once a week?

165
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,180
I will come to you 
and I will help you.

166
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,060
You'd like to help me? 
All right.

167
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,340
So could we agree that

168
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,780
let's say, I check in on Fridays

169
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,220
with your teacher

170
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,900
and your granny and you

171
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
to find out- 
did she do her homework?

172
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,140
What are they going 
to tell me? -Yes. Yes

173
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,820
And then on Fridays you 
get to come and help me.

174
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,620
mm hmm..

175
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,860
That'd be wonderful.

176
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,540
Now I teach a first grade class

177
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,500
every day at 12:10.

178
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,780
I know you do a really good 
job helping out at home

179
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,500
with your niece

180
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,460
But she...

181
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,700
I do not get to

182
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,980
see her Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday

183
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,820
But on Friday, I do.

184
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,020
Because my mom... 
My mom watches her.

185
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,860
And sometimes when
my sister and I

186
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,460
and the baby's not here

187
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,220
we actually look at

188
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,180
photos of her because

189
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,980
we really miss her and 
we talk to her on phone.

190
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,580
Awesome! She's lucky 
to have an aunty like you.

191
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,420
Awesome!

192
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,740
Well I know because you do 
such a good job caring for her

193
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,060
that you'd be 
an excellent helper

194
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,260
for me and my first graders.

195
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,180
Will that be 
a good goal for you?

196
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,460
Okay! So our next section here.

197
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,820
Can you read this?

198
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:28,260
When I meet my goal 
for the week, I will get to

199
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,420
go to... go to Hot Wheels, I think.

200
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,380
Well, Hot Wheels is 
for the whole nine weeks.

201
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,100
But each week..

202
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,980
Remember our...

203
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,340
What we're working towards on 
Friday, that you get to come...

204
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,820
Help you.

205
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,300
Right. So you get to 
come help Miss. Charles. 

206
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,820
on Fridays

207
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,260
Okay!

208
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,340
You have very nice handwriting.

209
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,220
Thank you.

210
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,020
Okay! 
-So do you.

211
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,460
Thanks.

212
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,620
Okay. So this goal

213
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,020
is something that

214
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,540
you're in charge of, right?

215
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,060
You're in control 
of achieving this goal.

216
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,260
But you're not in it alone.

217
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,100
Because there's of a lot of people 
who want to see you reach that goal.

218
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,700
and to see you doing an
awesome job at school.

219
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,980
So who are some of the people

220
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,700
the adults in your life 
who are on your team

221
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,180
who can be helpers for 
you as you reach this goal.

222
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,540
My grandma, my aunty, 
my uncle, my mom and my sister.

223
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,180
Wonderful! 
You have a lot of people.

224
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,620
So these are people at home

225
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,980
that can help you 
reach your goal, all right?

226
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,900
So let's go ahead and put those 
down for supporters at home.

227
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,020
Awesome!

228
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,700
All right. So you've 
got a lot of people

229
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,900
supporting you at home.

230
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
I've got five.

231
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,060
And how about here at school?

232
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,780
Who's on your team?

233
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,900
Miss. Butler and Miss Charles.

234
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,340
You've got it girl. 

235
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,020
I can't wait

236
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,460
to support you on this goal.

237
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,340
Okay! So the people 
who can help me at school

238
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,020
is Miss. Charles

239
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,060
Is it okay if I put in Miss. Ficker?

240
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,180
my assistance teacher, 
because she helps too.

241
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,140
Definitely.

242
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,500
That's a great person to add.

243
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
And so are you.

244
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,860
Thank you.

245
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,020
Okay!

246
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,740
I just realized something.

247
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,820
What's that?

248
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,300
All these teachers 
name has a "R" in it.

249
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,060
Miss. Charles, 
Miss. Butler, Miss. Ficker.

250
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,940
It's a good attention 
to detail you have there.

251
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,980
Okay! So we know 
that our goal is to

252
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,460
get all my homework completed.

253
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,300
Okay!

254
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
And it's important because

255
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,460
you can always get good grades.

256
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,300
Excellent.

257
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,740
Now on the short-term

258
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,820
if you're doing a great job getting 
your homework done every week.

259
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,900
Each week you will get to

260
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,020
come help... come help 
Miss. Charles on Friday.

261
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,740
Excellent. And I will know that 
you're doing a great job because...

262
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,500
you can ask Miss. Butler,

263
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,620
my grandma and me.

264
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,300
That's right. Okay.

265
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,900
And over the whole nine weeks

266
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,100
when you do a good job

267
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,700
getting all that homework done

268
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
what's your reward?

269
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,580
I get to go to Hot Wheels.

270
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,780
Awesome.

271
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,060
And then although you're 
the one in charge of this goal,

272
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,100
there's a lot of 
people on your team.

273
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,740
Who are those people 
on your team from home?

274
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,580
My Mama, my granny, my sister,

275
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,060
my Uncle TJ
and my aunty (unintelligible)

276
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,340
People on you're side.

277
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,020
All right! And then when you're 
here at school, who's on your team?

278
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,380
Miss. Charles, Miss. Butler, Miss. Ficker

279
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,340
Awesome. All right.

280
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,300
So what do you think?
How's the school going to go?

281
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,660
It's going to be great, 
because I will follow all of these.

282
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,580
Good. and I'm here to help, okay?

283
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,140
All right. 
Well, I think the first step

284
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,460
towards achieving this goal is

285
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,660
to make sure that we 
manage our time really well.

286
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,980
And I know we 
talked a little bit before

287
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,380
about kind of your month.

288
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,700
We looked at 
the month of February

289
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,980
and figured out what

290
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,780
big things you have coming up.

291
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,700
What portions of 
the day you spend

292
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,540
here at school or at Church,

293
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,860
and what you do, how you help 
out taking care of your niece.

294
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,980
So that's the month of February.

295
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,300
So what we're going to do 
today is really focus on this week

296
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,740
and make a plan.

297
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,140
So what I've done here is

298
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,020
based on the information 
you told me before,

299
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,620
we've got this week

300
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,100
starting with today

301
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,620
Monday, February 7th

302
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,300
and you will notice I've the time of 
day all the way from 6 in the morning

303
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,860
throughout the day till

304
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,540
Yeah, 10 at night.

305
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,340
So I have these spaces blocked off

306
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,660
So what are you usually doing

307
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,060
Monday, Wednesday, 
Friday from 7 to 4?

308
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,260
Come to school.

309
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,180
You're at school, right?

310
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,780
So this whole area

311
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
Is school?

312
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,900
Is school. That's right.
You're here at school.

313
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,900
Will you write school? 
-Sure.

314
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,020
Sometimes it's easy for 
me if I just draw a line

315
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,180
to show that.
Like that.

316
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,580
Okay. School.

317
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,580
Okay!

318
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,420
So knowing that you're in school 
from 7 to about 4 O'clock,

319
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,660
and we also need 
to think about some other

320
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,660
regular things that 
you do during the week.

321
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,500
So you told me before

322
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
that...
