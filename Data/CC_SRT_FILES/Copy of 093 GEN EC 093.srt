1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,175
- [Male student] Dakota didn't want to
bring his... because it's all

2
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:04,453
broken.

3
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:11,558
- [Teacher] Well we can still look at it.
Go get it, honey. Actually, Hannah, bring

4
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:19,054
Dakota's petroglyph over, please. Yeah,
that's the thing with clay. It breaks very

5
00:00:19,054 --> 00:00:24,743
easily. Okay. All right. Will you still be
able to tell us about it?

6
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,486
- He said that it exploded.

7
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:32,968
- Please don't break it any more. Are you
going to be able to talk about it still?

8
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:36,939
You can tell us what was on it. Okay, put
it down, Addy, or it's going to break.

9
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:43,820
Okay. So you guys, you did... Your small
group was Washoe, and you're going to

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,210
present to the whole group next week or
the next week after.

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:47,630
- The whole group?

12
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,150
- The whole classroom.

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,670
- Okay.

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,200
- Okay. So what I need you to do for a
little bit is talk between yourselves

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,910
about what you found. And the four things
that I want you to make sure somebody

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,740
knows something about: food, shelter,
clothing, and location. But if you found

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,550
something else you want to talk about, go
ahead. So anybody, chime in.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,580
- Okay. I think I know where they're
located.

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,710
- Can you tell us?

20
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,880
- South Lake Tahoe.

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,290
- [Female student] I know what they ate.

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,040
- In your strong voice though.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,938
- They ate onions. They ate wild potatoes,
wild carrots...

24
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:32,195
- I think a little bit...

25
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:36,831
- Wild mustard, sunflower seeds, wild
carrots, wild potatoes, wild strawberries,

26
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:44,301
raspberries, wild gooseberries, wild
rosehips, wild rhubarb, pine nuts, and

27
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,362
they used...

28
00:01:46,362 --> 00:01:51,141
- Sweet potatoes, wild turnips, wild
spinach... seeds...

29
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:54,625
- Okay. Do you think we're good on food?

30
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,547
- [Together] Yeah.

31
00:01:55,547 --> 00:01:56,161
- Okay.

32
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,354
- I think Olivia got the part.

33
00:01:57,354 --> 00:01:59,988
- Well, we'll talk about that after. So we
have location...

34
00:01:59,988 --> 00:02:01,547
- Shelter.

35
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:03,208
- Go ahead. Okay. Who's going to go next?

36
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:06,487
- [Coleman] I have they used sticks and
leaves to build their homes.

37
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,540
- Okay. What do you have your
information on?

38
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:14,218
- I have clothing. They used rabbit
skins, buckskins, and plants.

39
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,484
- Okay. And I'm sorry, Coleman.
What did you say?

40
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:21,212
- They used sticks and leaves to build
their homes.

41
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:26,377
- Okay. So you got those four covered. Any
fun facts you guys found? Dakota, what did

42
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:31,093
you find out? Give us one fun fact.

43
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:37,324
- [Dakota] In 1859 the Washoe... Wait.

44
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:42,846
- Let Dakota, guys. Remember, we're trying
to be good listeners.

45
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,652
- In 18...

46
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:47,335
- Go ahead, sweetie.

47
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:54,564
- In 1859 the Washoe had about 90 people
[inaudible] times.

48
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:55,752
- Aw.

49
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:58,857
- No, no, not 90, 900.

50
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:06,887
- Can I see what you wrote?
They had 90,000, or?

51
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,306
- Nine hundred.

52
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:10,630
- Nine hundred, and now
they only have 300?

53
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:16,600
- No, let's see. The population. Well I
got it off the computer.

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,388
- Yeah, I got 1500.

55
00:03:18,388 --> 00:03:30,686
- In 1855 the Washoe numbered about 900.
But are now reduced to about a third of

56
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:31,901
that number.

57
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:34,113
- What that the same fact you had, Dakota?

58
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,000
- Yeah.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,597
- Yeah, very good. Thank you, Dakota.

60
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:43,492
- I got in 2007, there was 1500. But I got
it off the computer too and it said that.

61
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:45,082
- Well, you know the computer
is not always...

62
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:46,619
- I got the latest.

63
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:51,618
- What kind of data did you get? Like
demographic? Or where did you get yours

64
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:52,648
from?

65
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:56,636
- I got it from Google.

66
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:02,777
- Well guys, 300 was what yours said,
Dakota? And yours said 1500?

67
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,116
- Yeah.

68
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:07,905
- Are you sure yours wasn't 1500 from
before? And now it's 300?

69
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:09,495
- Well it said in 2007.

70
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:10,389
- Okay.

71
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,244
- On here, on my brain copy.

72
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:15,663
- Okay. We might need to look at that some
more, you guys. We'll look into that

73
00:04:15,663 --> 00:04:20,030
before we report on that. But that would
be a fun fact anyway. Joe, did you tell us

74
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,215
anything?

75
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:23,332
- [Joe] Yeah. I have another fun fact.

76
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,371
- Okay.

77
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:28,231
- A fun fact. Their houses are called
Gadus.

78
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:32,086
- Gadus, okay. Okay. Now
who hasn't had a turn, guys? All of you

79
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:35,590
got your hands up. Let's include our
little friend, Addy. Okay.

80
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,540
- [Addy] They made baskets.

81
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,729
- Any good baskets?

82
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:45,502
- Mostly Dot So La Lee.

83
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,125
- Most famous one.

84
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,230
- She was famous for making baskets.

85
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,180
- What was she famous for, Olivia?

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,522
- [Olivia] She was the... She made the
most baskets than other Washoe people, the

87
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:01,481
other Indians.

88
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:05,943
- And why was she more famous
than all the other Indians?

89
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:10,659
- I don't know that, but I think she was
like a really good basket-maker.

90
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:12,438
- You think she was a good... Can you
scoot over?

91
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,532
- I can, yeah.

92
00:05:13,532 --> 00:05:18,352
- Okay. Did you guys get to see any of the
samples of the baskets?

93
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,542
- [Together] Yes.

94
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:29,055
- Did you know that they're in very... Oh,
you have a picture? Awesome. These are

95
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,201
actually Dot So La Lee's baskets?

96
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,382
- Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:36,940
- Okay. So the thing, if you every get to
see one of Dot So La Lee's baskets,

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,750
they're woven so tight, you could carry
water in them. And we talked about

99
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:51,840
symmetry today in math. They're perfectly
symmetrical. Yes, they're woven so tight

100
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,810
that you can put water in them.

101
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,750
- And even Dot So La Lee had like 2000.

102
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,150
- You what?

103
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,760
- She had made that many baskets.

104
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,230
- She made how many?

105
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,510
- A lot.

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,570
- Two thousand.

107
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,440
- Two hundred and something.

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,640
- Wow. It would be nice to have one of
those now, huh?

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,300
- Yeah. But they're like... You can't even
buy them.

110
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,960
- You cannot buy them, huh?

111
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,020
- They're like in a museum.

112
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,940
- They're in museums, but I think some
people do have a private collection of

113
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,180
them.

114
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,800
- Really?

115
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,140
- Maybe one or two, yeah. They're not like
our petroglyphs that we're going to talk

116
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,110
about. Can you have a petroglyph in your
private collection?

117
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,760
- [Together] No.

118
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,330
- Those you can't have. Okay. So you guys,
let's see, who wants to be the writer? Do

119
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:38,270
you have a pencil? Grab that pencil. Would
you write your tribal name up here? You

120
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,370
guys are Washoe. And then go around, Addy,
and find out. Write the name of the person

121
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,665
next to the food, the shelter, and that's
what you're going to kind of be

122
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:56,040
responsible for. Let's get Addy... And you
can go around and ask each person, or you

123
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,750
can say, "Who wants to do food?"
W-A-S-H-O-E.

124
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,460
- I'll do fun facts.

125
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,860
- I'll do shelter.

126
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,140
- I'll do fun facts.

127
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,470
- No, I'll do shelter.

128
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,370
- Okay. How are we going to decide?

129
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,251
- Joe should do the clothing.

130
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,189
- Joe should do
clothing.

131
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,850
- Is that okay with you?

132
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,300
- Do you think I should tell you the name of the...

133
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:26,410
- Hold on. We're not doing these. We'll do
that later. Thank you, Olivia. Olivia

134
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,870
volunteered for food. Joe, do you really
want to do clothing?

135
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,645
- [Joe] I was either going to do clothing
or language, because I found a whole thing for...
136
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:38,690
- Everybody can do a fun fact too.

137
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,750
- But I was going to do a fun facts.

138
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,630
- We need somebody to do food and
location.

139
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,440
- Okay. I'll do location.

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,770
- Shelter.

141
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,651
- Shelter and location.

142
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,165
- I got... I'll get shelter.

143
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:57,180
- Good. Thank you, Coleman. And then, I
know you guys want to do fun facts too, so

144
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,581
everybody can do a fun fact.

145
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,757
- L-E, and then M-A-N.

146
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,044
- C-O-L-E-M-A-N.

147
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,198
- L-E.

148
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:12,450
- L-E-M-A-N. Okay. Now we just have
location left.

149
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,036
- But what's Dakota doing?

150
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:17,110
- What do you want to do?

151
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,830
- How about me and Dakota will do location
together?

152
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,960
- Does that work? Okay.

153
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,420
- That's who's going to do the fun fact.

154
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,420
- Everyone can do a fun fact. So write,
"Thomas/Dakota" for location. No, don't

155
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:38,340
worry about fun facts. Everybody has got a
fun fact right there. So if both of you are

156
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:48,310
doing it, it's got to be super duper.
[Background Chatter]

157
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:56,317
- Okay, so, we're going to look up if they
lived in Washoe. They probably did.

158
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:58,483
[Background Chatter]

159
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:01,183
- Did you have their names down, Addy?

160
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:08,899
- It's like, Washoe people...
[Background Chatter]

161
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,338
- Where are you guys going to find the
information, Dakota?

162
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:12,732
- And Dakota.

163
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:14,850
- D-A-K-O-T-A.

164
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,990
- Better... You guys, what did we find
out about Google? Maybe you want to find

165
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,250
two. If you have two things and they don't
say the same thing, you might want to

166
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,150
check another one.

167
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,577
- There's a lot of maps on Google.

168
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:27,580
- There's a lot of maps on Google?

169
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,774
- Yeah.

170
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:31,568
- We're going to go... We're going to go
on maps and look where...

171
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:36,765
- Okay. Thanks. I'm going to take that so
when you... Okay. So next week or the week

172
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:41,445
after, you guys are going to do a whole
group, class presentation on your tribe.

173
00:09:41,445 --> 00:09:47,520
And you're welcome to bring pictures, or
artifacts, or like pieces of whatever, if

174
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,980
you want to do that. You can bring a
basket. Obviously, it's not going to be a

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,680
Dot So La Lee.

176
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,980
- Can I bring a arrowhead?

177
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,161
- Did your tribe have arrowheads?

178
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,197
- Yeah.

179
00:10:00,111 --> 00:10:04,985
- Okay. Now, looking in front of you, you
guys, for our art project we did something.

180
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:09,083
What is this called. Who knows? Olivia? I
like how you raised your hand.

181
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,295
- The petrograph.

182
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:12,340
- Louder. Petro...

183
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,240
- The petrograph.

184
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:22,700
- Petroglyphs. And what is a petroglyph?
You're going to break yours, Thomas. Addy,

185
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,600
what's a petroglyph?

186
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,160
- It's a carving in a rock.

187
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,824
- A carving in a rock. Did your tribe make
petroglyphs?

188
00:10:28,824 --> 00:10:30,366
- We don't know.

189
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,688
- Why don't you know?

190
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:36,550
- 'Cuz they put things like right down.
They made it. They just moved. They just

191
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:42,190
carved it in and nobody really knows,
unless there's someone from that tribe who

192
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,534
made it and passed it down,
generation to generation.

193
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:48,760
- Yes. Very good. What were
you going to say?

194
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,855
- You know when we were looking on that
website? We were looking on that website

195
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:55,828
...and one said,
"Washoe."

196
00:10:55,828 --> 00:11:00,468
- Okay. Yes. So some of them they attri...
They say that they did it, but we don't

197
00:11:00,468 --> 00:11:06,770
know who did what petroglyphs. But in our
state, can we narrow it down to one of

198
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,380
four tribes probably? And maybe, if they
found petroglyphs where your location was,

199
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,460
you could say those were Shoshone
petroglyphs? Would that work?

200
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,170
- We're Washoe.

201
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,519
- Washoe. I'm sorry. All right. So who
wants to share theirs first? So what

202
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,540
you're going to do is you're going to
share it, and show the whole group, and

203
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,696
tell us what yours meant to you. Okay?

204
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:29,798
- Okay.

205
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:37,935
- Addy, you want to call on somebody?
Since everybody is dying to talk. Who's

206
00:11:37,935 --> 00:11:39,390
going first?
- Coleman.

207
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,260
- Coleman, can we see yours? Okay. I want
to zoom in on it. Hold it up a little bit,

208
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,064
because I got it up. Okay. What does yours
mean to you?

209
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:58,190
- It means that it's night, and there's
some stars, and there's a duck. And then

210
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:06,654
there's a canoe on the water.
And there is a lot of meat and camping.

211
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:09,738
- Camping. Okay. Anybody else want to go?

212
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,472
- Pass it around.

213
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:13,696
- Joseph. Oh, don't pass it around. We
don't want to break it. We're going to

214
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:25,800
stick them on wood or something. Oh, let
me get a picture. Oh, I'm zooming in. Up

215
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,525
higher, Joe, because I've got this on a
tripod. Okay. All right.

216
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:36,450
- Mine is we're going to
drink some water from a river with fish in

217
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,710
it and a duck on top. And there's a snake
trying to eat the duck. There's an eagle.

218
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,756
It's daytime and the skies are clear.

219
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,110
- Oh Addy, you're calling on people. Thank
you. Okay. Addy, sit back a little bit so

220
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,290
we can see Miss Olivia.

221
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,360
- ...random things, but
I think I know what it is. It means

222
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,312
they're hunting buffalo at night. And then
the daytime came and it's all

223
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:14,913
rainbow. And we caught
some fish. That's it.

224
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:22,017
- Okay. Good. Who wants to
go now? Thomas. Nice.

225
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:29,260
- So there's a camp and there's a little
hill behind the camp. And there's people

226
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,170
in war, and there's a snake. And then, one
person is not in war. He's just trying to

227
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:42,413
shoot a duck. But then the other guy shot
him, and then there's... And this has been

228
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:44,249
happening for three days.

229
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:46,523
- Okay. Dakota.

230
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:55,953
- Mine kind of blew up here.
Mine kind of blew...

231
00:13:55,953 --> 00:13:57,601
- What happened to yours, honey?

232
00:13:57,601 --> 00:14:01,834
- It like kind of didn't turn out so well.
It like blew up in pieces.

233
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,778
- Can you tell us what it was before it
blew up in pieces?

234
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:08,850
- Well it was like, I don't know.

235
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,118
- Did you have like hunting
symbols, or anything?

236
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:15,209
- No.

237
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:17,649
- He just did like squares.

238
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,234
- I drew lines because I... 
I remember I didn't really know

239
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,803
what to write.

240
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:26,127
- You didn't know what to write? Okay.
That's all right. But if you could do it

241
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,146
again, what would you do?
What would it mean to you?

242
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:31,915
- I'd probably make up a war thing.

243
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,186
- A war thing? Okay.

244
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,109
- It's more war, except hunt.

245
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,822
- Hunting? Oh, okay. Did you go, Miss
Addy? Okay.

246
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:43,512
- Humans were hunting for humans. That's
what's on mine.

247
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:46,504
- Okay. Addy, I would wait until everybody
was listening. Thank you.

248
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:49,269
- I can't show your...

249
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:51,505
- Okay. Just show the other children.

250
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:56,818
- It's a sunny day. A snake is trying to
eat the fish. The fish are in the river.

251
00:14:56,818 --> 00:15:00,783
- Cool. What's the little zigzag?

252
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,476
- Mountains.

253
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:04,354
- Oh, those are mountains? Oh, cool.

254
00:15:04,354 --> 00:15:08,465
- Sun. Snake. River. Just fishing.

255
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:10,607
- Just fishing.

256
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:16,170
- So, what other kind of art things could
we have done to show your tribe? What

257
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,175
would have been your tribe only?

258
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,336
- Baskets.

259
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,572
- We could have maybe tried to weave
something. What else?

260
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:25,118
- Basket, but [inaudible]...

261
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:29,057
- That wouldn't be too fun. In our
project, like we could pretend that we

262
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,000
were real...
