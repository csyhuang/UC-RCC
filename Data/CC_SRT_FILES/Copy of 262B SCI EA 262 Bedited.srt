1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
- It'll disintegrate (unintelligible)

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,034
- [Teacher] Okay.

3
00:00:06,034 --> 00:00:06,951
So, as a quick vote,

4
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:08,318
how many people thought,

5
00:00:08,318 --> 00:00:10,418
on this one, oh, sorry, Kevin, go ahead.

6
00:00:10,418 --> 00:00:15,384
- Also, I think it's gonna decrease,

7
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:18,118
because, the paper's gonna burn

8
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,034
and incinerate, but also, the match,

9
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:21,851
when you light the match,

10
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,184
it's gonna burn, too.

11
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:23,701
- Okay.

12
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,417
Some of you, maybe,
forgot about the match.

13
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:27,401
I haven't heard you
mention it, until just now,

14
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,851
so that, not only is
the paper gonna burn up,

15
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,061
but so will, at least part of, the match.

16
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,902
Okay, 'cause it's burning too, alright?

17
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:36,584
A quick vote.

18
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:37,734
How many people, on this one,

19
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:41,015
said the mass would go
down, would decrease?

20
00:00:41,015 --> 00:00:43,484
And how many said it would increase?

21
00:00:43,484 --> 00:00:45,584
And, how many said it'd stay the same?

22
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:48,447
So, the majority of you are
on the decrease side, on this.

23
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:51,817
Okay, here's my next question.

24
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,318
We've now heard what a bunch of people

25
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:57,355
had to say, about each
different situation.

26
00:00:57,355 --> 00:00:59,052
One, if it would increase, or decrease,

27
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,318
or stay the same.

28
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:02,384
My question to you now is that,

29
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:03,518
after listening to all the people

30
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,251
throw ideas out there,

31
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:10,235
has anybody changed their
mind on any of these?

32
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:11,184
In other words,

33
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:13,036
like, maybe for the ice in the water one,

34
00:01:13,036 --> 00:01:14,451
I was thinking it was going to increase,

35
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:15,749
but, after listening to every one,

36
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:17,717
now, I think it's gonna decrease.
