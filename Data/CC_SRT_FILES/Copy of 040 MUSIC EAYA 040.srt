1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:09,890
- [Instructor] Okay. Look at your music.
We are doing four parts, obviously. With

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:15,890
them, take just a general idea for the
whole thing. Raise your hand if you see or

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:25,250
have any eighth notes in the whole song.
Raise your hand if you ever sing eighth

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,900
notes. Sopranos, where do you have eighth
notes? Shelby, tell me.

5
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,028
- [Shelby] Measure nine.

6
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:32,303
- [Instructor] Say it really loud so they
all hear you.

7
00:00:32,303 --> 00:00:33,039
- [Shelby] Measure nine.

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,873
- [Instructor] Measure nine, very good.
Audrey, where do you have eighth notes?

9
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,180
- [Audrey] Measure thirteen.

10
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:42,706
- [Instructor] Thirteen, good. Reese,
where do you have eighth notes?

11
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:45,830
- [Reese] Measure nine and measure...

12
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:50,440
- [Instructor] Measure nine and thirteen. 
Hey, what do you notice about the soprano part and

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,610
the bass part, then? Same rhythm. Almost
the same rhythm all the way through.

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,825
Tenors, where do you have eighth notes?
Braden.

15
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,489
- [Braden] Twenty-one and twenty-two.

16
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,550
- [Instructor] Twenty-one and twenty-two. 
So, getting toward the very, very end. Altos,

17
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,350
tell us something about your part
rhythmically. Raise your hand. Give me a

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,680
summation of what you do. Jamie.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,844
- [Jamie] We don't have any.

20
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:12,628
- [Instructor] You don't have any at all?
You only have quarter notes, half notes

21
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:17,360
and some whole notes. So, how many beats does
a half note take up, everybody?

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,370
- [Together] Two.

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,610
- [Instructor] Two, make sure you last
long enough through that and then look up

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,234
at the whole notes. Solfège, what key are
we in? Where is Do? Brady.

25
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:29,290
- [Brady] F.

26
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,420
- [Instructor] F major. So, the first
pitch that the altos have is...

27
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,738
- [Together] Do.

28
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,818

starting pitch?

29
00:01:35,818 --> 00:01:36,491

30

31
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:39,365

34
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:44,620

Find areas where there were problems for
you. Overall, you did extremely well. You

81
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,060
listened to each other. You could hear
that it sounded like music. If you weren't

82
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,640
sure about an interval, you would sing it
and then you would go, "Oh, this is right

yes," and you were affirmed. And I think
you got more confident as you went along.

Problem areas. Raise your hands if you had
one. Chelsea.

00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:02,130
- [Chelsea] My problem I had was with
measure seventeen.

86
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,323
- [Instructor] Seventeen. Sopranos, do to
fa, that's a like a little bit of a tricky

87
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:09,270
leap and some of you hesitated a little
bit there. So, then you heard it, and you

88
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,900
were able to go on, and then I liked when you
got it again when you got back to nineteen.

- [Instructor] Twenty? Yes, and what did
you do?

96
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,603
- [Grant] I couldn't figure out the notes, I
mean I couldn't figure out the [inaudible].

97
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,110
- [Instructor] I think it surprises you
because you move up by a step. You were

98
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,400
fine, so, la, and the ti, you weren't
willing to actually sing ti, because it's

99
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,940
not very often that you sing it. Stepwise
motion, so, la, ti, do. You did an

100
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,016
excellent job, basses, throughout, then
returning to so and do when you had it.

101
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,804
You had some issues with fa and la.
Colin.

102
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:04,257
- [Colin] Six and seven. Where we were
going from la to fa, and then back to do,

103
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:09,140
and then we had an eighth notes. Because
of that...

104
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,350
- [Instructor] Okay. So, being aware of
when you have eighth notes. And, chances

105
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,940
are there isn't ever a point where you
have eighth notes that other people don't.

106
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,910
So, when you hear it, then you can move with
them, and it's always by step when you

107
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,450
have eighth notes. And it's always
ascending. So, you don't have to worry

108
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,050
about going down anywhere, but, yes, fa
and la continue to be icky. I didn't time

109

sorry. Okay, so we fixed the things that

they're like one long [inaudible]

and sometimes I [inaudible].

129
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,938
- [Instructor] Okay. So, there are a
couple little slips with stepwise motion

130

did a lot better than the second time.

132
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:48,514
- [Instructor] I would agree. The first
time you did better than the second. There

133
00:12:48,514 --> 00:12:53,320
are a couple of reasons for this. Raise
your hand if you feel like, when you think

134
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:01,292
back on how well you've done both times
you did better the first time. Why? Why?

135

Emily.

136
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:13,760

trying to get it right, so the second time

137
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,520
we've already gone through it, so we relaxed
a little and little things slip up.

138
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,030
- [Instructor] Okay. Some of you may have
relaxed just a little bit too much. What

139
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,200
else possibly? Colin.

140
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,210

too over-confident.

141
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,230
- [Instructor] Ohhh, that's an excellent
thing to check. Just making sure some of

142
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,970
you don't get a little over-confident.
Although, basses, the fa's and la's were

143
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,670
much better this time as an overall
section. Amanda.

144
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,746
- [Amanda] If the first time usually
there's a few problem areas for me then I

145
00:13:43,746 --> 00:13:48,930
try to focus on them way too much and then
I see the spots where it might have been

146
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:55,362
tricky for me, like that jump from la to
do. So, I freak myself out about that even

147
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,282
though I got it right both times.

148
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:58,530
- [Instructor] You get stuck in your head
a little bit.

149
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,042
- [Amanda] Yeah.

150
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,890

152
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:07,042
- [Ariella] Along with what Emily said about
how we sometimes get over-confident

153
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:11,842
because we've already seen it and we just
fly by it because we're not really trying

mi. I went back to the so because that's

156
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,306
what we did on the first page.

157
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,674
- [Instructor] Oh, okay, because you're
remembering, now, the patterns that you

158
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:31,906
had. You get the patterns mixed up when
you actually start to sing it the second

159
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:34,562
time. That's a good thought, too.
Michaella.

160
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:37,698
- [Michaella] Between the [inaudible] and 
because we to sing notes over and over again.

161
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:42,338
over and over again. I didn't like it.
It's kind of hard. I didn't get the first

162
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:48,002
two notes right and finally on like, the third
note. I think I just figured out what we were doing.

163
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,050
- [Instructor] Patrick.

164
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:57,790
- [Patrick] I think that sometimes [inaudible]
because we've already sung the music and now I think

165
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,000
that we kind of know what's going on.
