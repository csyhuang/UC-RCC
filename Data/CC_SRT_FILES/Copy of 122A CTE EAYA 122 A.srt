1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,340
- Now, watch this felt as I
pull this up and down. See those bubbles

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,440
in it? Right here, I got the bubbles at
the top that means I gotta pull it down to

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,960
get those out. You want this stuff
laying flat. If it doesn't it'll probably

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,490
show up underneath the machinery. If I
pull it down too far, it pulls a wrinkle

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,430
in the bottom. So you want to make sure
you get it straight and get all the

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,840
wrinkles out of it. I've got them out and
I'm just a little bit below my line right

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,840
here, but that's okay. It's more important
that this is out right here, that it's on.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,056
Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,760
- So just make sure. Now you want to come
out here at this point and get you one

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,550
right here. Don't forget our nailing
pattern that we discussed. Here, here,

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,260
here, here, and here. You can feel right
here where the plywood is. You want to put

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,430
a button right here, and your nail line is
going to be right in here on this. You

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,870
don't want to nail into the fascia board.
You want to come right across in here and

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,650
put them every six inches. And about every
two feet right here, and one occasionally.

15
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,290
Be careful not to step on the felt. Step
on the buttons so you don't end up

16
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:20,000
sliding. Just be careful anytime that
you're stepping on felt. You never want to

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,953
step on loose felt. Okay? All right. Go
ahead and nail that off.

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,821
This one right here.
See how you're doing this shingle?

19
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,680
- Yeah.

20
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:58,280
- We're gonna come back with a starter
right here, turned upside down. This right

21
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,210
here is gonna have to be cut off.
So go ahead and just cut this off even,

22
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,150
that'll be fine right now. This one over
here, don't nail that yet. Hold on just a

23
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:16,290
second. Come here a minute. You can do it
that way. That's one way that you can run

24
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:24,580
it down and cut it, or right here I can just take
this soldier, just like this, and I can cut it

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,930
off right here. Or I can just lap it up
there and nail it like it is. The other

26
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,830
soldier is coming down to right here. So
just come up here and cut this off. Got

27
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,190
your hook weight on you?
- Yeah

28
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,690
- Take and cut one tab off of the shingle,
flush it up and nail it on and then go

29
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,590
ahead and start your starter tabs up
there.

30
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,390
- It doesn't have to be straight right? I
just cut it?

31
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,320
- Pardon?

32
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,400
- Does it have to be straight? Just
eyeball it?

33
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,680
- No, it doesn't have to be perfectly
straight, just go ahead and hook your hook

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:09,500
blade right here and pull it straight
back. That'll be fine. Hold it down. There

35
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,940
you go. Never cut back on your handle.
These right here we'll be able to use for

36
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,740
the caps on top so don't throw these away.
Tabs always go in on these. So make sure

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,730
your tab's in, flush it up, and nail it
off. Once you've done this you need to

38
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,230
pull a layout, and in the classroom we
talked about layout on three tab shingles.

39
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,340
If we're gonna go off the end of the
building what are we gonna pull?

40
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,908
- Thirty, 36.

41
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:41,220
- We're gonna pull 36 inches, and we're
gonna pull 30 inches. Top and bottom,

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,108
topping your lines.
- All right.

43
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,000
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah

44
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,960
- Okay so do that. Once you nail this off
do that, and then run your starters. You

45
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:59,800
can go ahead and cut that off.

46
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,850
The inches right here you can go ahead
and cut them, come right here and cut it

47
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,540
off right here on the edge of the plywood
and then that will have you ready to put

48
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:34,470
your shingles on in a minute. You got a
hook blade? Y'all have it? You go ahead

49
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,960
and do that, then you can do the other
side right here.

50
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,920
-[Background Chatter]

51
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,200
- Go ahead and get your lines snapped, put
them on there and mark it and pop your

52
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,130
lines. Either way. You can do it either
way, it doesn't matter, but since we're

53
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,621
gonna go ahead and start these they need
to be on the 30x36 way out anyway. Flush

54
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:57,430
it up and hang it.
[Background chatter]

55
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,170
- Don't pull that down. If you do that's
just gonna take and break that shingle

56
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,310
off. This right here is establishing the
overhang that we wanted, that inch and a

57
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,950
quarter off the edge of the building; so we
want our finished shingles to come right

58
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:26,530
here also. When you pull your 30x36 for
your layout on your three tab you want to

59
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:34,370
go all the way to the edge of the soldier
joist. Go ahead and mark that at the top.

60
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,040
You need to keep them moving, you gotta
have it marked up there. Go ahead and mark

61
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,950
it up there, and mark it right here. Get
these popped and then you can go ahead and

62
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,325
get Darius to get you a shingle and have
it ready to go and y'all will be ready to

63
00:05:51,325 --> 00:05:54,111
put these things on. Put your starter on
it...

64
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,038
- Here? Thirty and 36.

65
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:40,307
- It's raining buttons. See that button
landed right there? Y'all make sure that

66
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:49,150
you pick these things up when you're done.
You should be able to reach right here and

67
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,248
nail this plywood on without any problem.
Once they get right here, you can't nail

68
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,777
it move down the line.

69
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:30,680
[Background Chatter]
*Hammering*

70
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,380
- Talk to him, what do you want him to do?

71
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,156
- Put a nail right there.

72
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:51,560
- There you go. Brandon is telling you
right. Y'all hold on a minute. What does

73
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,580
putting a nail right there do? I mean
you're about to put it right there--

74
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,500
- It holds it center, because that way no
bubbles or nothing comes up.

75
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,060
- It's gonna hold it right.

76
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,990
- Keeps it straight.

77
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,290
- So really you can start putting buttons
from down there to here, it's not going to

78
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,720
affect anything. Because he's got that
button in. From this point on we can't

79
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,890
put any more buttons in it until he gets
it where he wants it down here.

80
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,170
- He nails it off.

81
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,970
- Right, but you could nail this. Go ahead
and start doing that. Working together as

82
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,920
a group to get the job done is what it's
all about. This is not a one man job, you

83
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:31,916
can't roll this stuff out and do it by
yourself. It's not a one person job.

84
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,740
- If you want to mark that and pull that
up to where you can get to it there's

85
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,510
nothing wrong with doing that. What you
don't want to do is put your foot on that

86
00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:03,857
felt right in there. Watch about cutting back
towards your hand like that. Just be real careful.

87
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:12,770
There ya go. Mike, put your hand on that roll
for him.

88
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:25,710
I got it. That may not be enough to cap
that ridge off. So we can roll it as far

89
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:32,530
down as it will go and piece it if we need
to. You need a button in it now. He needs

90
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,320
help. Help him right here. Yes, sir?
- Where at?

91
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,720
- Hold on, come on the line right there?

92
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,650
- Yeah, come on right here.

93
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:52,480
- Is that on right?

94
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:01,164
- Yeah, next put the felt right here. As
far as starting this next row, you got a

95
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,556
line on...
- Thirty-six inches.

96
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:11,300
- You got a line on 36 inches, and you've
got a line on 30 inches. We want to make

97
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,590
sure that when you start this next run
that you're not breaking. Let me see a

98
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:25,310
shingle, right here, I want you to watch. 
I've worked on several houses, the whole boxing 
fascia boards and

99
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:34,520
all this is rotten on the house. The
reason for that was this right here. They

100
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,540
put their starter on like you're supposed
to, to allow for the throats of the

101
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,270
shingles. We have no water penetration
down here. But once you start this starter

102
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:51,300
tabs up, over to your 36 inch line, if I
laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it

103
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,620
off I have a straight avenue of water to
get down to this felt. This felt will only

104
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,720
hold for so long. It's going to get down
here, it will rot it out and there you're

105
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:08,000
gonna be. So you wanna make sure that you
start this on your 30 inch line and

106
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:19,620
then, give me one more shingle. Then
when you butt this shingle up to this one,

107
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,000
now what I have is I got my break right
here in the center of the full tab and I'm

108
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:29,130
six inches away from it. That's why our nailing
pattern here is important. You want

109
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,290
to nail above every throat, in the far
line, slightly above, in a three tab

110
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,106
shingle. Four nails, 1,2,3,4. Just like we
discussed on the PowerPoint--

111
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:40,638
- Above the tar line?
- Pardon?

112
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:42,589
- Above the tar line?
- I can't hear you.

113
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:43,611
- Above the tar line?

114
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:47,100
- It can be in or slightly above. Most
people are gonna put them in them or

115
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:54,140
slightly above them. Your video PowerPoint
was slightly above, but the main

116
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,910
important thing here is that you have it
to where...

117
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,380
If you put them in random, if I put one
right here, or in the middle of these two.

118
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,820
I could possibly have a nail where I got a
shingle breaking. Or I could possibly have

119
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,690
a nail in line with a throat that's gonna
line up on top of the next one. It's

120
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,160
important to go here, here, here and
here. The purpose of this tar line is when

121
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,000
this sun heats it, and it heats up you
have the next shingle on top of here it

122
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,640
helps secure it down so wind don't take
and blow it up and rip the shingle off.

123
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,270
- So it melts down?

124
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,500
- It'll actually seal and melt down to
it. All right, you're doing good, but go

125
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,680
ahead and make sure that you do this with
this hot sun out here today you will wanna

126
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,800
keep these cut. So use a shingle to square
it up or your speed square. Mark your line

127
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,130
and cut it straight down right here. You
can nail it on first, that will be fine.

128
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,550
Or you can go ahead and cut it before you
nail it. You see this shingle right here,

129
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,790
that's got the little slit in it? That is
exactly six inches is what that is. So you

130
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,880
can take this shingle, right here. Put
your speed square up here, take your hook

131
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,810
blade and follow along it and cut that
off. Then you can nail it on if you wanted

132
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,500
to do that. Either way, there's multiple
different ways to do it. The main thing is

133
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,110
don't just take this, put it on the 30
inch line, nail it down, and don't do

134
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,810
anything else to it until you get up
there. Y'all do it as you go. These hot

135
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,090
days like this cool that down and it won't
get it's form back. It'll look bad. So we

136
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,675
want to keep it looking good. All right,
how we doing?

137
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:35,300
- Good

138
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:40,059
- Good. What about right here?
[Background Chatter]

139
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,679
- You need to put it along the edge, if
you don't follow along the edge...

140
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,433
- There's three buttons if you started,
one at the top one at the bottom. What's

141
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:58,518
missing? One in between so let's get them
in there.

142
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,608
Jake you mind getting that one?

143
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,660
- Is that going to be enough to roll all
this?

144
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,840
- If not, we'll get another roll and
finish it out. Just go ahead and run with

145
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,380
what you got. That'll be okay that will
lay down beneath.

146
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:57,160
Be careful about the top edge of that
felt. Run that, y'all can stand on this.

147
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,460
Get a couple more buttons in between here,
we're a little far apart right here. I

148
