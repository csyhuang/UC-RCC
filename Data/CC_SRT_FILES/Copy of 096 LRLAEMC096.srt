00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,160
- Welcome to our kindergarten classroom.
The library is the heart of our room where

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,420
books are labeled and sorted by genre and
reading level to facilitate student

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,460
self-selection. This is also where we
display author studies, current student

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,180
work and student-made literacy charts.
This is where we have our writing center,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,940
more level texts, classroom volunteer
supplies and a lending library. Math work

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,690
is on display and student portfolios are
organized and easily accessible. We have a

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,010
few tables to facilitate guided
instruction and small group learning.

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,240
Our schedule and calendar are housed in
this part of the room and we have a

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,960
message board which is portable and used
for modeled and interactive reading and

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,510
writing. Our learning center's chart
organizes student movement around the

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,870
classroom and our word wall houses high
frequency words and rich tier-2 vocabulary

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,790
words.
"But on the morning of the fair, the

13
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,320
little calf was nowhere to be found. She
had wandered down to Mud Pond by the

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:14,780
cornfield to cool off. When she waded into
the muddy water, her feet sank. With every

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:26,210
step, she sank deeper and deeper and
deeper. The little calf was stuck in Mud

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:33,680
Pond."
"'Get the hands! Get the helpers!' the

17
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:40,100
farmer shouted when he saw her. All the
farm hands came running with their ropes,

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:47,010
but the more they tugged, the more stuck
the calf got. 'Get the big yellow

19
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,340
tractor!' the farmer shouted, 'He can save
her. ' But the big tractor just scared the

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:00,890
little calf. She sank deeper and deeper.
And nearby farmers began to gather

21
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:08,989
around."
Readers, I think we've come to our problem

22
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:18,590
in the story. I think the characters, Otis
and the calf, have a big problem.

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,119
Talk to your partner and see if you can
figure out what the problem is.

24
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,207
[background chatter]

25
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,880
Readers, I heard a lot of good ideas. I
heard a lot of good discussion. Miami,

26
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,740
what's the problem?

27
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
- [Inaudible]

28
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:57,050
- Who sank into the mud? The baby cow.
It's called a calf. Oh my goodness,

29
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,370
readers. I heard everybody's discussions.
You guys were all talking about the big

30
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,633
problem--the calf is stuck in the mud.
Help me write that in the problem box.

31
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,632
Here we go.

32
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:23,650
- [Together] The calf is stuck in the mud.

33
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,870
- That's our problem. The calf is stuck in
the mud. Let's see what effect this

34
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,700
problem is having on the characters in the
story. Let's see how they're feeling now.

35
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,550
It tells me where to stop to ask you guys
questions.

36
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,390
"'Call Fire Chief Douglas and the fire
truck!' the farmer shouted. 'They can save

37
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,290
our little calf. ' But the sight of the
big red fire truck startled the little

38
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,960
calf into the mud even deeper. The farmer
was fit to be tied. If the farm hands and

39
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,330
the big tractor and even Fire Chief
Douglas and his fire truck couldn't save

40
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:12,200
the little calf, who could?"
Oh my goodness. Look at everybody. What

41
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,380
effect is this problem having on the calf
and the farmer and the community? How is

42
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,540
everybody feeling? I like Amir's raised
hand. How is everybody feeling, Amir?

43
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,940
- They feel sad.

44
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,270
- Sad. I heard you say another good word
that started with W...

45
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,340
- Worried.

46
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,500
- Worried. They're sad. They're worried.
How else are they feeling? Sad, worried.

47
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,990
- Scared.

48
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,190
- Scared. Scary--what if they can't get
her out?

49
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,370
- Scary.

50
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,459
- [inaudible] ...call a lot of people.

51
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:01,350
- Yeah. They're in panic mode. They're
trying to call everyone.

52
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,050
They're panicked. Frightened.

53
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,590
- Afraid.

54
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,180
- Afraid.

55
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,550
- Worried.

56
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,510
- Worried. So, so worried.
So, so worried.

57
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,208
- They might call the other tractor.

58
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:38,370
- The big tractor can't get her out. He
already tried. Wait, Kanye, were you

59
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,664
talking about the other tractor?

60
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:43,032
- The red one.

61
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:48,300
- Oh, they might call Otis. Maybe Otis
could help. That might be a good solution

62
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,543
to the problem. Let's see what they do.
Let's find out.

63
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:11,560
"Suddenly the little calf's ears perked
up. Over the hum of the growling crowd,

64
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:18,200
there came a faint sound in the distance.
A soft, rhythmic purr, 'Put, put, puttity,

65
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:28,640
chuck. Put, Put, Puttity, chuck. Put, Put,
Puttity, chuck. ' The crowd turned and

66
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,930
looked." You hear the word chuck. Who is
coming?

67
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,200
- Otis.

68
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:40,640
- Otis. Good. Let's see what happens. "The
sound became louder. 'Put, put, puttity,

69
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,470
chuck. Put, put, puttity, chuck.'" Let's
all make Otis' sound.

70
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:51,154
- [Together] "Put, put, puttity, chuck.
Put, put, put, chuck. Put, put, puttity,

71
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,106
chuck."

72
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:58,710
- "All at once, Otis put-puffed from
around the barn. He turned and he headed

73
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,773
straight for Mud Pond."
"Otis put-puffed down the rolling hill and

74
00:08:04,773 --> 00:08:09,630
pulled right up next to the muddy waters'
edge. The calf heard her friend's

75
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:17,000
puttering purr and bawled. It was almost
like, Hello!” She's crying out to Otis.

76
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:26,770
Yeah. She bawled. "To the sound of his
gentle chuck and to the amazement of all

77
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:36,870
the people in the crowd, Otis slowly began
to circle the pond. He circled and he

78
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:46,060
circled and the little calf turned and
turned, never taking her eye off her friend."

79
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:54,110
It looks like they might be solving their

80
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,620
problem. "With each ring Otis made around
Mud Pond, the muddy grip loosened until

81
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,140
the calf was able to stumble out of the
pond on her own. The two friends had found

82
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:21,540
each other again."
It looks like we found a solution to our

83
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:32,970
problem. Talk to your partner about how
they found a solution. How did they solve

84
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,962
their problem?

85
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:38,561
[background chatter]

86
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:36,940
- I heard a lot of good discussion. How
did they solve their problem? You guys, I

87
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,950
heard everybody talking about it. So,
Jabrielle, how did they solve their

88
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:53,210
problem? What was the solution? Who came
and got her out of the mud? I heard you

89
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,108
tell Isaiah.
- Otis.

90
00:10:56,108 --> 00:11:03,550
- Otis. Ramaya, how did Otis get her out
of the mud just like Jabrielle said?

91
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:11,510
- He rided around the mud...

92
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:19,390
- Oh, I don't know if you can hear Ramaya.
She said Otis rode around Mud Pond and got

93
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,910
the calf out of the mud. Help me write
that.

94
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:34,990
- [Together] Otis rode around Mud Pond.

95
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,910
- It was called Mud Pond. Otis rode around
Mud Pond.

96
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:54,000
- [Together] And he got the calf out of
the mud.

97
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,260
- That's the solution. Now how is
everybody feeling?

98
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,330
What effect is this having? How do they
feel now that they have their problem

99
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,506
solved? Nijyah?

100
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,389
- Excited.

101
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:15,801
- Excited. Miami? Happy? Sherod.

102
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:16,962
- Glad.

103
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:35,280
- Glad. Edward? Yeah. They're feeling
great. They're reunited. Their family is

104
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:52,939
back together. Zion? How do you feel when
you solve your problem? They are a little

105
00:12:52,939 --> 00:13:04,080
exhausted, aren't they? That was a lot of
work. Ismail? They're feeling okay.

106
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:20,480
They're feeling relieved. Relieved. Wow.
Great job. Let's see how the story ends.

107
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,490
Readers, you are really doing a great job
paying attention to the problem and the

108
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,770
solution of the story. It's really helping
us comprehend the story better. We're

109
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:41,170
understanding it really well.
"Otis led the calf right down the dusty

110
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,800
road toward the village and everyone threw
flowers as they went, following them into

111
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:59,080
town. It looked like a happy parade. No
one needed a fancy-- No one needed a fancy

112
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,980
blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was
a special calf."

113
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:13,650
"Otis was a special tractor. And the two
of them were special friends. From that

114
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,500
day on, the farmer discovered that with
Otis' puttering purr beside the chicken

115
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,740
coop, his chickens laid more eggs. At
milking time, with Otis' gentle chuck

116
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:35,210
nearby, his cow produced more milk. And on
occasion, Otis even got to join the farmer

117
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:43,770
and the big yellow tractor out in the
fields. But often, at the end of the day,

118
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:51,620
Otis would just sit with his friend under
the apple tree and watch the farmer he

119
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,284
loved."
