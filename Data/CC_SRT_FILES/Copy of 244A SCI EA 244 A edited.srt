1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,829
- Dan do you have any background
knowledge about density?

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,237
- Like if someone
says, "It's dense out,"

3
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:06,033
- Yeah.

4
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:07,559
- Then it would be kinda wet.

5
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,973
- So if something's really,

6
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,689
like if there was a dense fog

7
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:11,476
- yeah, it'd be...

8
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:13,116
- So if there was a dense fog,

9
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:14,944
what does that mean to you?

10
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:16,477
- That there's a lot.

11
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:18,215
- There's a lot of it, okay.

12
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:19,806
So you're in San Francisco,
and they're like,

13
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:22,043
"Hey, there's a really dense fog."

14
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,918
You might expect that
there's a lot of fog.

15
00:00:24,028 --> 00:00:26,768
Alright, what would be the
opposite of a dense fog?

16
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:28,950
- A not dense fog.

17
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,470
- No fog or like a really thin fog.

18
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,678
Okay, Jackson, do you have
any background information?

19
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:35,712
- Well I thought that,

20
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:39,015
isn't it like how close
the molecules are together?

21
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:40,373
- How close the what?

22
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,929
- The molecules are together.

23
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,914
- How closely they are... okay.

24
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:48,321
- Yeah. Like say you're trying to go

25
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,731
through a screen door.

26
00:00:52,731 --> 00:00:56,949
And like, they aren't
really very close together,

27
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:58,100
because they'res holes.

28
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,017
- Okay.

29
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,426
- And say, you're trying
to go through a brick wall.

30
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:02,474
- Okay.

31
00:01:02,474 --> 00:01:03,794
- And they're really close together,

32
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:05,280
so it will be harder to go through.

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,662
- Would you say then, which one

34
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:12,164
would be densest, the brick
wall or the screen door?

35
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,151
- The brick wall.

36
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:14,285
- The brick wall,

37
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,105
and you would say that because?

38
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:18,379
- Because the molecules
are closer together.

39
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,283
- The molecules are closer together.

40
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:23,316
Okay, anybody else have
any ideas about density?

41
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:24,096
Yes ma'am.

42
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:26,859
- Isn't it like how compact
something is?

43
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,575
- Okay, so give me an example.

44
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:34,734
- Like um don't
know how to say this ...

45
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:37,467
kinda going back to the container thing.

46
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:40,625
If we could have luggage, and
you fill it up so much,

47
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:44,028
the luggage case is like so filled up,

48
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:47,603
it's so dense.

49
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,028
- Okay, so let me
take that to the next level.

50
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:52,208
So, let's pretend
we're going on vacation.

51
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,964
- Okay, we're going on vacation.

52
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:55,663
Raise your hand if you have
a place you want to go.

53
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:57,272
Or maybe you're going there next week.

54
00:01:57,272 --> 00:01:59,292
I'd be so jealous if you said Hawaii.

55
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,252
- Oh yeah.

56
00:02:00,482 --> 00:02:01,672
- I could be.

57
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:02,972
- Reese where are you going?

58
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:03,974
Or where would you want to go?

59
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:04,726
- Uuh, Mexico.

60
00:02:04,726 --> 00:02:06,038
- You're going to Mexico?

61
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,795
- Well not this break,
in the in the summer.

62
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:08,877
- In the summer.

63
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:10,581
Alright, so let's build this scenario.

64
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:13,959
He's got one of those
big, huge rolling bags

65
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,025
that you're gonna put
all of your swimsuits in.

66
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,733
84 swimsuits right.

67
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,736
To go to Mexico, because you
don't need other clothes.

68
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:22,062
Flip-flops, swimsuits, and
a t-shirt, and that's it.

69
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:25,405
- Okay, so you got
your huge luggage...

70
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:27,645
we're gonna pile,
all this stuff in there.

71
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:29,393
I'm gonna zip it up.

72
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:32,858
What does that have to do with density?

73
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:35,087
If it's absolutely packed full,

74
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:36,445
what does that mean
for the luggage?

75
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:37,177
Yeah.

76
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:38,763
- That the particles are

77
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:42,346
so close together that
it's leaving them in...

78
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,695
- Is the volume of the
luggage changing

79
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:48,295
if it keeps its shape?

80
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,941
- Or is, the mass of
the luggage changing,

81
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,578
because you're adding
more stuff to it.

82
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:53,547
- The mass

83
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:54,827
- So you change the mass,

84
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:56,572
because the luggage
is staying the same.

85
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:59,208
Okay, your mom says, "You
can only bring one swimsuit,

86
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,051
"one flip-flop, a pair of
flip-flops, and one t-shirt."

87
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:06,324
So I take everything out, now
did I change the volume by it,

88
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:08,355
or did I change
the mass of the luggage?

89
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,191
- The mass.

90
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,211
- I just changed the
amount of matter, right?

91
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:13,428
So then, the luggage
with tons of stuff in it,

92
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:17,514
we said was...
what dense or not dense?

93
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:18,674
- Dense

94
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:19,883
- And dense, and so the luggage

95
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,427
with a little bit of stuff in it was?

96
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:23,586
- Less dense.

97
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:26,651
- What changed the
density of the luggage?

98
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:27,893
What are the other conclusions to

99
00:03:27,893 --> 00:03:31,116
what changed the density
of the luggage?

100
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,371
Peter, what changed the
density of the luggage?

101
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:35,730
- Less amount.

102
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,222
- Less amount, and in science,

103
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:38,539
which word do we use?

104
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:41,030
- Umm

105
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,089
- Volume or mass on that one?

106
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,138
- Umm... mass.

107
00:03:45,138 --> 00:03:47,314
- Less mass, less stuff,
less matter in the luggage.

108
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:50,356
Awesome, we're gonna
do this little scenario

109
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,955
with a demonstration, so
you guys need your clickers.

110
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:57,612
it's gonna be an A or a B
type answer on this one.

111
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,714
So get your clicker ready,

112
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:01,316
and I'm gonna show you
a couple of clips.

113
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,881
- Cheese! Ooooh!

114
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,180
- Cheese.

115
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,771
- Can we eat it?

116
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:08,165
when some people in here don't like it?

117
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,218
- I know well, more for me, right.

118
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:11,658
- What?
- What?

119
00:04:11,658 --> 00:04:14,724
- Alright so, this is cheese.

120
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:17,801
This morning, I went to Safeway
and I purchased this cheese

121
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,204
that is extremely
difficult to open.

122
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:24,574
And I bought certain
kinds of cheese

123
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:25,729
- Can I have some?

124
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,307
- [Teacher] Alright. So...

125
00:04:27,307 --> 00:04:29,166
- Do we get to eat the cheese?

126
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,060
- You do not.

127
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,104
- Aww dang it!

128
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,354
- Sorry.

129
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:33,590
- Why can't we eat it?

130
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,174
- So here's your question
- [Sighs]

131
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,304
This is cheese A, okay.

132
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,810
Anybody know what kind
of cheese that it is?

133
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:43,085
- Grayson, what's cheese A?

134
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,339
- Umm... Swiss?

135
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:47,213
- Swiss, what's
your observation that

136
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,372
led you to the inference
that this is Swiss cheese?

137
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,282
- That is has the little
holes in it.

138
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,156
- The little holes in it.

139
00:04:52,156 --> 00:04:55,119
Okay, this is regular old...

140
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,281
- Cheddar

141
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,962
- Raise your hand... Yeah, Dan
know what it is?

142
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:00,234
- Cheddar or...

143
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,548
- This is a Cheddar cheese.

144
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:04,082
- Okay, So this is cheese
A, and this is cheese B.

145
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:06,618
I want to know which
cheese is denser.

146
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,618
Okay, so with your clicker,

147
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:08,936
I'm gonna put this
up on the screen,

148
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:11,754
I want to know,
cheese A the Swiss cheese,

149
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:14,699
or cheese B,

150
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:17,014
- Are they supposed to be numbers?

151
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:19,041
- Well, it's gonna be an A or a B.

152
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,367
Right so cheese A or cheese B.

153
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,690
Alright, and if you need to

154
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,385
see the cheese again, walk around.

155
00:05:24,385 --> 00:05:26,951
In the meantime, I'll
put this question up.

156
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:30,004
I want to know is cheese A the densest?

157
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:32,482
Or is cheese B the densest?

158
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:36,645
Okay, so this is
multiple-choice, A or B.

159
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:37,910
There we go, go ahead and click it.

160
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,221
And let's see what you guys think about

161
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,569
which cheese is the densest.

162
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:42,309
- So the Cheddar is B?

163
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,659
- So A is the Swiss, B is the Cheddar.

164
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,600
- That doesn't make a lot of sense.

165
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,087
- A is the Swiss...

166
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:52,373
- Are we each going
to be able to get a piece?

167
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,695
- Please don't talk
while we're doing this.

168
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:58,529
- My clicker isn't working

169
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,368
- It's not working?
Which number are you?

170
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:01,317
- 83.

171
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:02,324
- Is it on?

172
00:06:02,324 --> 00:06:03,031
- Yeah

173
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:03,735
[student laughs]

174
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:08,239
- Are you pressing the
right button, "Send?"

175
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,522
- Oh there it goes.

176
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:10,780
- Okay. good

177
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,198
- It probably didn't power.

178
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,516
- Alright, make sure
you clicked in please.

179
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,955
And then, let's look at what we think.

180
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:33,071
Okay 92% of you, said that
the cheddar was the densest.

181
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:42,027
So, we had another 8%,
so two people said

182
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,879
that this was the densest.

183
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,899
So here's what I want you to do,

184
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:47,935
I want you to pull a partner, who's just

185
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,215
the person next to you.

186
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,452
So you guys are gonna be partners,

187
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,330
you guys are partners,
you guys are partners,

188
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,712
and you're gonna be a group of three.

189
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:57,241
Partner, partner, partner
Mattie and Grayson,

190
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,374
and you guys will partner.

191
00:06:58,402 --> 00:07:01,538
Sydney and Jackson,

192
00:07:01,538 --> 00:07:02,941
and it's kinda gonna
go crossways here.

193
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:04,427
So you guys will be a partner.

194
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:06,366
You guys are a partner,
and you guys are a partner.

195
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,560
Right, you're going to
turn to your partner,

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,625
tell your partner which cheese
you thought was the densest,

197
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,329
and then I want you to
come up with a conclusion,

198
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:17,649
that you could say, "Cheese
A was the densest because..."

199
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,682
or "Cheese B was the densest because..."

200
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,527
So take 30 seconds to talk.

201
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:36,073
[Background Chatter]

202
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:37,914
- Less mass,

203
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,110
- Cheddar

204
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:41,682
- So what is the definition of density,

205
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,231
from here to the cheese?

206
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:49,186
Which one is denser, the one
with more stuff or less stuff?

207
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,085
- More

208
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:51,862
- So which of these has more stuff

209
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,742
- Ooh

210
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:56,012
- Nice of you guys, and
you're not very nice.

211

[alarm goes off]

212
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:02,270
Okay that was 30 seconds.

213
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,525
Okay, choose which person
in your group is gonna be

214
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,552
Swiss cheese, and which
person gonna be Cheddar.

215
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,513
- Swiss!

216
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,502
[Background Chatter]

217
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:12,573
- Cheddar

218
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,337
- Swiss Cheeses, raise your hand please.

219
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,499
- Woo!

220
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:20,510
- Swiss cheese?
And I need a conclusion

221
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,751
from you, so make a
statement for me. "We thought

222
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:26,998
"cheese A was the densest
because..." so Erica,

223
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:28,716
- We thought cheese B was the densest

224
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,851
because it didn't have any holes.

225
00:08:29,851 --> 00:08:32,135
- Because it didn't have any holes,
okay.

226
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,691
Does anybody have a different explanation

227
00:08:33,691 --> 00:08:37,208
why they thought cheese
B was the densest? Matt.

228
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:41,239
- Well, because cheese
A had holes, the holes

229
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:44,686
don't take in the part of the, technical

230
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:46,044
isn't part of the cheese.

231
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:46,799
- Okay

232
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,658
- So...

233
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,095
- So the inside of the holes,

234
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,978
what are the holes
actually made up of?

235
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,023
- Air.

236
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:55,518
- So there's air in there, but
it's not part of the cheese.

237
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:59,581
So then, what's true about
the Swiss cheese then Reily?

238
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,997
- It has the less cheese.

239
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:03,865
- Less cheese, compared to its what?

240
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:06,772
- Compared to has all of it.

241
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:09,541
- So it's all cheese
and this is part cheese.

242
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,071
What can we say now
about their volumes?

243
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:15,903
- Umm, they're pretty
much the same.

244
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:19,153
- Okay, so the volume
is the same.

245
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:21,824
Jackson, what can we say
about the mass of the Swiss

246
00:09:21,824 --> 00:09:24,029
compared to the mass of this guy?

247
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,524
- The Swiss has less
mass than the Cheddar cheese.

248
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:30,646
- So the Swiss has
less mass then the Cheddar.

249
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:33,931
But they have the same
volume, can we figure out then

250
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,016
which one's the densest?

251
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,117
Which one's the densest?

[girls singing]

253
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:41,599
- What's both, alright.

254
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:44,073
You had a chance to talk
about it, let's vote again.

255
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,716
Do you think cheese A is the densest

256
00:09:47,716 --> 00:09:50,947
or cheese B is the densest?

257
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,832
After our little discussion.

258
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:55,184
Cheese A or cheese B.

259
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:58,387
A is the Swiss, B is the Cheddar.

260
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,797
- So we want to know
who's more dense

261
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:02,956
- More dense yep,

262
00:10:02,956 --> 00:10:03,757
Which one is more dense.

263
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:05,057
More dense.

264
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,531
Is A more dense or is B more dense?

265
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:17,135
Let's see if we get an
agreement on our inference here

266
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:18,313
about which one's denser.

267
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,613
Look at that, we were able
to change two people's minds

268
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:25,122
just through discussion.

269
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:26,091
That's pretty awesome.

270
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,360
- I thought it would
be eight people.

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,131
- Well we went all the way
to 100% here.

272
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,076
So that's good. That means
that everybody agreed,

273
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:33,730
at least in terms of the cheese.

274
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,939
So, as a demonstration...
- What!

275
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:39,854
- Well I need a snack,

276
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,514
this is really hard work
being a teacher.

277
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:43,639
- It's hard to be a student.

278
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,939
- That's true.

279
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:47,574
Okay, ready for demo number two?

280
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:48,294
- Yeah

281
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:52,554
- So cheese number one, number two,

282
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,980
first we need to talk about, what

283
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,976
sinking, floating,
and suspending means.

284
00:10:57,976 --> 00:10:58,870
- I know it

285
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:03,780
- So in order to talk about
this, I have these fun objects.

286
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,417
I don't know, has anybody
stayed up late enough

287
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:06,474
to see David Letterman?

288
00:11:06,474 --> 00:11:07,378
- Yes!

289
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:09,016
- Oh gosh, I lost an animal.

290
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:10,037
[students laugh]

291
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,954
has anybody on David Letterman ever seen

292
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:15,389
the game show he plays
called, "Will it float?"

293
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,013
- Yeah, I've seen it happen.

294
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,277
- Have you Wyatt?
What does he do?

295
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:21,310
Do you know what he does?

296
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,272
- Well I saw it a while ago,
so I don't relaly remember.

297
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,711
- So you're not really sure?

298
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:26,894
Anybody wanna guess what
he does on the show?

299
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,467
- He throws stuff in water.

300
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,993
- He takes some stuff,

301
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:34,173
then he puts it in water to
sees if it floats or not.

302
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:37,237
- That's pretty much the gist
of the game show.

303
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,513
So I have, for your viewing pleasure,

304
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:42,356
recreated a game show.

305
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:46,315
So I have objects, we're
gonna play a game called,

306
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:47,174
"Will it float?"

307
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,811
And the first object, you're going to

308
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:50,251
predict this through the clicker.

309
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,095
Is I wanna know, if our
little dolphin friend,

310
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:58,095
is it going to float... okay

311
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,738
sink...

312
00:12:02,986 --> 00:12:05,076
or the third option which is tricky,

313
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:08,395
you might not know this word, suspend.

314
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,068
And suspends means hang out

315
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,839
kinda in the middle of the water.

316
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,160
So you have three options, alright.

317
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,706
We're gonna vote on
this with the clickers.

318
00:12:15,706 --> 00:12:17,140
Do you have a question
before we do that?

319
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,721
- When you put it to the test,

320
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,901
can I move forward?

321
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,491
- Absolutely, so if you can't see,

322
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,391
you can either stand up or you
can squeeze up into an aisle,

323
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,785
yeah absolutely.

324
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:27,457
Yes sir.

325
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,024
- Which one is it, A, B , or C?

326
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,935
- Oh I'm gonna tell you
right now, okay.

327
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:33,309
So we're gonna see
if the dolphin floats,

328
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:34,748
sinks, or suspends.

329
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:36,083
And if you can't see when I do it,

330
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,311
we'll count and you
can stand up and watch.

331
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:44,311
So A is gonna be sink, so do
you think it's gonna sink.

332
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,220
B, answer B will be float.

333
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:50,856
C will be suspend,

334
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:56,468
Okay, so sink, float, suspend which means

335
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,274
hang out in the middle of the water.

336
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,337
Okay, so this is an A through C option.

337
00:13:03,969 --> 00:13:08,969
Okay, A sink, B float, or C suspend.

338
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:19,356
- Well that was fast.

339
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:20,576
- Yeah, that was really fast.

340
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:24,963
So let's see... everyone...oooo

341
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,735
84% say that this particular
object is going to sink.

342
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:32,822
If it sinks, what will you observe?

343
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,010
If it sinks, what will you observe.

344
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,171
- How fast.

345
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:37,639
- It falling into the water

346
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,417
- Well, he's going to fall into the water

347
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:40,954
one way or another but
where will he end up?

348
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,057
- On the bottom.

349
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:44,769
- At the bottom of that okay?

350
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,396
Some of you, one person
said that it's gonna float.

351
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:50,857
Okay, so raise your hand if
you're the person who thinks

352
00:13:50,857 --> 00:13:52,098
it's gonna float.

353
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,258
Okay, thank you for taking
a risk, that's okay.

354
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:56,453
You don't know yet right,
it's for fun.

355
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:58,706
So if its floating,
what will that mean,

356
00:13:58,706 --> 00:14:00,389
what will you observe?

357
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:01,740
- That's she right.

358
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,451
- When I put this in the water,

359
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:06,676
what will it look like
when it's floating?

360
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:10,900
- Like... I don't know

361
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,844
- Will it will be sitting
on the bottom?

362
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:13,756
- No.

363
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:15,148
- Where will it be located.

364
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:16,366
- Floating on the.

365
00:14:16,366 --> 00:14:18,244
- Floating, right on the top, okay.

366
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:20,986
And then we had, oooooh three
whole people said it would

367
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,901
suspend right in the middle.

368
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:24,607
Raise your hand if you
think it's gonna suspend.

369
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,349
- Oh yeah!

370
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:28,427
- Okay.  Leia, why do you think

371
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:30,331
it's gonna go right in the middle.

372
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:35,091
- I think it's too light
for it to totally sink,

373
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,401
and I think it's took
heavy for it to float,

374
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:38,968
so thought it would be
right in the middle.

375
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,430
- Okay, so you're making the

376
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,699
hypothesis it has something
to do with its weight.

377
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:47,519
Okay, alright so that's one idea.

378
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:50,368
Too light to stay at the top.

379
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:51,888
But too heavy would go to the bottom.

380
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:52,922
Is that what you said?

381
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:54,385
Okay, yes.

382
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:55,685
- So does suspend mean

383
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,230
it stays in the middle.

384
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,025
- Yeah, suspend means it
literally hangs out right here.

385
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,486
- Yeah.

386
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,949
- Okay, that's not true.

387
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:06,306
- Okay, are you guys ready?
- Yes.

388
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,929
- So stand up if you need
to be able to see.

389
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:11,508
Here's the game show,
there's a little song

390
00:15:11,508 --> 00:15:12,948
that goes with it like,

391
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:14,549
♫ Will it float, will it float ♫

392
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,776
Okay, there's my game show, you ready?

393
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:17,882
Alright it's very suspenseful.

394
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:18,728
Can you see?

395
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,249
- Okay, here it goes.

396
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,520
[kids singing]

397
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:26,020
- Yes!

398
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,680
- Aww yeah!
[students clapping]

399
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,377
- So, it sank.

400
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,065
So go back and have a seat please.

401
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,747
Now raise your hand if
you have any explanation

402
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:37,019
for me why that sank.

403
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:40,409
It did sink, oh no!

404
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,290
We've all been down to
the bottom of the pool.

405
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,809
Why do you think it sank?

406
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,215
- I thought it wasn't flat enough,

407
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,711
or didn't have enough
space enough to float up.

408
00:15:49,711 --> 00:15:51,835
- So now we've got two different ideas

409
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:53,508
about sinking and foating.

410
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:56,038
So Leia brought up the
idea of heaviness,

411
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,031
you brought up the
idea of surface area.

412
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:01,970
See if I were to put something that has

413
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,827
a bigger surface area, is it gonna float?

414
00:16:03,827 --> 00:16:05,813
- No
- Yes

415
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:11,081
- Maybe, did you tell me
that if it had bigger surface

416
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,103
on top of the water.

417
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:13,333
Okay, should we try this?

418
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,703
- Yeah!

419
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:15,922
- It's gonna sink

420
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:16,955
- Oooh

421
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:18,256
- Okay, so maybe

422
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:20,577
- Aaaaw

423
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:21,993
- It got swamped.

424
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,200
Now it floated for a little while right?

425
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,916
So maybe the shape does have
something to do with it,

426
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,900
and maybe weight has
something to do with it.

427
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,022
Or what it's made out of might
have something to do with it.

428
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,542
So we have all kinds of ideas now

429
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,248
about sinking and floating.

430
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:37,019
Yes sir,

431
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,548
- Is it because

432
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:39,488
it's denser than water?

433
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:41,670
- So here's another idea,
it has something to do

434
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,529
with the density of the object.

435
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:44,854
- It's denser than water.

436
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,907
- So here's a tough question,
so think about this one.

437
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:51,907
What is the difference between
how dense something is,

438
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,735
and how heavy something is?

439
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:58,406
If Leia talked about heaviness,

440
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,939
now we've got density,
and now we've got shape,

441
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,274
and what it's made of and all
these different things so.

442
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,493
I just want to know this one thing.

443
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:07,369
What's the difference between
the weight of an object

444
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,216
and the density of an object.

445
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:14,591
This is a really hard
question, take a second.

446
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:21,539
I want you to rotate
back to your partner,

447
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,442
talk to them about what
you think the difference

448
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,102
between density and weight is.

449
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:55,474
[Background Chatter]

450
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,163
- Okay, when we talked
about number of particles,

451
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,794
it's later than mass.
- Mass.

452
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:03,958
- Mass, so the relationship between

453
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,861
mass compared to the object.

454
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:13,225
Okay.

455
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,604
Okay who spoke last time,

456
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:20,959
'cause I need a cheddar.

457
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,164
[Background Chatter]

458
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:25,440
- Oh yeah

459
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:29,461
- A cheddar who's willing to talk.

460
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,353
Emily, what did you guys come up with?

461
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:35,579
- So, density is like
how much mass or

462
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:37,575
how many particles are in the object.

463
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,035
And weight is how much
gravity is pulling down.

464
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:45,433
- Okay.  So would that
mean that something...
