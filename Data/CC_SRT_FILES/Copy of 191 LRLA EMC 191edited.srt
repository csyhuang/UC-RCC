1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:01,965
- [Teacher] I teach in
a second and third grade

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:03,367
combination class.

3
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:06,069
The students are arranged
in grade-level specific

4
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:07,592
table groupings.

5
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:09,483
This allows students to
complete any grade-level

6
00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:12,368
specific projects together
and receive instructions

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,988
in a manner that's clear to them.

8
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:17,630
I also have a guided reading area.

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,023
And a independent reading corner.

10
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:23,013
All of the resources the students may need

11
00:00:23,013 --> 00:00:25,696
are located around the
perimeter of the classroom

12
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:29,897
leaving access to the
center of the classroom,

13
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,128
the large rug area for all
of our class discussions

14
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:34,428
to take place.

15
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,318
As well as collaborative group work.

16
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:40,645
Students also have available
to them the reading corner

17
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:43,632
area as an area for
collaborative group work.

18
00:00:43,632 --> 00:00:45,460
They have a listening
center where they access

19
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,776
books on tape and CD.

20
00:00:47,776 --> 00:00:50,621
We have three computer
stations where children

21
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,486
word process completed writing projects,

22
00:00:53,486 --> 00:01:00,040
or they do research on the internet.

23
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,815
But complete sentence,
okay for that first part.

24
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,244
All right, and then
someone who's taking turns.

25
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:11,134
So we're clear on the rubric
what my expectation is

26
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:12,718
when we walk around.

27
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:15,420
Questions?

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,294
- If they make a mistake,

29
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:21,048
do you want us to correct
their English or (inaudible)?

30
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,193
- You know what, what I think
is a nice way to correct

31
00:01:25,193 --> 00:01:28,159
someone when they misspeak,
and I do this a lot,

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,202
so you might notice that I
restate what someone has said.

33
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:34,984
And that's part of being a good listener.

34
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:37,849
So, being able to recall or restate.

35
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,994
Something like, oh, I heard you say,

36
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:44,655
and then you restate it
in the way that might be

37
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:46,078
more appropriate.

38
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,353
That's a respectful
way of being a listener

39
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:50,259
and also a speaker when
you're trying to teach

40
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,945
and be a role model.

41
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,033
- I have a different idea, I think that is.

42
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,287
- Okay, so there's another way,

43
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:59,111
"I think that is," excellent.

44
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:02,341
So we're going to just try
this out and see how it goes.

45
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,190
We're going to try this out again,

46
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,730
and practice those cues.

47
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,375
- Are we the
same number as usual?

48
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,509
- Yeah, okay so here we go.

49
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,281
We're going to practice.

50
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,764
When you get to your pictures,

51
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:14,511
this is what I want you to do.

52
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:19,773
Right now, I have put, I
have this image of a whale

53
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,755
on, okay can you have a seat?

54
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:29,607
I need everyone sitting next
to their partners right now.

55
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,650
So what I want you to do
is, looking at this picture,

56
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,961
I want you to practice
right now in your group

57
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,497
sharing one or two things that you notice

58
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:41,655
in this picture.

59
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:42,488
What do you see?

60
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:45,881
So I want you to share
exactly physical features,

61
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:50,452
and use descriptive language
to talk about what you see.

62
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:51,886
Question?

63
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:55,892
(inaudible)

64
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,613
Hold on a second, sweetie,
I just called on Jonathan.

65
00:02:58,613 --> 00:02:59,466
Just a second.

66
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:00,951
Question?

67
00:03:00,951 --> 00:03:03,835
(inaudible)

68
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,969
- We're going to describe
with our partner.

69
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,594
So you're going to need
to turn to your partner.

70
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:08,610
Adam what did you?

71
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,414
- I don't really understand what that thing

72
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,896
in black is.

73
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:14,582
- You know, it's just a shadow.

74
00:03:14,582 --> 00:03:15,273
It's a shadow.

75
00:03:15,273 --> 00:03:16,290
This one?

76
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,178
It's just a shadow on the picture.

77
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:22,953
It just doesn't look very
clear the way it came out.

78
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,733
It's the shadow on the image, okay?

79
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:30,654
All right, so turn to your partner.

80
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:33,538
When I ring the bell,
number ones share first.

81
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:36,118
When I ring the bell, number twos share.

82
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:37,867
When I ring the bell,
I'm going to take some of

83
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:42,714
your descriptive language.

84
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:43,811
Sharing what you see.

85
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,192
(bell ringing)

86
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:59,069
(background chatter)

87
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,979
(bell ringing)

88
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,177
- Number twos.

89
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:18,715
(background chatter)

90
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:22,860
(bell ringing)

91
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,070
- Okay, excellent.

92
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,163
So I'm going to pick a stick.

93
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,011
I'm going to go fishing in my sticks.

94
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,425
And when I call your
name I want you to share

95
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:38,381
either what you saw, or
what your partner saw, okay?

96
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:40,697
What was the detail that was shared?

97
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,543
And I'm going to write
it up on this sticky note

98
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:46,021
because I'm modeling now
what you're going to do

99
00:04:46,021 --> 00:04:50,185
when you get to your stations.

100
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:52,949
Everyone's going to get
a stack of sticky notes

101
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:55,630
and you're going to get an
opportunity after you share

102
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,857
to record some of your
ideas of what you see.

103
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:03,838
Number 10, Cesar.

104
00:05:03,838 --> 00:05:06,683
(inaudible)

105
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:09,011
Sorry?

106
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,702
You want to ask a question?

107
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,058
For a clarifying question?

108
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:15,090
- No, I was just making a comment.

109
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,995
Just I don't like it when there's only

110
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:22,445
like one sticky note for everyone.

111
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:27,768
Because then the first
group who goes there

112
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:31,770
puts like every single
little thing that they see.

113
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,484
And it takes up like maybe three-quarters

114
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,170
of the whole paper.

115
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,868
And then the next group
has like (inaudible).

116
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,961
- Okay, so we're going
to solve that problem,

117
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:48,532
because each individual
gets a sticky note, okay?

118
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:51,254
And then you're going to choose
where you're going to put it.

119
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:55,704
All right, so number 10, Cesar.

120
00:05:55,704 --> 00:06:00,133
- [Cesar] Madelaine said that she saw

121
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:05,111
white spots and one on the bottom.

122
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:13,266
And she said an Orca,

123
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:18,895
and she saw

124
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:24,823
a very long tongue and sharp teeth.

125
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:28,183
- [Teacher] She actually named the animal,

126
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,381
which was an Orca.

127
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,454
She saw white spots on the bottom.

128
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:33,728
And what was the part about the teeth?

129
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:39,000
- (inaudible) and a few sharp teeth.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,201
(background chatter)

131
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:46,535
- Oh sorry, and then sharp teeth.

132
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:52,493
Okay, so I wrote more than
one idea on this sticky note.

133
00:06:52,493 --> 00:06:54,831
But what you're going to do is after we do

134
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,609
the conversation, after we
walk through the stations

135
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:03,078
and see the images and talk about it,

136
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:07,832
then you're going to go
back and record one idea

137
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,864
on the sticky note.

138
00:07:09,864 --> 00:07:12,364
And put it onto the picture.

139
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,956
So let's try one more.

140
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:18,811
I'm going to turn it over.

141
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,941
So look at the picture,
and then I'm going to

142
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,334
ring the bell, you're going to share,

143
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:31,733
and I'll pick somebody else
to share what they see.

144
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:32,557
(bell ringing)

145
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:46,312
(background chatter)

146
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,100
(bell ringing)

147
00:07:48,100 --> 00:08:06,242
(background chatter)

148
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:13,720
(bell ringing)

149
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,856
- [Teacher] Okay, so who's
next, number 21, Roberto.

150
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:23,817
- My partner says, oh what I said?

151
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:24,548
- [Teacher] It can be what you said

152
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,214
or what your partner
said, whatever you decide.

153
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,250
His was good?

154
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:34,219
- I said that I see a pod
of Orca whales and their

155
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:49,088
dorsal fins sticking up out of the water.

156
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,631
- [Teacher] That was great.

157
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,553
So he has two points, that he sees the pod

158
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:56,787
which is how we refer to,

159
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:57,783
- [Students] A group.

160
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:01,988
- [Teacher] A group, excellent
use of the vocabulary.

161
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:06,809
The Orca whale, so he's named
the actual type of whale.

162
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,017
And he starts looking at the dorsal fins,

163
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,535
which is one of the physical features.

164
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:18,366
Not only of the Orca, but of what?

165
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,281
- The humpback doesn't.

166
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:22,471
- The humpback, that's right
it doesn't have a dorsal fin.

167
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,461
So which ones have the dorsal fin?

168
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,371
- All the others
ones except for that one.

169
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,687
(background chatter)

170
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,251
- [Teacher] There's a couple
of other ones as well.

171
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:31,511
- Blue whales don't.

172
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:34,295
- [Teacher] Blue whales,
good, good, good, good, good.

173
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:36,673
Eyes up here.

174
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:39,112
Are there any questions
on what I want you to do

175
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,934
when you go around to
the different stations?

176
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:42,726
Yes, Sarah.

177
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:44,108
- So how many sticky
notes are we going to get?

178
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,815
Like a couple, four or five?

179
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:47,115
- So, first I'm going to give you a chance

180
00:09:47,115 --> 00:09:48,577
to walk around.

181
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,919
And then I'm going to
come around and I'm going

182
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,178
to give you some sticky notes.

183
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:51,829
- [Sarah] So you're going
to let us look at them

184
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,596
and then we're going to
pick which one we want

185
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:54,652
and put a sticky note on?

186
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:55,831
- Yes, exactly, exactly.

187
00:09:55,831 --> 00:10:34,151
(background chatter)

188
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:36,466
- What's this?

189
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,946
This one's cool.

190
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:46,928
I see, some baleen,

191
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:49,654
which means it's a baleen whale.

192
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:55,911
And it looks like it has a big mouth.

193
00:10:55,911 --> 00:11:00,889
And the baleen looks like it is,

194
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,181
some sort of bendy thing.

195
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:08,813
And on the bottom of
the baleen it's scary.

196
00:11:08,813 --> 00:11:11,616
And it looks like it has
a big mouth which probably

197
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:16,202
means it is a very big baleen whale.

198
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:21,031
- I see a baleen whale with
a lot of crushed thingies.

199
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:27,467
And a person's touching it.

200
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,332
I'm not sure if it's a
real whale that's alive.

201
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:32,444
It might just be an exhibit.

202
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,746
- No, Jake.

203
00:11:33,746 --> 00:11:38,482
- And (inaudible), so I don't really think

204
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:41,445
this is something that's underwater.

205
00:11:41,445 --> 00:12:11,310
(background chatter)

206
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,342
- It's part of baleen.

207
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:17,750
It's like a baleen whale,
there's baleen, but.

208
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:32,561
(background chatter)

209
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,893
- [Boy] It looks like a Blue
Whale, because it is very big.

210
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:42,253
It also doesn't have any throat looms.

211
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:47,841
and it has just a small bump
for it's dorsal (inaudible).

212
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:52,492
It also looks like it's
swimming very close to the top.

213
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:56,840
And that also looks like
it's coming up for air.

214
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:03,897
(background chatter)

215
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:08,398
- I see a whale

216
00:13:08,398 --> 00:13:15,866
that a man is touching their teeth.

217
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,345
- I'm not exactly sure
what type of whale this is,

218
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:23,810
but it's a whale.

219
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,350
- I see someone touching part of a whale,

220
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:48,589
and it might be part
of a baleen (inaudible).

221
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,682
I see a whale and I think it's coming

222
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:56,381
to the surface for a
breath because they cannot

223
00:13:56,381 --> 00:14:00,485
breathe under water.

224
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:03,268
- I think that that is
a baleen whale because

225
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:07,607
it is, it is white

226
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,411
and it's a little bit gray.

227
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:42,288
((background chatter)

228
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:44,055
- I see a whale that is going up

229
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:47,651
to the surface of the water, and I believe

230
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:50,476
that it's a beluga whale.

231
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:54,107
- I see the whale.

232
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:59,334
I think it's going to jump out the water,

233
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:04,162
and then dive (inaudible).

234
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:09,281
- I see a big, gigantic, beluga whale

235
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:16,271
with his skin has a couple
like dents and wrinkles.

236
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:21,271
- And it doesn't have a dorsal fin.
