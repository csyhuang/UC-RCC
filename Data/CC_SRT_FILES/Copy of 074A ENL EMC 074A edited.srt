1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,241
- (Background Chatter)

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,441
- [Teacher] So how would you describe that?

3
00:00:07,821 --> 00:00:12,714
-(Background Chatter)

4
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,831
- [Teacher] Can you find the exact 
spot where that is in the text

5
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:26,392
where you can find those?

6
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:28,150
So you basically have
found two character traits

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,871
to describe to me, right?

8
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:32,551
You guys have discovered
that he can be what?

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,990
What was one of them again?

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,470
- [Students] Jealous. Sad.
- [Teacher] Jealous. Or sad.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,790
So I want you to find that evidence.

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,991
If you want to make those claims,

13
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:40,584
any of those are great ideas.

14
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:42,831
But now you have to dig a
little bit deeper into the text

15
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,191
and see if you can find this.

16
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,991
Can you find examples and see?

17
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,784
OK. Keep sharing.

18
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:49,521
You're doing a great job!

19
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,361
- [Girl 1] Toby wanted to play...

20
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:58,402
- [Girl 2] Because Toby was kinda jealous

21
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,561
because Bouncer

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,111
was outside by himself.

23
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:08,360
Didn't want to (Background Chatter).

24
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:13,361
Nobody didn't... and a little kid

25
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:17,487
wanted to go outside the house.

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,121
Well, I think he's thinking this himself.

27
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:29,001
Because he was thinking about what

28
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,360
the other (Background Chatter).

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,630
- [Girl 1] That's Toby.

30
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,961
- [Girl 2] So, he's kinda jealous

31
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:40,761
because he's talking

32
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,082
to the other little dog,

33
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,790
and every single time,

34
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,401
he wants to play ball with him.

35
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:51,351
But he doesn't want to (Background Chatter).

36
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,681
- [Boy] And the thing is, the lady said it,

37
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,761
in the story,

38
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:05,591
it made it sadder

39
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:11,011
than it usually would be sad.

40
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:17,201
That sometimes the stories
make it seem so sad,

41
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:20,581
so good that that can feel.

42
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,351
So, here where it says,

43
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:34,362
"Why does Andy need a new dog?"

44
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:36,040
Oh, wait.

45
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:45,073
"'Why does Andy need a
new dog?' wondered Toby.

46
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,881
"He already has me.

47
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:50,801
"Toby sighed and laid down

48
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:53,481
"Beside the dog.

49
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:56,121
"Maybe Andy doesn't love me anymore."

50
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,200
They had to make it

51
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:08,321
so that what happened,

52
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:12,720
and actually it's sad what happened.

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,240
It's not that it's sad,
but it's not so so sad,

54
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:20,954
but they make it like sad.

55
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:36,561
- [Girl 1] Toby wanted... (Background Chatter)

56
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,521
- [Boy] Toby wanted to play ball

57
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,561
and he got a new dog

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,961
and forgot, I was about to...

59
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,881
(Background Chatter)

60
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:56,041
- [Boy] Well, he didn't really forget about Toby,

61
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,291
because he still bought Toby his food.

62
00:04:07,482 --> 00:04:09,961
I know!

63
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:12,481
Toby wanted to play ball,

64
00:04:16,351 --> 00:04:18,921
but when Andy came,

65
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,160
he got a new dog.

66
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,520
And then, for the rest of the day,

67
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:32,240
Andy was playing with his new dog.

68
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:36,881
And Toby felt left out.

69
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,121
I say we put 'left out' somewhere.

70
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,321
- [Girl 1] He's so sad, jealous, and left out.

71
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,441
- [Boy] So, Toby wanted to play ball

72
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:54,161
with Andy,

73
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:59,161
but when Andy...

74
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:02,881
- [Girl 1] How do you spell Andy?

75
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,321
- [Boy] A-N-D-Y

76
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,120
- [Girl 1] Andy.
- [Boy] Andy.

77
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,681
- [Girl 1] Where do you see?

78
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,361
- [Girl 2] Oh, yeah.

79
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:14,920
- [Boy] When Andy told him
he wanted to play ball,

80
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:23,601
- [Girl 1] Where are you?

81
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:25,721
- [Boy] Andy.
- [Girl 1] Andy.

82
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:31,601
- [Boy] Toby wanted to play ball,

83
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:32,991
but when Andy came,

84
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:35,440
he had a new dog.

85
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:39,441
And you spelled with a silent (Background Chatter)

86
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,121
- [Girl 1] I think with the Andy...

87
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,121
- [Girl 2] Another dog?

88
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,601
- [Girl 1] A new... Like this one.

89
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:53,201
- [Girl 2] Another dog.

90
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:56,920
- [Boy] No, it's not. Well, whatever.

91
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,591
Who wants to... (Background Chatter)

92
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:26,081
(Background Chatter)

93
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,842
- [Girl] Just write. Just write!

94
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,401
- [Boy 1] I put 'Toby was jealous
because of Bouncer.'

95
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,481
Maybe we can put, because

96
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,641
he wanted more attention.

97
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:02,151
- [Girl] That's how my sister is.

98
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:04,991
She wants more attention.

99
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,831
- [Boy 1] We're not talking about your sister.

100
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:09,102
We're talking about Toby.

101
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:12,469
- [Boy 2] So, Toby was jealous...

102
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,081
- [Boy 1] Toby was jealous because a dog's there.

103
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:22,961
- [Girl] Because Toby was a dog

104
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,681
and Bouncer just came along

105
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,441
and he didn't like him.

106
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:34,434
He's jealous.

107
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:37,121
- [Boy 2] No. We have to write a
reason why he's jealous.

108
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:40,321
- [Girl] I know! Then we have
to do part of the test.

109
00:07:44,461 --> 00:07:46,201
Part of the test!

110
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,921
- [Teacher] Did you guys
agree on a character trait

111
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:55,241
that he was at the beginning?

112
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,481
- [Girl] Jealous.
- [Boys] Jealous.

113
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,402
- [Teacher] Jealous?

114
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:58,641
Do you have at least one example,

115
00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:00,721
and maybe two?

116
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:03,361
Do you have an example, Joaquin?

117
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:08,081
- [Boy 1] I'm going to put Toby
wanted more attention,

118
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,391
but Bouncer got more attention.

119
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:13,681
- [Teacher] Do you have an example 
of why he wanted more attention?

120
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:14,830
- [Girl] I have one.

121
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,400
- [Teacher] Can you find it, Oscar?

122
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,321
- [Boy 1] When he was, like, maybe Bouncer

123
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:22,631
doesn't love him anymore.

124
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:24,544
- [Teacher] I only said that. Can you find that?

125
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:25,241
So when you write it,

126
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:26,552
when you explain it,

127
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:27,951
can you find that part and maybe quote it?

128
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,836
- [Girl] There's another reason...

129
00:08:29,836 --> 00:08:34,361
When they came through the driveway,

130
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,720
he got all (Background Chatter).

131
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,061
And then when he came back, he lay...

132
00:08:40,874 --> 00:08:45,874
(Background Chatter)

133
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,521
- [Teacher] So that's
like too many things.

134
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,193
- [Boy 2] Toby was jealous, cuz

135
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,922
- [Boy 2] Toby was jealous, cuz Bouncer

136
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,042
got more attention, instead of Toby.

137
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:20,601
- [Girl] No.

138
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,201
- [Boy 2] Yeah.

139
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,041
- [Boy 1] Oh, right here.

140
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,312
- [Boy 2] In the middle.

141
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:27,041
- [Boy 1] Toby, since nobody...

142
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,641
- [Girl] What paragraph is that?

143
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:31,800
- [Boy 1] Paragraph nine.

144
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,681
He wondered if Andy had forgotten

145
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,161
all about him.

146
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,922
- [Girl] Do you know why he paid
more attention to Bouncer?

147
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,321
Because he's a little puppy.

148
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:49,561
And little puppies need more attention

149
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,081
than big puppies.
- [Boy 2] Because little puppies

150
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:53,281
don't know what to do.

151
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:55,481
- [Girl] I know. And they're not even trained.

152
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:58,371
They have to train them more.

153
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:02,361
- [Boy 2] For like three months.

154
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:05,761
- [Girl] Yes. That's why he needs more attention

155
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:07,241
than Bouncer, yeah.

156
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:11,441
- [Boy 2] Toby needed...

157
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:13,081
Because Toby really knows how to...

158
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:19,441
- [Girl] And he knows, that's an old dog.

159
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,801
And you can see all the wrinkles.

160
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,432
- [Boy 2] That's how the dogs are.

161
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:26,271
Yeah, those dogs have wrinkles

162
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:29,351
when they're big already.

163
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:30,431
But they're still young.

164
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:31,361
- [Girl] OK.

165
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,081
- [Boy 2] Toby was jealous because Bouncer...

166
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,361
- [Girl] What did you write?

167
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:41,360
- [Boy 2] So. I have, 'In the
beginning was Toby..."

168
00:10:42,630 --> 00:11:22,961
(Background Chatter)

169
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:26,631
- [Girl 1] When Andy had a puppy,

170
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:31,631
he liked Bouncer more than Toby.

171
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,200
- [Girl 3] Maybe.

172
00:11:36,551 --> 00:11:40,842
- [Girl 1] And in the beginning, Andy was showing

173
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,271
the puppy opening.

174
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,921
Opening the puppy, and showing it to Toby.

175
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:50,202
- [Girl 3] Yes.

176
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:56,481
- [Girl 1] That's how he was like nervous.

177
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:58,121
- [Girl 3] Jealous.

178
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:58,961
- [Girl 1] Yeah, jealous.

179
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:01,281
- [Girl 3] And selfish.

180
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:02,482
- [Girl 1] Yeah.

181
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,000
That's what I put in the beginning.

182
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:09,881
And then Toby...

183
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,441
Remember the part when
he got the little ball?

184
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,520
- [Girl 2] Right

185
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,401
- [Girl 1] Yeah, and he was being jealous.

186
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:25,401
- [Girl 3] Yeah.

187
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,961
- [Girl 1] ...Bouncer. Because he was a new one.

188
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,202
And the old one was Toby.

189
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,161
- [Girl 3] And the part

190
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:40,601
when Andy closed the door

191
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:44,441
in Toby's face,

192
00:12:44,991 --> 00:12:46,961
and he let him outside.

193
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:49,480
Then he felt loner.

194
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:02,761
- [Girl 2] I believe that,

195
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:07,041
Toby was getting (Background Chatter) Bouncer.

196
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,401
Because they would stay together,

197
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,281
and they slept the whole night together.

198
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:20,081
- [Girl 1] So they were being friendly.

199
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:22,161
- [Girl 2] Yeah, like starting to.
- [Girl 3] Yeah.

200
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:31,281
[Girl 1] Another thing that Bouncer was new.

201
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:37,201
And another thing, Toby was old.

202
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:43,240
So, Andy was used to Bouncer...

203
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,801
- [Girl 3] And Bouncer and Toby...

204
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:51,802
(Background Chatter)

205
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:57,042
- [Girl 1] And that's I think what Toby about.

206
00:13:57,831 --> 00:13:59,041
It's Bouncer.

207
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:04,601
You know how the fence
went to (Background Chatter) Bouncer.

208
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:08,241
They get a kinda middle-something.

209
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:09,561
- [Girl 3] Yeah.

210
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,202
- [Girl 1] That's what I think.

211
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:20,282
- [Girl 2] When they started to get 
(Background Chatter),

212
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:29,631
Toby showed Bouncer how to catch the ball,

213
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,521
that's when they started to become friends.
