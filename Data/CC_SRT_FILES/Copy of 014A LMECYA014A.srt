1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
- We are entertaining using second person
stories. Last time we were together, we

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,220
started a story here today called Aliens
in the Library. You saw that I put my name

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,730
up here on the line, and it says Aliens in
the Library. The introduction page is the

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,430
part where I underlined those 'you's. Did you
notice how these 'you's are underlined over

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,461
and over again? The reason is because we
don't typically write like this.

6
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:26,928
This is kind of unfamiliar for us.

7
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:31,530
We had fun making the beginning of this
story. We only wrote half of the story

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,125
using this graphic organizer. Do we
remember why we only wrote half of the story?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,521
Why did we only write this
side of the story?

10
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,290
- Because that was, like the one story
[Inaudible]

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,510
- Right. There are two main things that
you can choose from. If you look up here

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,320
at the board, everybody should be looking
up here, you can see that there are two

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,330
choices for each one. You have your
introduction and you have your two

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,020
choices. We only did this half of the
story, so right now we're going to hide

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,940
the other half because we're not even
thinking about it yet.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,860
So the story was that you're in the
library, you hear a noise like, what did

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,960
we say, rats in a blender? And so you go
out to investigate what the story was.

18
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,270
Now, that's the coolest part about this
project guys. The reason we are making our

19
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,450
own stories rather than me grabbing the
book from a shelf and copying it on here

20
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,280
is because we want to use information in
our own way. What's that called when you

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,460
take someone else's information and put it
on a piece of paper? What's that called?

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,170
Who can remember what that's called?
What's that called?

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,430
- Copyright infringement.

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,730
- Copyright infringement, or there's
another big 'p' word, too, that we talked

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,952
about. That's a tough one, do you remember
what that one is?

26
00:01:43,952 --> 00:01:45,510
- Plagiarism.

27
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,910
- Plagiarism. And if you take a story of
someone else's and stick it on there, it's

28
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:59,290
a problem. And so, when you have a story
in your mind you want to make sure that it

29
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,210
is your story and your story alone. The
best way for me to describe this is, right

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:10,330
now for reading team we designed our own
t-shirts for a t-shirt contest. Maybe your

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,860
t-shirt isn't the winning entry, and the
team doesn't make your shirt on their

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,140
shirt. But you go to the competition, and
another team from another school district

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,960
has your shirt design on the front of it.
How would you feel about that? How would

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,040
you feel if someone took your idea and
walked around with your shirt on? Your

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,072
idea, that you came up with your in your
own brain? How would that make you feel?

36
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:39,658
- Kind of angry.

37
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:41,400
- It would make me feel angry.
How about you?

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,000
- Sad.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,500
- Sad is another really good word for it.
I would be furious, if we used our

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,180
exciting words for our writing. But I
would also be really disappointed. Maybe

41
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,600
kind of flattered that someone liked my
idea so much they put it on their own

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,190
shirt, but it's the same thing. Is it
wrong to steal someone's bicycle?

43
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,794
- Yes.

44
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,570
- You think it's wrong. Why is it wrong to
steal someone's bicycle?

45
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,670
- Because that was just like stealing. You
steal without even asking.

46
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:14,730
- Right. And that would hurt someone's
feelings and it's illegal. Is it wrong to

47
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,510
steal someone's pencil?
Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Is

48
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,479
it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Why is
wrong to steal someone's pencil?

49
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,129
- Because it's their property.

50
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,650
- Because it's their property and it's not
yours. So stealing someone's ideas is the

51
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:31,440
same idea. So when you go to write your
stories, boys and girls, and the reason

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,580
we're writing our own stories is because
we're making this our own. We're making

53
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,300
this our own design. And I think that's
really important for us to remember,

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,920
because the more that you use your own
ideas, the better it is for you. You have

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,800
all these ideas in your heads, and I know
you all have wonderful creativity, so

56
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,600
we're writing our own stories. We're not
taking the story of a TV show you saw last

57
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,571
night like SpongeBob and you're not making
a SpongeBob story.

58
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:04,411
I want this to be your own idea.

59
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,530
So we have Aliens in the Library, and we
have our half here. You're a librarian,

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,550
you hear a strange noise, it sounds like 
screeching rats in a blender, what should

61
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:17,440
you do? We decided our two choices were
open the door or hide under your desk. If

62
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,190
you open the door, you see the cutest
little alien standing in the doorway. I

63
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,230
think we had a majority of people here, I
don't know if everyone here likes the

64
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,520
cutest little alien idea, but this is our
story and we're sticking with it. It has a

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,790
big pink bow in her hair, antennae, and a
pink polka dot dress. What do you do?

66
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,210
You could either invite her in or slam the
door in fright. You invite her in. She,

67
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,340
surprisingly, speaks your language. She
explains that her name is Lott and she

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,840
became stranded when her spacecraft
crashed. She asks if she can come home

69
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,560
with you. What do you do? You have two
choices here. You can either take her home

70
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,220
or find another place for her to stay.
Lott is a great house guest, she even

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,820
helps with the dishes. You're glad you
decided to take a chance on making a new

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,480
intergalactic friend. You guys have seen
this before. We made this story, and I'm

73
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,510
not going to go over this story again and
again, but I wanted to review with you

74
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,370
what we talked about because over here,
I'm going to show you what the final

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,121
product is going to look like.

76
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:27,450
This is what the story is going to be
made. We did PowerPoint together. You're

77
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,580
familiar with PowerPoint. We've done
dozens of PowerPoints by now, at least.

78
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:48,170
And so, on our screen here I'm going to
open up my document that I made while you

79
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,710
were gone, and it is what the PowerPoint
is going to look like when you're

80
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,120
finished. It is a choose your own
adventure PowerPoint. And this is showing

81
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,410
that you've mastered the skill of being
able to use PowerPoint. You need to show

82
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,560
me that you understand how to use this.
This is kind of like our, I would say our

83
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,500
final exam for PowerPoint so we know we
can move onto the next thing, or the next

84
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,350
project, the next exciting idea that we're
going to do.

85
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,310
So while this is loading, you're going to
see that there are hyperlinks, and we're

86
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,350
going to work on those as well, which will
take you to different parts of your

87
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,520
document. So up here we have Aliens in the
Library by Mrs. Albright. I chose pictures

88
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,760
that are graphics from PowerPoint, or from
Clipart. The reason I did that is because

89
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,980
we own those. I did not take them from the
internet and drag them here. What happens

90
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
if you take them from the internet and
drag them here? They're someone else's

91
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:52,100
ideas, remember? They're someone else's
pictures. Yes.[Inaudible]

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,150
- You have to put the date and you have
the put the website. We have to, what do

93
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,670
we call it? Cite those. But we're not even
going to do the citation because this is

94
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,980
more about the writing of the project. So
we're going to do that instead. My Aliens

95
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,610
in the Library. I'm going to show you the
start of this, and then you're going to go

96
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,630
start writing your own story. So here's my
Aliens in the Library story. Now, the best

97
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,280
one from this class, the one that we find,
or two, that we like the best, we're going

98
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,730
to put on my website so the younger
students can access these from home, which

99
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,680
I think is a really great idea.

100
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:29,870
These are not going to be graphic or
bloody. You can have some things happen,

101
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,180
but you can't have guts falling out and
eyeballs popping out of heads. Okay?

102
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,180
Because this is for a young... you have to
remember your audience. This is for first

103
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,390
and second graders to use in the library
when they come. So we are not going to

104
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,460
make a big, bloody, messy, gory story.
Okay? We're going to make cute little

105
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,790
alien stories, apparently. This is what we
made last time together...

106
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,100
All right. You are a librarian. You stay
late one night working on your computer

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,360
and you hear strange noises coming from
the hallway. It sounds like rats in a

108
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,480
blender. What should you do? We chose to
do open the door. So when I click on the

109
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:10,490
button that says open the door, it should
take me to that page. Ta-da. You open a

110
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,470
door and you see the cutest little alien
standing in the doorway. She has a big

111
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,460
pink bow in her hair and antennae, and a
purple polka dot dress. What do you do

112
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,090
next? We're going to invite her in.

113
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,000
If we invite her in, she actually speaks
your language. She explains that her name

114
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,180
is Lott and she became stranded on Earth
when her spaceship crashed. She asks if

115
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,790
she can come home with you. What do you
do? I want to see what you guys pick for

116
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:42,010
this one. Who wants to pick one? Who wants
to pick a direction? What are we going to

117
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,835
do, take her home or find her another
place to stay?

118
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:45,395
- Find her another place.

119
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:49,750
- Find her another place? Let's see what
we decided for that part of the story. You

120
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,220
hear her shuffle down the hallway. You may
have missed the chance of a lifetime to

121
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:00,630
meet an alien, but at least you are safe.
The end. Now notice my ends always go back

122
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,750
to the beginning. So this is PowerPoint,
that you're familiar with, used in a

123
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,070
different way. Are there any questions
about what we did here? Yes.

124
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,570
- How do you get the green buttons?

125
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,520
- That's what we're going to talk about,
and that's a new part of the skill that

126
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,720
we're working on, but right now, we're
going to just be making these. I'm handing

127
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,980
out these. You're going to be in your
groups and we're going to start writing

128
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,670
our stories. After you're checked and over
there, you'll make your

129
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,962
PowerPoints, and I'll help you with your
hyperlinks individually in your tables.

130
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:35,232
- Does it...
- I'm sorry, she's talking.

131
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:37,322
- Does it have to be Aliens
in the Library?

132
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:40,694
- No, no. No, no, no. That's a great
question. It can be anything you want.

133
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:44,766
Any kind of story that you're interested
in. As long as it is not ...

134
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:48,377
- Bloody or gory.
- Bloody or gory or ...

135
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:50,736
- Violent.

136
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,528
- Violent, or, what's the other thing that
we just talked about?

137
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,049
- Inappropriate.

138
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,760
- Inappropriate or guts, you guys are
really stuck on the guts.

139
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,513
- Copyright.

140
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:02,880
- Copyrighted by somebody else. I wanted
to show you a couple other ones that you

141
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,370
can choose when you come for book
exchange. One of them looks like this.

142
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,200
This is actually a non-fiction choose your
own adventure about George Washington

143
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,850
crossing the Delaware, and it's about you
changing history which I think is a really

144
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,480
neat idea. If you're not much of a reader,
but you still wanted to read some books,

145
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,590
this one is very similar to actually, what
we're making here in PowerPoint. It has

146
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,210
graphics, it's called a graphic novel, and
there are different pieces that look

147
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:41,100
almost like comic books. I have several of
these also. I have the newer versions of

148
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,700
the old ones that I showed you
and read out loud.

149
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,280
The ones from 1986, remember I told you
how I liked them when I was a kid, a few

150
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,860
years ago? This one just has new covers on
it, so if you're looking for those. And

151
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,110
then this last one, this is a brand new
series that I'm hoping to get more on,

152
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,490
it's called The Golden Path and it's the
same idea, just different characters and a

153
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,340
different set of authors that made those.
So if you're looking for a choose your own

154
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,750
adventure story, and you go to type it in
the library catalog, you can type in

155
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,773
choose your own adventure. The problem
with that is you need to

156
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:16,504
know how to spell adventure.

157
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:19,314
- A-D-V-E-N-T-U-R-E.

158
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:22,370
- That's exactly right. Thanks, I wasn't
even expecting that. The other thing to

159
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,400
remember when we're keeping in mind, I'm
going to be coming around to help you with

160
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,440
your PowerPoints. Remember, we have to use
that rubric, that rubric. Show me that you

161
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:40,140
know what I'm talking about. Which rubric
am I talking about? Show me. Show me your

162
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,670
papers. Yes. This is the one that you need
to do. Also, you can put that down. This

163
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,730
other one that I want you to remember, the
other thing to keep in mind, is we color

164
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:59,210
coded these and we numbered them. The
slides need to go in the order that you

165
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,530
need it to be. This is a review of
PowerPoint, so this shouldn't be anything

166
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,340
new that you haven't seen before.

167
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,230
This is kind of our graduation project for
PowerPoint so that we can move on to the

168
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,700
next project, next time. So we're working
with PowerPoint. Who remembers how to

169
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,090
insert a text box? What were the
directions? We went over this before, and

170
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,505
we went over it a couple different times.
How do we insert a text box?

171
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:31,511
- You go to insert, you go over under the
text box, click on it,

172
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:35,584
and then you'll drag it and there it is.

173
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:38,600
- There it is. And how do you make it
change color? Does anyone remember how we

174
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:53,620
make it change color? How do we make it
change color? We're on insert and text

175
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:05,770
box. And make sure you make one down here.
Yep. And then you can type in it, and then

176
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,770
you do what with it? That's not wanting to
cooperate is it? That's okay. Let's work

177
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,610
on this one together. If you click on text
box, you make the text box and you start

178
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,920
typing in it. Who remembers how we change
the color of the text box? That's what

179
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,520
we're going to need to be able to do for
our buttons and our hyperlinks that we

180
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,419
talked about. Who remembers?

181
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:36,230
- You double-click on the box and it will
show up...

182
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,420
- Right. You double click on the box, or
sometimes even triple click until you get

183
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,460
those three a's at the top, then you can
change your color. I'll be around to help

184
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,270
you. Are there any questions about this
right now? Anyone have anything that they

185
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,490
want to talk about before we get started.
Every slide has to have a picture. What

186
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,240
happens if you do not have a picture that
you like from Clipart? What do you do? I

187
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,850
want you, I'm encouraging you to use
Clipart because it's something that's

188
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,860
already there and we don't have to worry
about where the source came from. But what

189
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,052
do we do if you want to find a different
picture somewhere else? What do we do?

190
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,678
- Find your picture.

191
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:16,310
- You can find your picture under Google
images. Then what do we do?

192
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:23,280
- Then you copy it and then you put it
back, and then we copy the source.

193
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,450
- You have to have the source. Very good.
Very, very good. Okay. If you would like

194
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,963
to have a whole separate slide with
sources, you can do that.

195
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:33,818
And we've done that before.
- And the date.

196
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:37,530
- And the date is very important. I'm glad
that you remembered that. Okay, so I'll be

197
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,500
around to help you, go ahead and get
started back again on your project. Make

198
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,620
sure the slides are in order. Do you want
to format your designs? You go under

199
00:14:47,800 --> 00:15:06,830
design, you two can agree on a color
scheme. Do you like that one? That's good.

200
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,840
Let's look back at your thing. Let me see
which one was number two. That was number

201
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,250
three. Click on number two. And it should
be, exactly, boys, look at how you did

202
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:15,240
that. You put the words at the top, now I
did check the word vial on yours and it's

203
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,290
spelled wrong. V-I-A-L. Maybe my writing
is hard to read. And then you have the two

204
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,650
text boxes here at the bottom. If
something gets stuck, can I have you guys

205
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,400
be the experts and go over and help them?

206
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,749
- Sure.
- Okay, great. Thanks. Yes.

207
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:31,217
- Can you help us?
- Sure. What's the problem?

208
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:33,152
- We can get
[Inaudible]

209
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:37,170
- Well this one we want to get rid of.
Remember, when you go to do the insert and

210
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,970
you insert a new slide, you want to make
sure that the layout is the title only.

211
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,440
Remember how we talked about that one? So
you want to insert the text box. You show

212
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:57,300
me, what do we do? Right. And then what do
we do? Okay, so you drag it. What are you

213
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,590
typing in there? Okay. So you need how
many text boxes then? Exactly. All right,

214
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,819
so you go ahead and type in there so you
can show me you know what to do with that.

215
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,820
Can you click on it and then, use
typing? Upstairs.

216
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:37,037
Okay, now you want to, how do we make sure
you pull that up? There you go,

217
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,019
Are you okay
with all the pink?

218
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,754
- I don't care.

219
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:50,000
- Good. Make sure everyone's input is
added, though. Maybe he can help with the

220
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,220
graphics. Everyone needs to be able to do
something. We have to make sure this is

221
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,160
fair for everybody. You're working the
mouse, you're working the keyboard and

222
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,800
he's holding the paper. Let's maybe switch
it up a little bit closer, okay?

223
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,387
So everyone has a turn.
