1
00:00:00,582 --> 00:00:01,496
- Guys ready?

2
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:02,114
- [Students] Yes.

3
00:00:02,114 --> 00:00:04,874
- Okay number one, start, give your idea.

4
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:08,419
Read the word, give your
idea of the definition.

5
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,267
- Okay what's your word?

6
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:14,003
"Soldier," okay and

7
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,535
okay you're gonna give your idea?

8
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,739
What's your idea of soldier?

9
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:21,231
- I think tax is like when
you buy something like,

10
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,459
the extra, yeah.

11
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:23,450
- One person at
a time, it goes in order,

12
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,822
so what's your idea?

13
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:28,374
- Like a government, so

14
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:29,258
- Okay you need help.

15
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:31,022
Have you ever seen a soldier before?

16
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,159
- Taxes for me are...

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,831
- Where?

18
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:35,178
- Money or something, I don't know.

19
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:40,064
- And what does
a soldier do, do you know?

20
00:00:40,064 --> 00:00:42,098
Okay, he fights for freedom, very good.

21
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:43,234
So it's someone who fights for freedom,

22
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:44,301
that's your definition.

23
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,278
What's your definition?

24
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:49,506
(children discussing)

25
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:51,709
Very good, you guys keep
going, you're doing great.

26
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:54,868
Let me see how this
group is doing over here.

27
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:55,517
Where are you guys at?

28
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:57,364
Have you already given your definition?

29
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:57,862
- Yes.

30
00:00:57,862 --> 00:00:59,321
- Okay did you already give yours?

31
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,577
Did you already give yours?

32
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:02,389
Did you give yours yet?

33
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:03,013
What do you think it is?

34
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:04,771
What's the word?

35
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,605
- Patriot.

36
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:08,671
- Very good, patriot, and did
you listen to their ideas?

37
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,315
- Yeah.

38
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:14,066
- Okay and you need thinking time? Okay.

39
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:18,169
And remember, you can
build on their ideas too.

40
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:19,433
Louder, a little bit louder.

41
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:25,162
- I think it means to...

42
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:31,510
I think it's

43
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,316
- You've heard
it in a song, that word?

44
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:33,898
- Yeah.

45
00:01:33,898 --> 00:01:34,453
- Yeah?

46
00:01:34,453 --> 00:01:37,288
So someone was a patriot in a song?

47
00:01:37,288 --> 00:01:40,049
What did it mean, in the
song, if they were a patriot?

48
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,960
How did they feel?

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,364
- They feel sad?

50
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:49,940
- Sometimes sad, you can feel sad

51
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,964
if you're a patriot.

52
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:55,004
On 9/11, when the planes crashed through

53
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,352
the buildings, people were sad because

54
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:58,604
they were patriots, they
loved their country, right?

55
00:01:58,604 --> 00:01:59,927
And they were sad to see that.

56
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:02,571
Can you be happy if you're a patriot too?

57
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,407
- Yeah.

58
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:05,592
- When would you
be happy if you were a patriot?

59
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,935
You're a patriot for the
United States, right?

60
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:12,089
Or even for the country your
family originally came from.

61
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:16,247
How do you feel about that
country if you're a patriot?

62
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:16,944
- Happy.

63
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:20,359
- Happy, and do you not like
them or do you love them,

64
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,750
that country?

65
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,716
- I love them.

66
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:28,763
- You love them, okay, so a
patriot is someone that what?

67
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:32,014
- You could be more excited or happy?

68
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:34,034
- Okay and how do you feel in your heart

69
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:39,641
about the country?

70
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:42,117
Do you dislike it or do you like it a lot?

71
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,232
- I like it a lot.

72
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:44,656
- Okay, alright.

73
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:47,130
And I didn't hear your ideas
but can you guys get together

74
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,150
and agree, or do you
want to look it up first?

75
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,530
Should we look it up, to make
sure we have the right idea?

76
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,793
Okay everyone let's get into our books and

77
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,626
let me make sure you have your papers too.

78
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:58,974
There are your papers too,

79
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,482
goodness Miss Bryant got ahead of herself.

80
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:05,077
Just in case you forget the
direction, the page is 493

81
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:09,606
to check, go all the way to
your glossary page 493 to check.

82
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,742
(students discussing)

83
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:16,918
Let me see what you guys have, let's see.

84
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:19,843
Okay and where does that
money go to, do you guys know?

85
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,285
- The government.

86
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,428
- Oh, did you
look it up to make sure

87
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:25,768
that it was perfect, your definition?

88
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:28,112
Okay let's look it up real
quick and make sure because

89
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:30,200
it looks pretty good but
let's just make sure.

90
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,080
That's my fault because
I got busy with table one

91
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:40,656
and didn't give you this
paper so on page 493

92
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:43,228
there you go, 493 it starts
but then you have to go

93
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,319
in ABC order, right?

94
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,200
And let's look it up and make sure

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,065
you have the right definition.

96
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,819
You guys are looking up tax, that's right.

97
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:53,231
- A "T."

98
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,092
- "T, T, T," tax,
good, like the way you're

99
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,927
using your resource, 'cause
that was one of the things

100
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:59,435
we said we're gonna do,
is use our resource.

101
00:03:59,435 --> 00:04:07,491
(students discussing)

102
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,881
Okay, what did you get?

103
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:09,831
Do you know where to read it?

104
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:16,057
(child reading)

105
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,845
Good, I like the way that you
worked together and helped,

106
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:20,609
so, Les, what did you have?

107
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:23,585
- [Teacher and students]
Taxes for new money

108
00:04:23,585 --> 00:04:25,098
- To where, where does that money go?

109
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,040
- [Students] The government.

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,692
- Okay so let's add that.

111
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:27,644
Who started this?

112
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:28,480
- Her.
- Me.

113
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,293
- Okay so you wanna add that?

114
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:30,636
You guys all agree?

115
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:31,472
- [Students] Yeah.
- You feel good?

116
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,076
'Cause it's not just
any money for anybody,

117
00:04:33,076 --> 00:04:33,888
it's money to the?

118
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,048
- [Students] Government.

119
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,800
- Okay, so let's add that, go ahead.

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,388
Good, I like the way you used
your resource and checked it.

121
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:45,642
(students discussing)

122
00:04:45,642 --> 00:05:00,058
- A patriot is a person who

123
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:04,413
loves and supports

124
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,371
- their country.

125
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:07,555
- And that's kinda
what you guys said anyway

126
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,947
right, you said they love,
is that what you guys said

127
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:12,547
'cause I wasn't here earlier,
did you say stuff like that?

128
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:17,745
Oh great. Are all of you patriots?

129
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:20,763
Do you love your country?

130
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:24,831
- Loves and supports their country.

131
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:33,239
(shuffling papers)

132
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,582
- Okay, now what happens?

133
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:35,881
It goes to person

134
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:36,720
- Number two.

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,368
- Number two, you
get to read it and they're

136
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:40,202
gonna repeat the question, right?

137
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:41,946
Okay there you go and
here's the directions

138
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:43,758
just in case you forget.

139
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:47,310
- What is it like? Describe it.

140
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,262
- Okay, let's repeat.

141
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:52,534
- [Teacher and students]
What is it like? Describe it.

142
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,250
- You guys, did you repeat? Let's repeat.

143
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,850
- [Teacher and students]
What is it like? Describe it.

144
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,498
- Okay so before we
write, you get to start,

145
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:01,681
so what is it like?

146
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:04,386
Can you describe a patriot?

147
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:04,885
- [Boy] Yes.

148
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,880
- Okay what is it like?

149
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,229
- [Boy] It's like

150
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:10,897
- Or who is he like, 'cause
they're a person, right?

151
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:15,639
- [Boy] Is like someone who will

152
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,199
respect their country.

153
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,421
- Who's that? Can you think of
a person? Oh I'm sorry honey.

154
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,621
Can you think of a person?

155
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,237
Who's an example?

156
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:26,897
Let's see, describe it, so

157
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:28,733
when you think a patriot,

158
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:34,836
okay they support their
country, what else?

159
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:37,662
- [Boy] Respect the government.

160
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:39,528
- Very good, those are good
words, so you could put

161
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:41,133
that there, but we're not
gonna write yet, right?

162
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:41,989
Because we're gonna
give everyone a chance.

163
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,245
What would you say?

164
00:06:43,245 --> 00:06:45,265
What do you think of
when you think of patriot

165
00:06:45,265 --> 00:06:46,728
and you would describe it if you had to

166
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,324
describe it to someone.

167
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:53,552
- Patriot is

168
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:54,856
soldier.

169
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:56,702
- That's a great example.

170
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:58,756
What about you?

171
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:05,154
- Someone respect

172
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:08,564
every city everywhere and respect

173
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:12,013
to everybody to not be...

174
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:12,896
- Very nice.

175
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,833
- Can it be also honoring?

176
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,772
- I like that vocabulary
word, honor, how do you guys

177
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,535
feel about honoring?

178
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:20,999
What do you say about respecting?

179
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,555
Okay, alright, you get to write first.

180
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,759
You write one then it'll
go around and each of you

181
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,093
can write one in a box,
okay, every one of you write

182
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:28,823
something in the box.

183
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,692
If you need help, ask your
table for help, right?

184
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:36,139
Okay, good.

185
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,110
How's it goin'?

186
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:47,413
(students discussing)

187
00:07:47,413 --> 00:07:51,462
- If something costs $7.99,
it's plus, like, tax.

188
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:52,602
- Plus like, a dollar.

189
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,314
- Yeah, a dollar.

190
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:59,228
- Taxes come in
like, a dollar or two dollars.

191
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:04,027
- Just put
taxes like, extra money.

192
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:11,312
- Great, okay now you.

193
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:13,707
Alright so we said it
protects the country,

194
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:21,999
fights, what did you
say when you gave ideas?

195
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:27,107
- Fights for his,

196
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,786
risks his life for others.

197
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,683
- What do you guys think,
risks his life for others?

198
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:31,683
Should we include that?

199
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:32,620
- [Students] Yeah.

200
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,690
- Yeah? Okay, that's good.

201
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,641
Good, okay and then you're
gonna write one too, right?

202
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:54,179
(students discussing)

203
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,221
- [Teacher] What else
makes that "kuh" sound,

204
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,568
a "C" and what else?

205
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,467
- "K."

206
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,289
- You guys agree?

207
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,329
Okay let's put it down, a "K."

208
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:07,437
Risks.

209
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:11,665
I like the way you're helping
each other, that's great.

210
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:17,353
Alright.

211
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:18,500
Very nice.

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,210
Okay and you get to put an idea down too,

213
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,581
we wanna make sure everyone gets a chance.

214
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,323
So put your idea down, you
can put it in any of the boxes

215
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:28,916
because there's room, here, here, or here.

216
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,984
No that's fine because we're
all gonna keep going, yep,

217
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,632
so I want you to put your idea
that you said earlier here,

218
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:37,696
here, or here for describing the soldier.

219
00:09:37,696 --> 00:09:39,484
Do you remember what you said?

220
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:40,552
What'd you say?

221
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:43,175
(boy speaking)

222
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:44,660
Very good, so put that down.

223
00:09:44,660 --> 00:10:06,893
(students discussing)

224
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:11,527
- Tax is more
money for the government.

225
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:18,643
- You can just look in the book.

226
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:22,537
- Just put tax is

227
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:25,887
extra money for the government.

228
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,297
- We already have that.

229
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:35,886
- Oh I know, tax

230
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,666
is extra money for the government.

231
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:51,994
Tax is, I-S

232
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:56,944
for extra money for the government.

233
00:10:56,944 --> 00:11:11,672
(students spelling aloud)

234
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,525
- Okay so has
everyone given an example?

235
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:16,453
Okay so whose turn was
it to write, your turn?

236
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,998
So you write first and make sure everyone

237
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:22,922
gets to write one in.

238
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:28,293
- Tax is extra
money for government.

239
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:31,342
Money, money, money.

240
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:35,342
M-O-N-E-

241
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:38,325
- Yes, did you guys give
your examples first?

242
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:38,849
- Yeah.

243
00:11:38,849 --> 00:11:40,950
- Before you wrote? Okay good.

244
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,553
Do your parents pay taxes?

245
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:43,456
- [Students] Yes.

246
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:48,040
- They do. Everyone pays taxes,
that could be an example.

247
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,005
I have a question. Do
your parents pay taxes?

248
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,836
Everyone pays taxes, don't they?

249
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:56,252
Do we have to pay taxes
when we get gasoline?

250
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:56,783
- Yes.

251
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,201
- Yes, do we
have to pay taxes when

252
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,620
we buy a video game?

253
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,548
- Yeah.
- Everything.

254
00:12:00,548 --> 00:12:01,916
- Yes,
everything except for food.

255
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,432
Food they don't tax,
isn't that nice of them?

256
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,424
(laughter)

257
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,216
Okay and what does the tax go to support?

258
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:09,915
- The government?

259
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,273
- The government
and the schools, right?

260
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,551
And the firemen, the policemen,
good, okay so now you have

261
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:14,247
some more.

262
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:17,683
Great conversation, great conversation.

263
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:23,452
(students discussing)

264
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,987
- Was Thomas
Jefferson a patriot?

265
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:26,847
- Martin Luther King.

266
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,599
- Martin Luther King was a patriot, good.

267
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,243
Who else was a patriot?

268
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:32,311
- Abraham LIncoln?

269
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,635
- Yes, okay let's take turns
though, who's turn is it now?

270
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:38,746
Who's a patriot?

271
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:40,718
Someone who loves their country.

272
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:45,452
(students discussing)

273
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,078
Are you a patriot?

274
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:54,974
Could you say "I am a patriot?"

275
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:55,810
- I'm a patriot.

276
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,134
- Very good,
there's an example.

277
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:59,030
Can you think of someone who's a patriot?

278
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,012
- A soldier.

279
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,241
- A soldier. Why's a soldier a patriot?

280
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:06,030
Why do you think they love
their country so much?

281
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,860
What are they willing to risk?

282
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,702
- Their heart?

283
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:11,330
- Their heart and their what?

284
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,481
They could, what could
happen if they got shot?

285
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:15,162
- They die.

286
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,493
- Yeah, they're risking their
lives, so they really love

287
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:19,939
their country, they're
really patriots aren't they?

288
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:21,329
Very good, so you ready to write?

289
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:25,283
Who's turn is it?

290
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:27,515
No that's okay, so whoever's
next, so if it's your turn

291
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,967
you go.

292
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,457
Oh okay, so it's your turn so
you get to write an example

293
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:33,821
of a patriot.

294
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:35,608
Try to write in a complete
sentence, I bet you can.

295
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:42,582
(students discussing)

296
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:44,988
- You just draw pictures.

297
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:49,936
(students discussing)
