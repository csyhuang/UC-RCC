00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
- What are his tools?
- [Background Chatter]

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,370
- Is that your hose? Awesome. Now, what needs to
come out of the hose to put out the fire?
-Water.

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:38,896
- Yeah! What color is it? Miley is helping
you out. Look there. Good water. What do

4
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:44,458
you do with that thing, Marissa? What's
the doctor going to do with that? I can't

5
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:55,182
hear you. What? You're right. Listen to
your heart. Very good. Do you remember

6
00:00:55,182 --> 00:01:07,791
what we call that? Not a telescope, a
stethoscope. There you go. All right,

7
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,205
Miley, what does your teacher need? What
tools?

8
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:12,480
- A smart board.

9
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:22,560
- A smart board? Are you going to draw the
smart board? All right. Are you finished

10
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:34,306
with your fireman? Did you hear Miley? Do
you need to draw anything else for your

11
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:41,266
fireman or is he all good? I don't know
where the fire is. You're the artist,

12
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:57,670
where's his fire? It's your fire. Marissa,
what is that bag for?

13
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,060
- The doctor bag.

14
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,805
- The doctor bag, I love it. What did you
draw? What is that? Very good. And what do

15
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:13,983
you do with the stethoscope? Check your
heart. A whole bunch of fire? Well, I'm

16
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:24,616
glad you're the fireman and you're going
to put it out. I love it. There you go.

17
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:26,102
Good job.

18
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:38,102
That is one colorful nurse. I see it. 
It's great.

19
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:50,362
You're almost finished? What is that
orange thing? It goes your mouth and what

20
00:02:50,362 --> 00:03:04,178
does it do? Do you remember? It takes your
temperature. It's a thermometer. Good job.

21
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,977
What are you going to teach your kids
right there? Good job.

22
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,500
- What about the kids?

23
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:33,086
- She's on the smart board right now. Very
good.

24
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,750
All right just a few more minutes.
We have to finish up so you all can stickers

- You did draw the shot. You're done? All
right. You may go. Give me five. Great

29
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:31,430
job. I love your fireman.

[Background Chatter]

34
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:39,120
I love it! Good job, I love your teacher.
She's very happy. [Background Chatter] 
What are you going to do

35
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:57,830
in art? Make me a picture? Can't wait.
What is this? A stair bridge? Wow. Who's

36
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:17,567
going to use it?
I love it. Who has an airplane? What's the

37
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:26,599
person? I'm a teacher. I teach
kids. Who flies the airplane? Ask Aaron,

38
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:30,125
see if he can help you out. Do you
remember? Aaron, can you help him out? Who

39
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,865
flies the plane? What's his name?

40
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,630
- The pilot.

41
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:44,568
- Yeah. The pilot. Good job. Mary! What
are you? You're not the firefighter. What

42
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,585
are you? Who's uniform do you have on?

43
00:06:46,585 --> 00:06:48,025
- The cop.

44
00:06:48,025 --> 00:07:10,223
- The cop's. Very good. You're going to
arrest people? Why? They're speeding?

45
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:14,380
Watch out, Aaron, Mary's going to catch
some speeders.

46
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,100
- He's arrested.

47
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,220
- He's arrested? What was he doing?

48
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,053
- Speeding.

49
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:45,350
- Speeding? Oh no! Look what happens when
you speed. You crash. And who's going to

50
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,260
come rescue you? Who will come help you if
you crash? The policeman and who's going

51
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:01,250
to help you get better? Who did you see
yesterday? Who came to visit us yesterday?

52
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:13,312
Do you remember? We went out and got to
sit inside of it. Ambulance. Good job.

53
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:32,956
What's going on over here? You're what?
Tacos? How many? Two? Thank you. Are they

54
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:33,792
for me?

55
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,801
- This is my cake.

56
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:49,814
- Your cake? Okay. What are you going to
do with your cake after you mix it up? A

57
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:55,503
chocolate cake? Oh no.

58
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:03,281
- It just came out of the oven.

59
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:08,668
- It just came out of the oven? It looks
great. Is there a special occasion for

60
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:09,667
your cake?

61
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:15,600
- [Background Chatter]

62
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,167
- All right. That would be great. I'll
make sure nobody touches your cake. It's

63
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:39,644
fine. It'll stay right there. What are you
going to make? Cookie dough? What kind?

64
00:09:39,644 --> 00:10:00,240
You don't know? Put your hands up, she
said. You put it in the oven?

65
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:11,571
How long do you cook it? Five minutes or
five hours? Five minutes? Good job. Oh no,

66
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:19,300
it fell. I think... you're doing a good
job, but I think you have it crooked. Hang

67
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:49,745
on. That's an awesome cookie. Thank you.
Great job. What do you tell her? What do

68
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,301
you say?
- Thank you.

69
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,830
- Thank you.

70
00:10:56,641 --> 00:11:04,590
[Background Chatter]

71
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:24,323
You're working hard. You almost have it.
Cross it. Good job. Great job helping.

72
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,425
Awesome. I don't know where the lid is for
this. Did you ask Dylan if he's the one

73
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:38,325
that had it out? Dylan, do you know where
the lid is for the

74
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,184
[Background Chatter]?

75
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:55,751
Well then you need to help her. Show her
where it's at. She wasn't sure. Thank you.
[Background Chatter]

76
00:11:56,118 --> 00:12:14,851
Oh, hang on a second. N, O...
Is that an R?

77
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:15,988
- No.

78
00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:37,490
- No. Let's fix it. R, S. Help him out,
Dylan, what's after S? All right. There

79
00:12:37,670 --> 00:13:05,261
you go. What's next? There's your P, Q, R,
S... V. Then what?

80
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,100
What's going on over here? You're giving
him a shot? Why are you giving him a shot?

81
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:40,137
What happened to him? What happened to him
that he needs a shot? He's sick? Did it

82
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:45,524
hurt? What was in that shot? What was in
the shot?

83
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,848
- The needle.

84
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:51,557
- The needle, but what came out of it? It
was just in his hand. So, what did you

85
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:56,650
give him? Yeah, medicine. What are you
listening to?

86
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,175
- Your heart.

87
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:01,100
- My heart? Am I okay?

88
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,703
- Now I'm about to give you a haircut.

89
00:14:02,703 --> 00:14:15,220
- A haircut? All right. Julius, don't run.
All right. So, how do you like your job,

90
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:22,910
nurse? Good? I see why you made your
picture all different colors. Your nurse

91
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:30,570
uniform is all different colors. Good job!
I think your next appointment is here.

92
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:36,600
Have a seat, she can check you out. Leave
the chair right there. That's a shot, too.

93
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:53,424
There's a different shot. Yes, I'm scared.
Ow! Shots hurt. Ow! I think you only need

94
00:14:53,424 --> 00:14:55,680
one. What did you just give me?

95
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,250
- Medicine.

96
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,000
- Medicine? Is that my Band-Aid?
