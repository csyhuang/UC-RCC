1
00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:05,134
- [Teacher] Well, you know what,
especially after Mrs. Bennett

2
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:08,772
taught you the three things
she wanted you to do in reading

3
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:12,286
by having you look around the room,

4
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:14,134
and skip around the room,

5
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:16,735
and flip on the carpet,

6
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:19,173
we thought, "Oh boy, that Nathan really

7
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:21,652
"needs to do something hands-on."

8
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:24,191
And I know from you
being in Reading Recovery

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:28,743
that when you heard a book
twice you practically knew it.

10
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:30,389
I mean, you knew the story.

11
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:33,233
You could go somewhere and tell it, right?

12
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,244
- [Nathan] Yep.

13
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,577
- [Teacher] When you read the book

14
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:41,137
is it easy for you to retell it?

15
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:44,684
What is it like to retell
a story that you just read?

16
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:48,513
- [Nathan] Not so easy for me, 
'cause I had to

17
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:51,529
pick up a book,

18
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:52,912
look at it for a minute

19
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,703
and then I pop it and then I know it.

20
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:59,086
- [Teacher] Okay, if I read a 
story to you would you

21
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:02,174
be able to go tell it to someone else?

22
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:03,557
- [Nathan] Yes.
- [Teacher] Okay.

23
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:05,802
- [Nathan] But right next to me.

24
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:07,387
- [Teacher] Okay.
- [Nathan] Okay.

25
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:09,734
- [Teacher] All right, well these 
are the things we're gonna practice.

26
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:12,594
And because we don't want to leave out

27
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:15,498
the visual style of
learning because it's also

28
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:17,937
an important way to get information,

29
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:21,371
we're gonna focus on the
auditory and the kinestetic,

30
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,971
the hearing and the
hands-on type learning,

31
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:26,674
and we're also gonna include some visual

32
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:28,992
so that it will strengthen
that part for you.

33
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,991
But we wanna make sure we're getting you

34
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,921
where your strength is.

35
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,907
Because you are fantastic at listening

36
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,466
and doing hands-on activities.

37
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,806
Oh, you have a plan in your mind about

38
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:49,646
what kind of castle you're gonna build?

39
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:50,986
- [Nathan] It's not a castle. It's gonna be

40
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,404
like when I see that in movies.

41
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:58,408
Like a tower like where

42
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:00,830
the Egypt, Egyptites.

43
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,576
- [Teacher] The Egyptians?
- [Nathan] Yeah.

44
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:04,262
- [Teacher] Like a pyramid?
- [Nathan] Yeah.

45
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,050
- [Teacher] Okay, cool.

46
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,482
All right.

47
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:12,169
Would you like some extra things,

48
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,415
like maybe some games or
some extra things you can do

49
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:18,996
to help you remember in class?

50
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:22,754
- [Nathan] Yeah because my teacher
she gives us free games,

51
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,873
like learning games, in our math book.

52
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:28,077
There's math games

53
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,959
and you have to put your thing on it

54
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,073
and you have to guess who much it is.

55
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:34,328
And if you get it right you stay on there.

56
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,505
- [Teacher] Okay, cool.

57
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:37,782
Well I want to add some games like that

58
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,468
that you're gonna--

59
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:42,250
And we're gonna add some
things that you can do

60
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,391
to help you remember directions in class

61
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:49,272
and remember what Miss
Smithson has asked you to do.

62
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:53,071
'Cause one of the things
that I've noticed is that

63
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,870
when Miss Smithson gives
you two or three directions,

64
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,458
you'll start one and then you
forget what the other ones are.

65
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:03,071
And you're like, "Ugh, what do I do now?"

66
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,608
- [Nathan] Yeah because my 
brain it has so much stuff

67
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:11,187
and because if I get more

68
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:13,573
it kind of breaks the other stuff.

69
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,894
- [Teacher] And you know, I wasn't
gonna talk about this yet

70
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:21,044
but by you saying that, your
brain has so much stuff,

71
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,603
I wanted to remind you about,

72
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,920
do you know what good
listening looks like?

73
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,541
- [Nathan] Uh, huh.

74
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,588
- [Teacher] What do good listeners look like?

75
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:31,207
- [Nathan] Their hands are crisscrossed

76
00:03:31,207 --> 00:03:32,783
with their hands in their lap

77
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,903
and wherever the teacher goes

78
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,650
they keep their eyes on 'em.

79
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,734
- [Teacher] Okay, and then if you
have a comment, if I say,

80
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,903
"Would anyone like to ask a question

81
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:48,560
"or make a comment about
what we're learning?"

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,379
Let's say I just taught
you about Clemson Football.

83
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:56,775
- [Nathan] Or I like hockey.

84
00:03:56,775 --> 00:03:57,627
That's my favorite.

85
00:03:57,627 --> 00:04:00,747
- [Teacher] Okay, let's say we were
learning about hockey.

86
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:05,440
The equipment used in hockey, okay?

87
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,916
So if I asked you to
either ask me a question

88
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:13,445
or make a comment about
what we're learning,

89
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:17,789
would you

90
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,867
tell me the names

91
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,934
of some of the hockey
equipment that you know of?

92
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:27,283
Or would you ask me a question about

93
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:29,244
a piece of hockey
equipment that you've seen

94
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,662
but you don't know what it's called?

95
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,835
Or would you tell me a story about

96
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:37,318
how you really like hockey?

97
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,493
- [Nathan] Hmmm, how I really like hockey.

98
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,484
- [Teacher] I knew you'd say that!

99
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:43,426
You always do that!

100
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,990
You remember one of things that

101
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,966
Miss McGinnis taught
you in Reading Recovery?

102
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:52,244
And one of the strengths,

103
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:55,574
this is what I love about you,

104
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:57,078
one of the things that a lot of people

105
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,763
have trouble with when they're reading

106
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:02,075
is that they can't relate
what they're reading

107
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:04,295
to themselves or to their lives.

108
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,788
You are absolutely fantastic with that.

109
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:08,897
Fantastic.

110
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:12,350
- [Nathan] If there's a story of
a dog and I have a dog

111
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,500
and my dog did the same thing.

112
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,658
- [Teacher] Right.

113
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:20,194
So since you're so good at that, though,

114
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:24,460
sometimes I think that that
is one of the things that

115
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,883
gets your mind off on... on...

116
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,510
"Hey my dog did that."

117
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,308
Instead of on exactly what your
teacher's wanting you to do.

118
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:36,540
So one of the things about
being a really good listener

119
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,684
is to remember what
comments, and what statements

120
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:45,316
and what questions are necessary
for what you're learning.

121
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:48,375
And which comments and
questions should wait for later,

122
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,092
even though they're zinging
around in your head, okay?

123
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:56,124
So if I'm doing a whole class lesson about

124
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,022
different colored fur on dogs

125
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:05,821
and I say, "Can anyone think of a color

126
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,752
"that a dog's fur might be?"

127
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:11,023
What would be a comment you could make?

128
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:13,176
- [Nathan] Black and brown 'cause

129
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:16,893
that's what my dog is made out of.

130
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:18,560
- [Teacher] Okay, black and brown.

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,477
All right, let's say somebody says blonde,

132
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:23,266
somebody else says white

133
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,074
and then somebody raises
their hand and they say,

134
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,415
"Well, I don't know what
all colors dogs can be

135
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:32,935
"but my dog Sandy is really pretty."

136
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,539
Is that a comment that is necessary

137
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,529
for what we're talking about?
- [Nathan] No.

138
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:42,450
- [Teacher] Okay, so that's one of the
things that you can practice.

139
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,946
And I love your stories and I
know Miss Smithson does, too.

140
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:50,157
And you have a lot of kids
and grownups in this school

141
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:52,522
that feel really close
to you and we feel like

142
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,250
we have a good relationship with you

143
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,587
because you do share
things about yourself.

144
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:59,491
- [Nathan] Yeah, but I only do that
at the beginning of the day,

145
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,373
the end of the day and at writing.

146
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:04,564
'Cause I write down the things in writing.

147
00:07:04,564 --> 00:07:07,163
- [Teacher] Good, well then I'm
glad Miss Smithson is also

148
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:09,379
working on this with
you because as much as I

149
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,283
want to know about you I
don't want it to distract

150
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:15,831
you from what it is you're
supposed to be thinking about.

151
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,817
Okay?
- [Nathan] Okay.

152
00:07:17,817 --> 00:07:19,584
- [Teacher] Three more blocks.

153
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,868
Okay, let's talk about some of the things

154
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:37,160
that we're gonna put
in place for you, okay?

155
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,661
A couple of 'em I'm pretty
excited about, okay?

156
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:48,224
We're gonna work on your memory

157
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:52,429
with reading and in general with classwork

158
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,005
so that when someone
tells Nathan what to do,

159
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:58,078
Nathan's gonna be able to remember it.

160
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,572
Instead of getting distracted
and thinking, "Huh.

161
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:03,592
"I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do next."

162
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:07,497
- [Nathan] Yeah because in my
class there's some kids,

163
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:11,508
Zachary and Brody and the two new kids,

164
00:08:11,508 --> 00:08:13,955
they're talking in the back.

165
00:08:13,955 --> 00:08:16,511
- [Teacher] And that's can be very
distracting, can't it?

166
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,173
Okay, do you know how to focus?

167
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:21,245
Do you know how to tune people out?

168
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:24,148
What do you do when you're
distracted in the classroom?

169
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:27,724
- [Nathan] I just turn around and go like this.

170
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:30,434
- [Teacher] Okay, do you think you
know how to tune people out

171
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:33,644
without having to tell them to stop?

172
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:35,900
What if you knew they were
gonna talk no matter what

173
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,667
but you still needed to listen?

174
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,876
Could you?

175
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:42,866
- [Nathan] I could do this to block their sound.

176
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,857
- [Teacher] Okay, you could.

177
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,207
That kinda reminds me of the bat

178
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:48,442
we were talking about for some reason.

179
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:52,635
It's kinda like you're directing
your hearing at one place.

180
00:08:52,635 --> 00:08:56,496
- [Nathan] And sometimes I push it
to what I'm hearing at.

181
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,413
So then when I do that in my mouth

182
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,400
I can hear it more good without

183
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,669
noises from the construction
site that's near our house.

184
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:11,756
I can focus on it.

185
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:15,108
- [Teacher] Okay, I think that's
fantastic what you've just said.

186
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,688
You make a conscious effort to focus

187
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,882
on what you're trying to hear.

188
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:23,702
That what I want you to do when you notice

189
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,425
that other people are talking behind you.

190
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:29,403
Instead of worrying
about what they're doing,

191
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,613
I want you to focus on what
you need to be hearing.

192
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,279
I want you to stop and think,

193
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,538
"I'm not gonna listen to them,

194
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:37,895
"I'm gonna listen to Miss Smithson."

195
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:38,394
Okay?

196
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,782
And see if that helps.

197
00:09:40,782 --> 00:09:45,397
Just like you strain to hear
the construction noises, okay?

198
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:48,246
All right, we're gonna do
some fun things with you

199
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,624
that I think you're gonna like.

200
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:56,504
First of all, I know you love video games.

201
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:59,674
So one of the things
that we've tried before

202
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:04,391
that doesn't seem to be
working very well is Odyssey.

203
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:06,668
And I know that when you get on Odyssey

204
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:11,109
you like to choose the math
games over the reading games.

205
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,507
Probably just--Why do you
choose math over reading?

206
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:17,124
- [Nathan] 'Cause I wanna get 
more math so then I can just

207
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:19,694
focus on reading 'cause if
I'm really smart at math

208
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:22,640
I can just drop it so I know everything.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,717
- [Teacher] I know sweetheart.

210
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:25,589
It's a lot more fun to do something

211
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:27,227
that you're really good at.

212
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,620
So we're gonna change up
your computer program.

213
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,464
Instead of having you work
on Odyssey during the day,

214
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,675
instead of Odyssey you're gonna

215
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,884
work on a new program called Earobics.

216
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,441
And it's supposed to be super

217
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:41,798
helpful with your reading skills.

218
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:44,316
And Mrs. Price, the speech teacher

219
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:46,999
whose office is across the hall,

220
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:50,250
she said it is really fun
and that she knew kids

221
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,069
at Griggs Road that did it
and they loved it, okay?

222
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:55,511
So we're gonna try Earobics.

223
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:58,925
So we're gonna keep a
computer game for you

224
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:02,828
but we're gonna try one that
hopefully is gonna work better

225
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,525
to help your reading skills
come up instead of Odyssey.

226
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,090
Okay? All right.

227
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,398
The next thing we're gonna do is

228
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:15,742
we're gonna give you a
little tape recorder.

229
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,591
Have you ever had a tape recorder?

230
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:20,617
- [Nathan] No and I haven't even seen one.

231
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:23,108
- [Teacher] I know, a lot of people don't
use tape recorders anymore.

232
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:25,079
Most people can record
things on their phone

233
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,695
and all kinds of gadgets.

234
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:30,183
- [Nathan] Well I had when I 
was little I had this

235
00:11:30,183 --> 00:11:32,815
little thing and it had a recorder.

236
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:34,871
When I would sing a
song into the microphone

237
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,829
I could record it and then
play it to my friends.

238
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:40,714
- [Teacher] Okay, well we're gonna
do something like that.

239
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:45,082
We're gonna have you, if Mrs.
Smithson is giving directions

240
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:48,596
and then you guys are getting
ready to do an assignment

241
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:52,985
or group work or whatever
it is she wants you to do,

242
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,444
she's gonna come over and she's gonna

243
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:58,978
give the directions to you.

244
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:02,960
You get to press record
on your tape recorder

245
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,782
and say the directions yourself
into the tape recorder.

246
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:10,786
Then you get to stop it and play it back

247
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:13,655
and hear yourself saying the directions.

248
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:14,951
Okay?

249
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,870
Unless you need them, we're
gonna have you put the little

250
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,998
tape recorder away so that
it doesn't bother you.

251
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:24,082
Like maybe in a pocket behind
your seat or something.

252
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:27,168
And then only if you
get stuck and you think,

253
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:30,897
"Hmm, what did Miss
Smithson want me to do?"

254
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,844
can you get out that recorder and listen.

255
00:12:33,844 --> 00:12:36,640
- [Nathan] Yeah or I can have it

256
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,698
recording beside me so I
could record everything

257
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,913
and if I still remember it,

258
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:44,372
like it's so easy I can remember it,

259
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:47,317
I can just erase it.

260
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:48,191
- [Teacher] Okay.

261
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:51,206
But I think the actual act of

262
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:53,583
hearing it whole group

263
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,797
with the rest of the kids in your room,

264
00:12:55,797 --> 00:12:58,622
hearing it with just Miss
Smithson telling it you,

265
00:12:58,622 --> 00:13:02,929
saying it again yourself and
then hearing what you said,

266
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,351
that may be all you need.

267
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,724
You may not have to listen to it again.

268
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:10,588
I think just making sure you're
really concentrating on what

269
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:14,650
the directions are is gonna
be a really good thing for ya.

270
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:25,694
Okay, also, oop.

271
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,132
I gotta get something from over here.

272
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:38,439
Okay.

273
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,741
One of the other things we might do is

274
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:45,971
maybe Miss Smithson
might tell you something,

275
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,514
like give you a direction,

276
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:50,074
and she's gonna whisper it in your ear

277
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:53,895
and then you have to whisper
it to the person beside you.

278
00:13:53,895 --> 00:13:56,495
And they're gonna whisper
it to the person beside them

279
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,527
and it's gonna go around the table

280
00:13:58,527 --> 00:13:59,725
until it gets back to you.

281
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:03,119
How many of you all sit at one group?

282
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:05,051
- [Nathan] Five or six.

283
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:08,342
I think it's gonna be five
'cause we got two more kids.

284
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,122
- [Teacher] Okay, so sometimes
Miss Smithson might say,

285
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:15,921
"Get out your pencil,
get out your math book

286
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,130
"and turn to page 50."

287
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,882
Okay?

288
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:21,702
So then you have to whisper that

289
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:23,735
into the ear of the person beside you.

290
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,916
What would you say?

291
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,697
- [Nathan] "Get out your pencil
and get out your math book

292
00:14:28,697 --> 00:14:30,729
"and turn to page 50."

293
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,834
- Okay and then that person would

294
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,398
have to whisper it to them.

295
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,227
Then it's gonna come all the way around

296
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:39,265
and then the last person's gonna say,

297
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:43,204
"Get out your pencil,
get out your math book

298
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:46,475
"and turn to page 60."

299
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:47,900
Is that right?

300
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,326
- [Nathan] I'll just turn back to
'em and say, "It's 50."

301
00:14:51,326 --> 00:14:53,409
- [Teacher] It's 50. Okay, okay.

302
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:55,461
That's another way we
might make sure that we

303
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,126
understand the directions
before we get started.

304
00:14:58,126 --> 00:15:00,786
- [Nathan] Sometimes my teacher
she just writes it on--
