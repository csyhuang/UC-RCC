1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:05,172
- Well, let's say about like a plane.

2
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:08,585
A plane can use the wing to, like,

3
00:00:08,585 --> 00:00:10,597
slice right through the, the wind,

4
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:13,198
making it just fly with ease,

5
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:15,157
but let's say the wing was vertical,

6
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:17,238
and then it would just be
working like a parachute

7
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,958
and just stop its fall.

8
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:21,831
- Okay, did everybody
hear what he said?

9
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,642
- No.

10
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:23,599
- Daniel, did you understand

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:24,632
what Jonathan was saying?

12
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:25,391
- Yeah.

13
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:27,235
- Okay, so does that make
sense to you then,

14
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,240
Daniel?

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,525
- Yeah.

16
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,276
- Okay, John?

17
00:00:31,276 --> 00:00:32,600
- About the thing, the last part,

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,296
did he say vertical?

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,876
- Yeah, like, like, like,

20
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:41,402
vertical, like pointing upwards.

21
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:43,485
- Oh. Okay.

22
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,521
- What do you think?

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,440
Reese, what do you think?

24
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:53,556
- Um, what Jonathan said?

25
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,406
- Jonathan, would you kind
of say it again?

26
00:00:57,406 --> 00:00:58,990
Reese would really like
to pay attention

27
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,714
and he'd like to hear.

28
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:02,726
- Yeah, I'm saying, like,

29
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:04,933
like a wing,

30
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:09,347
it uses, like, like,
like a V shape of a duck,

31
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,436
of a duck squad.

32
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:13,812
Like every single wing

33
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:16,286
goes down each part

34
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:18,817
and then it's just like a V.

35
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:20,325
- Okay.

36
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:21,558
- Shayla?

37
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:25,628
- Um, I said they fly because
the air pressure in the wings

38
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,804
gives it stability to keep stable

39
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:32,008
and make sure it doesn't
fall onto the ground.

40
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:33,172
- Okay.

41
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,674
Kelsey?

42
00:01:34,674 --> 00:01:39,031
- Um, I think that if the
aerospace vehicle was in space

43
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,906
then I think it would
just float in space

44
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:43,734
because there's no gravity.

45
00:01:44,032 --> 00:01:45,781
- Okay, we're kind of...

46
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:46,984
yeah, Ramaji?

47
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:49,068
- Okay, I'm kind of lost...

48
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,934
- Ramaji is lost, let's
help her find herself.

49
00:01:52,234 --> 00:01:53,638
No, that's a good thing.

50
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:54,561
Because, I'll be honest,

51
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,525
I'm a little lost.

52
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,360
So tell me where you are.

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,561
- Like, I thought we were
supposed to put, like,

54
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:02,922
why we think they were built,

55
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,803
not how they were built,

56
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:08,163
like, like, I wrote, um,

57
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:10,265
I think aerospace vehicles

58
00:02:10,265 --> 00:02:12,438
fly to improve society and help,

59
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,273
and new aerospace technology helps

60
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:15,960
build modern things.

61
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,347
- Okay.

62
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,064
Can everybody understand where Ramaji

63
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:20,698
went with her answers?

64
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:21,689
Kelsey?

65
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:23,689
- I'm totally lost now.

66
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,591
- Okay, here's what happened, okay,

67
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:30,715
so let me see if we can find
this a different direction.

68
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:34,072
Um, in reading all your
different sentences,

69
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:37,033
most of us had a purpose

70
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,723
for aerospace vehicles flying, okay,

71
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:43,002
or some of you wrote

72
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:47,402
that they fly both in
space and in the air, okay,

73
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:50,351
and so we're not kind of getting

74
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:51,879
where I want to get to.

75
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,883
So can I, for a second,

76
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,993
kind of change the discussion?

77
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:57,702
Just because... Yes, John?

78
00:02:57,702 --> 00:03:01,188
- Is it, like, when you
take a rocket, like,

79
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:04,513
on the rocket it has, uh...

80
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:07,318
two wings and like one tail?

81
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:08,637
- Great, so,

82
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:10,478
his question that he asked,

83
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:12,917
does a rocket have
two wings and a tail?

84
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:15,235
Um, here's what's happening.

85
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:18,245
Mm, I thought the vehicles would help you,

86
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,760
and what I'm seeing is,

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,270
having the vehicles is
making you try to figure out

88
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,481
what it is about how
this vehicle was made.

89
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:27,920
And I'm not as concerned about

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,444
how this vehicle is made, okay,

91
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:34,844
as I am the science behind

92
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:39,281
how it flies and why
we design it that way,

93
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,558
does that make sense?

94
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:41,480
- Yes.

95
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,873
- Okay, so can we go a different way

96
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,073
with me for a minute?

97
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,081
Each of you has a picture
of a hot air balloon

98
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:47,771
on your table, correct?

99
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:49,473
Okay.

100
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,439
I know, I took yours, Reese,

101
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,235
which is why you don't have one now.

102
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,137
I need to know something, okay?

103
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,372
This vehicle doesn't have an engine, okay?

104
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:05,285
Okay?

105
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:08,604
Now, I want you to think
about this for a minute,

106
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:11,592
and I want you to discuss
it at your table

107
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:13,601
before we talk whole group.

108
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,935
I want to know how does
this hot air balloon fly,

109
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,219
how does it get in the air,

110
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,914
and how does it stay in the air?

111
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:28,533
And is it possible you don't
know anything about this?

112
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:31,730
- Possibly?

113
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,759
- Possibly.

114
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,399
It is possible, okay,

115
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,202
it is possible, Joelle,

116
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:39,561
you don't know anything about this, okay.

117
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,713
So I want your table group to share

118
00:04:41,713 --> 00:04:45,164
what you know for a couple of minutes

119
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:47,779
about a hot air balloon
and how it flies, okay?

120
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,402
And I'm gonna come around and talk

121
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,202
to different groups, okay?

122
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:53,367
So how does this
hot air balloon fly?

123
00:04:54,198 --> 00:05:00,033
[Background Chatter]

124
00:05:01,524 --> 00:05:04,930
Okay, so you two start the
discussion at this table.

125
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:09,201
[Background Chatter]

126
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,279
So, discuss that,

127
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,645
because some of us did
have a good concept

128
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:27,560
and some of us don't, okay?

129
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,143
So share in your group.

130
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,169
Okay, what do you two know?

131
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,615
[Background Chatter]

132
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:40,845
Okay.

133
00:05:41,512 --> 00:05:44,054
Has an engine, a propulsion engine?

134
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:49,453
[Background Chatter]

135
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,474
Okay, but is that an engine?

136
00:05:52,739 --> 00:06:04,992
[Background Chatter]

137
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,477
Okay, so now you can
do your discussion.

138
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:09,632
What did you come up with over here?

139
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:13,607
[Background Chatter]

140
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:18,442
So the fire blows hot
air into the balloon.

141
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:21,035
[Background Chatter]

142
00:06:21,793 --> 00:06:24,212
Okay, without it, it would do what?

143
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,575
It would fall down, okay.

144
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:28,573
Okay?

145
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:34,201
So, any idea why the hot
air makes the balloon rise?

146
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:35,814
What do you think?

147
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:41,723
[Background Chatter]

148
00:06:42,162 --> 00:06:43,455
Okay, okay.

149
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:46,843
[clapping]

150
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,347
Ooh, that was awesome.

151
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:50,803
You are so good today.

152
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:53,559
Um, I think

153
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,525
we're now getting somewhere.

154
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:58,926
So let's talk about this hot
air balloon for a minute, okay.

155
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:03,190
So, I've heard some different
things around the classroom,

156
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,789
I want to know how does that balloon

157
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,131
get into the air?

158
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:12,517
Nathan?

159
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,482
- The fire in the hot air balloon

160
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:17,683
blows the, the balloon up

161
00:07:17,683 --> 00:07:19,956
to where it can float down.

162
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:23,551
- Okay, Shayla, do you agree or disagree?

163
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:26,039
- I agree with that, because, yeah,

164
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,994
because you pull on a cord

165
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:32,919
and like, it lights up the fire and stuff,

166
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,567
and then the fire pulls in air

167
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:38,532
and it, like, shoots it up with the fire.

168
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,800
- So, is the fire being shot

169
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,363
into the hot air balloon?

170
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,526
- No, air is.

171
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:44,980
- What kind of air?

172
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,757
- Hot air.

173
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,084
- Hot air is being shot up

174
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,750
into this part.

175
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,631
Okay. John?

176
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,153
- Didn't they say one of
those, like if you compare...

177
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:55,635
- They can't, Jonathan can't hear you.

178
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:56,314
- Oh, sorry.

179
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,058
If you compare a hot air
balloon and a balloon,

180
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:02,991
they're, you use hot
air for the air balloon,

181
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:06,164
and you use the helium
for a small balloon,

182
00:08:06,164 --> 00:08:07,964
yeah, and the,

183
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:09,939
it's not really air, kind of,

184
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,275
I thought it was steam.

185
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:13,600
- Okay, okay.

186
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,072
Now why would you think it was steam?

187
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:18,553
- Because you know how when you just, um,

188
00:08:18,553 --> 00:08:22,424
when you put like a fire,

189
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:25,746
fire in one place,

190
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,006
it sometimes can turn into steam? Maybe?

191
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,597
- The fire turns into steam?

192
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:30,554
- No, not the fire,

193
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,156
but like when it's, when it's done...

194
00:08:33,156 --> 00:08:34,326
- Ann Maria says she thinks

195
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:36,081
you need the word "water."

196
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:39,154
- Yeah, because when you heat up water,

197
00:08:39,154 --> 00:08:42,822
then steam comes up out of it.

198
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,165
Because steam is, like, moisture.

199
00:08:45,165 --> 00:08:47,323
- Steam is like moisture that's...

200
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:47,996
- In the air.

201
00:08:47,996 --> 00:08:49,066
- In the air, okay.

202
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:49,865
Ramaji?

203
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:51,757
- I agree with you, John.

204
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:54,363
[laughter]

205
00:08:54,363 --> 00:08:56,837
Okay, I think what he's saying is,

206
00:08:56,837 --> 00:09:00,085
because in air and the
fire is there or whatever,

207
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,274
and so then when they're
getting pushed up

208
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:05,050
that comes and like, then...

209
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:07,717
I'm lost here!

210
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:10,154
Okay, like then the steam,

211
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,603
like,

212
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:13,717
yeah, you were right
about the moisture part,

213
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:16,874
but it, but there is no way

214
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:20,885
that, like, water is in this...

215
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:22,987
- There isn't water in there!

216
00:09:22,987 --> 00:09:23,958
- Yeah, I mean...

217
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:24,872
- Reese, be supportive.

218
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:27,472
[laughter]

219
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:30,284
- I mean, there's moisture in the air,

220
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:32,959
but still, like...

221
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,194
fire is a big part of it!

222
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:37,232
- Okay, can I ask a question?

223
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,284
Okay?

224
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,436
Do I need water

225
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:42,951
in order for the hot air balloon to fly?

226
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:45,194
- No, no you don't!

227
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:47,396
- Ramaji says no,

228
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:48,716
Laura says no?

229
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,078
- I said no.

230
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:53,437
- Mariah says no.

231
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:54,642
Kelsey?

232
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,003
- I'm totally lost!

233
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:58,406
[Background Chatter]

234
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:01,124
- Kelsey, it's okay to be lost, okay.

235
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:02,791
Kelsey,

236
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,120
you're, if you're lost,

237
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,001
you need to know where you are.

238
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,796
So here's the question,

239
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:11,917
what do you feel like
you know and understand

240
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,926
about what's been discussed so far?

241
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,442
- I thought I was
understanding everything

242
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,506
until John said...

243
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:19,403
I'm so confused right now!

244
00:10:19,403 --> 00:10:20,652
- So tell me...

245
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:22,842
- John was talking about steam.

246
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:24,803
- John was talking about steam.

247
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:26,006
I would agree, Kevin,

248
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:27,401
John was talking about steam.

249
00:10:27,401 --> 00:10:28,800
So the question is,

250
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,922
prior to that, Kelsey,

251
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,557
okay, prior to that,

252
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:34,999
what would be your understanding

253
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,475
of how the hot air balloon flies?

254
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:40,282
- Basically,

255
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:42,795
nothing before that,

256
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:45,950
I just think it's steam,

257
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,940
because of like hot and air,

258
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,647
because, or like,

259
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:52,877
there would be like a
fire inside of the air

260
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:55,661
and then it would be steamy...

261
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:59,392
- Okay, let's see if I can
bring around some concepts.

262
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,361
Ramaji and John, can you let
me have two seconds, okay?

263
00:11:03,993 --> 00:11:08,355
Um, we have a concept of
this fire that's heating air,

264
00:11:09,362 --> 00:11:12,400
but we also seem to
have a concept of water

265
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,047
that gets heated and creates steam.

266
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,309
Correct?

267
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,193
But I'm also hearing,

268
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,427
and I just want to make
sure I understand,

269
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:24,196
I'm hearing that the steam
isn't necessary

270
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:25,566
for the balloon to go up.

271
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:27,165
John?

272
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,544
- Well this is, this is
how I thought it was steam.

273
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:31,915
Because you know how
sometimes there's clouds,

274
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:34,630
and you, you want to go
up in the air balloon,

275
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,305
and sometimes it might rain,

276
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,085
like when you're in the air balloon

277
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,591
sometimes it, like,

278
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,036
when you pass through a cloud

279
00:11:41,036 --> 00:11:42,871
and the air is super hot,

280
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,112
it actually turns into steam I think.

281
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:46,844
- Okay.

282
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:48,032
Ramaji?

283
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:48,918
- Okay.

284
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,600
- Listen, I've got to come over here.

285
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
- Okay, so like, like...

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,560
- You two can put your
hand down for a minute

287
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,281
and I'll go to you next.

288
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,226
- So like, steam is,

289
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,920
I think it's putting pressure,

290
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,141
like on the balloon to like,

291
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,680
make it go up?

292
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,649
- So we feel like we
have air pressure, okay.

293
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,077
- I don't agree with Ramaji though

294
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,589
because with the air
there's no steam involved,

295
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:15,960
there's like, kinda like what John said,

296
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,004
he said when the planes come
up the hot air pushes it...

297
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,227
- Okay, I'm gonna ask...

298
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:27,117
Oops, I didn't let you speak.

299
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:29,040
- Well, like, it's just like,

300
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,843
like comparing this to
a regular balloon,

301
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:34,111
with helium it would float up

302
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,805
just like an air balloon,

303
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,039
but you can't put helium
in an air balloon.

304
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,511
- Does everybody understand that?

305
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,759
So if I put...

306
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,792
okay, that is an awesome analogy!

307
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,083
So everybody listen.

308
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,485
If I put helium, helium is a...

309
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,310
- A gas!

310
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,199
- A gas, okay, helium is a gas,

311
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,319
so if I take a regular rubber balloon

312
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,003
and I put helium in it,

313
00:12:54,003 --> 00:12:55,786
the helium because it's a gas,

314
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:56,989
helium floats,

315
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:59,161
that makes my balloon float, right?

316
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:02,290
Whereas if I just blow up
a balloon, what happens?

317
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:06,229
It just falls down on the
ground and I got nothing, okay.

318
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,043
On the flip side, Kevin,

319
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,601
what she's saying is,

320
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,801
with a hot air balloon,

321
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:13,280
instead of filling it with helium,

322
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,342
I'm filling it with hot air, okay?

323
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:16,956
Now I have a question,

324
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:20,241
I think you've got to think
really deep about this one.

325
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:22,988
If hot air, Reese,

326
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:27,524
is what makes my hot
air balloon go up, okay,

327
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,885
I want to know,

328
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:33,041
would it be easier for me

329
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,559
to fly my hot air balloon

330
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,091
on a warm day or on a cold day?

331
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:42,642
Just think about it for a second,

332
00:13:42,642 --> 00:13:43,929
just think.

333
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,564
Would it be easier for
my hot air balloon,

334
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:48,785
do you think,

335
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,807
to fly on a hot day or a cold day?

336
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,238
- What about on a windy day?

337
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:57,564
- Ooh!

338
00:13:57,564 --> 00:14:00,559
Okay, she said what about
on a windy day.

339
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,808
Let's assume that there's a slight breeze,

340
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:07,206
on either day, okay,

341
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:09,760
but the temperature is either warm

342
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,451
or the temperature is cold, okay?

343
00:14:13,801 --> 00:14:14,705
Kelsey?

344
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:17,315
- I personally think that
it would be better

345
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,313
to be on a hot day,

346
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:21,762
because then the sun would be

347
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,764
helping with all the hot air

348
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,242
so then it would make the air
inside the hot air balloon

349
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,469
warmer to help it fly higher.

350
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:33,518
- So I'd get radiation into the balloon?

351
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,198
Okay. Ramaji.

352
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:37,756
- I think a cold day.

353
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:40,191
- And why on a cold day?

354
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:40,879
- Because, like,

355
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,441
there's not, I mean,

356
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,996
even on hot days,

357
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:47,366
there's still, like,
low humidity sometimes,

358
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:49,799
and so, like, it,

359
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,361
you basically with fire would kind of...

360
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:54,719
I don't know, not set your hair on fire,

361
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,322
but like...

362
00:14:55,322 --> 00:14:58,524
[laughter]

363
00:15:01,374 --> 00:15:04,361
No, when it's cold there's
no moisture in the air,

364
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,698
so like, it would be, like,

365
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,684
like helium, but like...

366
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:10,889
- Okay, Shayla?

367
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,427
- I think that it's a hot day.

368
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:15,557
One of the reasons is because

369
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,073
there's hot in the hot air balloon,

370
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:19,923
and if it was on a cold day,

371
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:23,000
there's a fire in the thing,

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,764
in the hot air balloon,

373
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:26,154
it could blow out the fire

374
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:27,501
and that could make the whole thing

375
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,604
just plummet to the ground,

376
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:29,916
and people could die.

377
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:30,876
- Okay.

378
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:33,080
Ann Maria?

379
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,264
- I think it would be
better on a cold day,

380
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:36,993
because, well, I don't know if

381
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:38,464
this actually really makes sense,

382
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:41,038
but, like, the hot air would be working

383
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,399
against the cold air--

384
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,314
- Exactly!

385
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,591
- And like if it's on a hot day

386
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,441
it would be like the same.

387
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,265
- Just a second.

388
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:51,595
So Ann Maria,

389
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:52,980
if the cold...

390
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,860
if the warm air is in
the hot air balloon,

391
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,902
and it's a cold day,

392
00:15:55,902 --> 00:15:58,725
what would you expect to
happen to the balloon?

393
00:15:58,725 --> 00:16:00,113
- Go up.

394
00:16:00,113 --> 00:16:02,870
- And why would you expect
the balloon to go up

395
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,894
on a cold day faster than on a hot day?

396
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:09,401
- Because...

397
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,397
like, the hot air would be...

398
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,679
pushing against the cold air,

399
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:18,406
faster than it would be
pushing against itself?

400
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:19,282
- Okay.

401
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:20,120
Over here.

402
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,196
- I agree with Shayla on the hot day,

403
00:16:24,196 --> 00:16:28,360
because, like, a regular air balloon,

404
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,523
just regular heat would make it go up,

405
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,804
but if you had the sun hitting against it,

406
00:16:33,804 --> 00:16:36,316
I think, it would help with radiation,

407
00:16:36,316 --> 00:16:39,915
like the sun would help out...

408
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:40,985
- The fire?

409
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:43,121
- Yeah, how it has something
to do with radiation.

410
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:44,951
- Okay.

411
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:47,320
- I think the sun hitting
against the balloon

412
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,801
would make it go up higher.

413
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,163
- Okay. Nathan?

414
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:51,438
- I think on a cold day,

415
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:55,995
because it would give it
less chance of popping

416
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,601
from the hot air,

417
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,732
that might pop it.

418
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:03,922
- Awesome.

419
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,924
Kevin, what do you think?

420
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,403
- I think the same, hot air,

421
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:12,081
because I've never seen
a hot air balloon

422
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,473
fly when it's cold.

423
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:15,803
- Okay. Dakota?

424
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,565
Oh wait, Kevin, I have a question for you.

425
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:20,078
How do you define a cold day?

426
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,521
Okay, what's the,

427
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:25,955
okay, here's my question, okay.

428
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,323
You said you'd never
seen a hot air balloon

429
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:30,021
fly on a cold day,

430
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,580
and what I'm asking is,

431
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,447
is there a particular
season that you would say

432
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,438
the air would be too cold?

433
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,309
- Winter.
- Winter, okay.

434
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:39,942
Dakota, what do you think?

435
00:17:39,942 --> 00:17:42,887
- Uh, I think, uh...

436
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:48,558
- Kevin, Dakota can think on his own.

437
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:49,931
I know he can.

438
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,764
- I don't know.

439
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,385
- Cold day, warm day,

440
00:17:58,385 --> 00:17:59,188
what do you think?

441
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:02,077
- I think a warm day,

442
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:05,375
because it would be easier to fly?

443
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:07,638
- Okay, Daniel, what do you think?

444
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:09,243
Cold day, warm day?

445
00:18:09,243 --> 00:18:10,679
- I would say a cold day,

446
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,205
because the hot air
would meet the cold air,

447
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:16,316
so it would be more enhanced,

448
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,840
going up you'd get more from the hot air.

449
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,479
- Okay, I need to kind of

450
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,586
bring this to a close real quick,

451
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,984
and I know you two have lots to say,

452
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:27,470
Tyree, did you want to
add the last comment?

453
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,795
- Yeah.

454
00:18:28,795 --> 00:18:30,757
Uh, I think the hot day,

455
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:34,278
because who would go out on a cold day,

456
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:35,757
when the higher you get,

457
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:37,084
the colder it gets.

458
00:18:37,084 --> 00:18:38,284
- Okay, Tyree says

459
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,322
who would go out on a cold day,

460
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:41,517
because the higher you get,

461
00:18:41,517 --> 00:18:42,825
the colder you get,

462
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:45,243
so Tyree's logic here is that

463
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,365
if I'm going to go in a hot air balloon,

464
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,162
I don't want to get really really cold.

465
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,156
Okay, ladies,

466
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:51,948
I know you have lots to add, okay,

467
00:18:51,948 --> 00:18:54,244
but I kind of want to
bring this to a close,

468
00:18:54,244 --> 00:18:56,957
but I need to know a crucial question.

469
00:18:56,957 --> 00:19:00,040
So everybody has to
commit to this question.

470
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,720
I want you to--

471
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,922
don't do it until I tell you to!

472
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:07,183
Ready?

473
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:10,837
You're gonna hold, um,

474
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:14,266
you're gonna hold your arm straight up

475
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:16,194
if you believe the better day

476
00:19:16,194 --> 00:19:17,997
would be the warm day,

477
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:20,123
and you're gonna hold your hand

478
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:21,998
at the side of your shoulder

479
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:24,150
if you believe it would
be the cold day

480
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,877
that would be the better day.

481
00:19:25,877 --> 00:19:27,330
I didn't say go yet!

482
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:30,152
Okay, on three, everybody.

483
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,284
So, does everybody understand?

484
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,125
This is cold,

485
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,201
this is warm, okay?

486
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:39,089
Ready, one, two, three.

487
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:43,797
Okay.

488
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:46,074
Okay, now hands down.

489
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,264
I have just two more questions,

490
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:51,239
and then we're gonna close
out today's lesson, okay.

491
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,873
Question number one.

492
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:58,521
I want to know if you've
ever heard the word...
