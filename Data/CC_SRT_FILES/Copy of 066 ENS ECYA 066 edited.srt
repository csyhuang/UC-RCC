- [Teacher] You could say, "give it back"

124

or doing something you don't like,

133
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,999
you can tell them to stop,

134
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,336
or leave me alone.

135
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:54,857
We can talk to who?

136
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:58,355

151
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:30,357
Sometime when we get mad it's
okay if we squeeze our hands.

152
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,586
That might help makes us feel better.

153
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,647
Make us calm down a little bit.

154

pancakes are things that are--

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,214
- [Kendrel] Coo-coo games
(Background Chatter)

161
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:53,558
- [Teacher] --red choices, things
that we don't want to do

162
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:57,412
when we're mad, and some of
my things are green choices,

163
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:02,250
and if it's a green choice,
we're gonna add it to our book.

164
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:04,897
If it's a red choice, we're
gonna put it on our plate.

165
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:06,848
Okay?

166
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:11,793
Alright, so, Jakiah you want to go first?

167
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:12,716
- [Jakiah] Yes.

168
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,635
- [Teacher] Alright, are you ready?

169
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,207
Alright, here you go, ma'am.

170
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:18,507
- [Jakiah] I want the pink one.

171
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:19,743
- [Kendrel] Flip it.

172
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:25,344
- [Teacher] Oh, that went 
way high past my head.

173
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,387
What is that boy doing?

174
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,611
- [Jakiah, Kendrel] (Background Chatter)

175
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:29,087
- [Teacher] Not your thing.

176
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,383
What is he doing?

177
00:06:30,383 --> 00:06:31,265
- [Jakiah] Bite

178
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:31,725
- [Teacher] He's biting.

179
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,256
Is he biting himself or his friends?

180
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:35,435
- [Jakiah] His friend.
- [Nick] His friend.

181
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:37,525
- [Teacher] His friend.

182
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,847
Is that something we want
to do when we're mad?

183
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:40,706
- [Nick] Yeah.

184
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:42,029
- [Teacher] Should we hurt our friends?

185
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:42,675
- [Kendrel] No!

186
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,624
- [Teacher] That is not
something we want to do

187
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:46,831
- [Kendrel] We need to be good.

188
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:49,223
- [Teacher] So, Jakiah does that 
go on our red choice plate, or

189
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,814
is that a green choice
that goes in our book?

190
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,760
- [Jakiah] It's the red choice.

191
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,587
- [Teacher] It is a red choice 
plate, you are right.

192
00:06:58,706 --> 00:07:00,883
All of our red choices go on our plate.

193
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,715
You were right that was a red choice.

194
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,898
Put is right on top.

195
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:08,104
Nice thank you, high five.

196
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:09,172
Good job!

197
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,094
Scoot back, sit down.

198
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,206
Alright, Nicholas are you ready?

199
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,151
Flip that thing.

200
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:18,868
I caught it.

201
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,840
What are they doing on there?

202
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,240
- [Nick](Background Chatter)

203
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,676
- [Teacher] They are smelling that 
flower, and blowing out the candle.

204
00:07:29,676 --> 00:07:31,209
Can you show me how to do that?

205
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:36,046
Smell your flowers. Now
put the hand on top.

206
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,290
Do it one more time for me.

207
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,500
Sometimes we need to stop
and take a deep breath

208
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,102
to calm ourselves down.

209
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:51,041
Nick, is that a red
choice or a green choice?

210
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:53,525
- [Nick] Green choice.

211
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,558
- [Teacher] It absolutely is a green choice.

212
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:57,486
Here's your sticky stuff.

213
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,483
I'm gonna put it right there.

214
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:01,962
Can you stick that picture
right on top please?

215
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,096
Our sticky tack

216
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,373
- [Kendrel] Sticky tack

217
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,632
- [Teacher] Put it on top, please.

218
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:08,727
- [Kendrel] Sticky tack

219
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,651
- [Jakiah] Sticky tack

220
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,509
- [Teacher] Good job.

221
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:15,676
- [Kendrel, Jakiah] Sticky tack

222
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:16,536
-[Teacher] Nice thinking.

223
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:16,833
Okay. High five.

224
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:18,934
Okay.

225
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:19,756
High five.

226
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,576
Nice work! Have a seat.

227
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:24,504
Alright, Kendrel Lowel, are you ready?

228
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,781
- [Kendrel] Yeah.

229
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:29,003
- [Teacher] What about...

230
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,603
this one?

231
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:33,549
- [Jakiah] Woah.

232
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,862
- [Teacher] Woah!

233
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:39,297
- [Kendrel] Somebody push 
somebody off the chair!

234
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,241
- [Teacher] Somebody pushed someone
else off that chair.

235
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,702
- [Kendrel] Somebody broke that head off.

236
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:46,838
Right there.

237
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,718
- [Teacher] It doesn't look like
he has a neck, does it?

238
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:50,725
You're right.

239
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:52,156
- [Kendrel] Woah.

240
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:52,466
- [Teacher] That's just weird.

241
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,479
Try and see me--

242
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:56,051
Criss-cross applesauce.

243
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:58,716
Jakiah show me criss-cross, please.

244
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:00,806
Thank you.

245
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,572
Alright, Kendrel, is that a
green choice or a red choice?

246
00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:05,385
- [Kendrel] Red choice.

247
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,237
- [Teacher] Absolutely, why is 
that a red choice?

248
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:10,024
- [Kendrel] because that is very bad.

249
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,916
Don't know when to snack, or

250
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,018
probably our friends at the playground.

251
00:09:16,018 --> 00:09:18,038
- [Teacher] Why is that a red choice?

252
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:21,730
- [Kendrel] Because they gonna get left.
- [Nick] (Background Chatter)

253
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,123
- [Teacher] Because it hurts their...

254
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:25,242
friends
- [Kendrel] Friends!

255
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,769
-[Teacher] It hurts their friends.

256
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:30,475
- [Kendrel](Background Chatter) that
pushed somebody off the chair.

257
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:33,201
- [Teacher] Yep, Alright, Jakiah, Jakiah.

258
00:09:33,815 --> 00:09:35,458
Kendrel where does that one go?

259
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,648
- [Kendrel] On the red.

260
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:39,522
- [Teacher] On the red choice plate.
You're absolutely right.

261
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,633
Alright, miss Jakiah, flip that pancake.

262
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:44,444
- [Jakiah] Boom!

263
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:47,793
- [Teacher] What is he doing?

264
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:48,792
- [Nick] Numbers!

265
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,138
- [Teacher] Numbers. They are?

266
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,787
- [Jakiah] One, two, three.

267
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,709
- [Teacher] And what are they 
doing, they're...?

268
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:55,195
Counting.

269
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,052
Can you help me count to ten?

270
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,841
- [All] One, two, three,

271

seven, eight, nine,

273
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:12,259
ten.

274
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:14,100
- [Teacher] If we get really 
mad at our friends,

275
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,066
can we stop what we're doing,

276
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,583
take a deep breath and count to ten

277
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,300
to help calm ourselves down?

278
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,986
- [Jakiah] Yes

279
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,285
- [Teacher] Would that be a green
choice or a red choice?

280
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,864
- [Nick] Green choice!

281
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,716
- [Teacher] Absolutely, 
it is a green choice.

282
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:32,390
Jakiah, is that a green
choice or a red choice?

283
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,323
- [Kendrel] Red choice

284
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:34,294
- [Jakiah] A red choice.

285
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:35,436
- [Teacher] Is it a red choice to count?

286
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:36,643
- [Kendrel] No.

287
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:38,379
- [Teacher] Does that hurt our friends
if we stop and count?

288
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:39,888
- [All] No.

289
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,253
- ]Teacher] So, that's a green choice.

290
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,186
Something we can add to our book.

291
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:44,834
- [Jakiah] Though it's the red choice.

292
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:45,944
- [Teacher] That's a green choice.

293
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:47,401
We can stop and count.

294
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,538
Our red choices are--
- [Jakiah] That's a green

295
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:50,481
- [Teacher] --things that may hurt ourselves--
- [Jakiah] choice and a green

296
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:51,869
--or our friends.
- [Jakiah] choice.

297
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:53,077
[Teacher] It is a green choice.

298
00:10:53,077 --> 00:10:55,203
Can you put it right there on
our sticky tack in our book?

299
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:56,991
- [Jakiah] Sticky tack

300
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,663

303
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:03,766
- (Background Chatter)

304
00:11:04,003 --> 00:11:05,577

306
00:11:06,877 --> 00:11:08,317

307
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,817
Lets see what else--
- [Jakiah] You're sticky.

308
00:11:09,817 --> 00:11:11,352
-[Teacher] --we can do.

309
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:15,291

310
00:11:18,604 --> 00:11:19,596
-[All] Oh.

311
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:21,180
- [Nick](laughing)

312
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,550
- [Teacher] What are they doing?

313
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,706
- [Jakiah] Walking
- [Nick] Walking.

314
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,029
- [Teacher] They're taking a walk.

315
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:28,866
If we get really mad and we
just need to get away from

316
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,904
our friends for a minute, is it okay if

317
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:32,710
you come ask me to take a walk?

We could walk around the hallways.

Alright, so let's look at some
of the things that we have

336
00:12:07,638 --> 00:12:08,725
that we can do.

337
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:10,995
Can you scoot way over here
so your friends can see?

338
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,222
Alright, you guys, help me read this.

339
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:19,767

We can talk to who?

350

Jakiah, who else can we talk to?

took my toy and

355
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,673
they will not give it back,

356
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,647
or someone hit me--

- [Teacher] Alright,

359
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:58,657

360
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:02,860

then blow that candle away.

366
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:14,990
- [Teacher] We can stop and take a deep breath.

367
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,266
Smell that flower,

368
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,252
blow out that candle.

369
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,106
Deep breath. Smell that flower.

370
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:29,298

372
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,119
- [Teacher] Push those hands, how
hard can you squeeze them?

373
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,415
Jakiah, can you show me?

374
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,665
Nick's squeezing, Kendrel's squeezing.

375
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,566
Alright we could ask our teachers to what?

376
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,515
- [Kendrel] They get a walk!

377
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,043
- [Teacher] To take a walk.

378
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,673
Sometimes we may just need to

379
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,689
to get out of our classroom and that is okay.

380
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:53,705

00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:58,372
used your words and told him.

384
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,281
You told him that you were screaming and

385
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:01,299
that hurt my ears.

386
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,086
Alright, using your words--

387
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:04,178

- [Teacher] Count.

394
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:12,575

00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,203
- [Teacher] It makes my teachers happy when

400
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:36,518
