[Background Chatter]

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,110
- [Instructor] So, who can tell me, in
this group, who can remind me, what is our

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,370
objective? What are we discovering today
in science? I'd like to see a lot of

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:28,110
volunteers. Lindsey?

5
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:35,220
- [Lindsey] We're seeing what soil holds
water better and...

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,070
- We're seeing which soil holds water
better. What's the term for that? Holds

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,470
water? Chris.

8
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,200
- [Chris] It's absorbing the water.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,690
- What's absorbing the water?

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,410
- The clay and the sand absorb the water.

11
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:56,700
- Very good. So we're trying to figure out
which absorbs more water. Clay or sand,

12
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,400
today? Very good. Who can tell me what was
the first step that you did in this

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,780
project? Cameron.

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,510
- [Cameron] First, we poured in the sand.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,045
- What did you pour the sand into?

16
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:12,901
- We poured it into a funnel.

17
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:16,293
- Okay. What's that thing on the funnel?

18
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,380
- It's a coffee filter.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,420
- It's a coffee filter. Why do we need a
coffee filter on the funnel?

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:30,030
- Because when it's on the funnel it makes
it so that the sand doesn't run through

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,760
the funnel.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,790
- Okay. All right. What's the second step?
Can somebody tell me what the second step

23
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,870
is? Cameron said you dump the soil sample,
whether it was clay or sand, into your

24
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,330
funnel. What's the second step? Caleb.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,070
- [Caleb] The second second step is to
pour in the water.

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,780
- The second step was to pour in the
water. Who can tell me what the third step

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,580
is? What's the third step? Chris.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:02,070
- You record how long it took for it to
drip every last drop into the cup of

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,090
water.

30
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,510
- What's it?
- The water.

31
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,760
- The water. Good. You're recording how
long it took for all of the

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:18,100
water... what's that word called? What
did that water do to get from here to the

33
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,960
surface to the bottom of the cup? Cameron?

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,830
- It drained.

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,250
- It drained. Very good. What are you
measuring in? Are you measuring in

36
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,900
seconds? Are you measuring in minutes? In
hours? Lindsey?

37
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,220
- Measuring in minutes with the seconds.

38
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,440
- You're measuring in minutes with
seconds. Okay. Can you tell me how long

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,520
your clay is up to for draining out the
water?

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,490
- Two minutes and a half.

41
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:45,610
- Two and a half minutes. Good. Can you
tell me, Cameron, how long it took for

42
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,480
your water to drain through your sand?

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,644
- It took 28 seconds.

44
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:55,640
- Twenty-eight seconds. Good job. Keep up
the good work. I really like all the

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,960
diagrams that I'm seeing. Lindsey, you did
an excellent job at paying very close

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,870
attention and following the steps, in
step-by-step order. You can give yourself

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:14,380
a point for science. Good job.
[Soft Background Chatter]

48
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,000
Ladies, can you tell me did your sand hold
water?

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,520
- [Luana] Yes.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,370
- It did hold water. How did you know
that?

51
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,560
- Because it absorbs some of the water. I
poured it in here and it had

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:44,760
29... there's 29 left and I did 42
into the water, so the sand holds 11

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,540
milliliters of water.

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,150
- Good. So you're saying that the sand
held 11 milliliters of water. You said

55
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,210
that when you poured the water in through
the sand then you dumped something in this

56
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,000
graduated cylinder. What did you dump in
this graduated cylinder?

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,410
- [Student] We dumped all the water that
was in there.

58
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,810
- What's there?
- In the cup.

59
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,600
- So you dumped all the water that was in
the cup after what? What did the water do

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,840
in order to get in the cup?

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,251
- It drained through the funnel, through
the sand, down into the cup.

62
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,980
- So it drained through the funnel,
through the sand, down into the cup. So

63
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,787
then you took your water and you poured it
in your graduated cylinder. Luana, you

64
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:33,930
said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11
milliliters? Why did you do 40 minus 29?

65
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:41,397
- Because that's how you find out how much
the sand is holding.

66
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,390
- That's how you find out how much the
sand is holding? How did you know to start

67
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,140
with 40?

68
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,210
- Because we poured 40 milliliters of
water in the cup to start.

69
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,320
- Oh. To start, you poured 40 milliliters
of water in. You took the water that you

70
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,756
had to start and took away the amount that
was left, which you got 11 milliliters.

71
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:03,676
Very good. Excellent.

72
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:10,730
Gentlemen, what are you noticing about
sand and water?

73
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,610
- [Student] We're noticing, about the
sand, this time it took us two minutes and

74
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:27,274
eight seconds for it to stop dripping. We
started out with 40 milliliters and...

75
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:30,180
- What did you do with that 40 milliliters
of water?

76
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:38,900
- We poured it into the strainer to drain
it down into the cup and when we poured

77
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:46,708
into the cylinder we had 28 and a half
milliliters.

78
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:50,760
- Very good. How do you figure out how
much water is in the sand. What

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,500
subtraction sentence would you do?

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,130
- Forty minus 30.

81
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,360
- So you're rounding up. You said you had
29 and a half. Are you going to round that

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,000
to 30?
- Yes.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,610
- That's a very good choice.
You're going to do 40 minus 30 so that

84
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:11,480
tells you how much water is in the sand,
which is?

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,130
- One, 10.
- Ten what?

86
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,140
- Milliliters.

87
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:20,670
- Ten milliliters. Very good. Do you think
some of that water's still in the funnel?

88
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,730
Because this funnel is still dry. This
funnel feels wet. Do you think some of

89
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,890
that 10 milliliters of water is in
this... not funnel, in this filter?

90
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,280
- Yes.

91
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,360
- Do you think so? Why do you think that?

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,630
- Because it's soaked and some of the
water might have stopped in there because

93
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,910
it was so thick and sandy.

94
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,360
- And now it's a little bit thinner? Keep
up the great work.

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:57,670
[Soft Background Chatter]
Sam and Madison, what are you noticing

96
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,970
about water with your sand and water with
your clay?

97
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:12,600
- [Sam] The sand drains the water faster
than the clay.

98
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,160
- The sand drains the water faster than
the clay. Have you figured out yet which

99
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,190
one holds more water?
- Clay.

100
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,700
- The clay holds more water. If you were a
gardener and if you were planting a

101
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,260
garden, what would you rather garden with?
Would you rather garden with sand or would

102
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,610
you rather garden with clay?

103
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,970
- Sand.
- Why's that?

104
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:39,720
- Because it drains water better and the
drainage would get to the plants faster.

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,441
- Okay. So the drainage would get to the
plants faster. Where do the plants need

106
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:47,525
the water?
- Roots.

107
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:50,470
- At the roots. What do you think,
Madison?

108
00:07:50,470 --> 00:08:03,280
- [Madison] I would do a mixture of sand,
clay, and humus because mixed together

109
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:11,650
it's loamy and loamy soil is good for the
plants.

110
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,000
- Great observation. That's wonderful. So
you said you'd mix all of them together

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,050
because that would make a loamy mixture
which would allow the gardeners to get the

112
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,180
best soil for the plants to grow. Very
good. Nice job. What are you three

113
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,612
noticing about water and sand and water
and clay?

114
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:46,638
- [Student] Water and sand, it can absorb
through the sand, the water. And through

115
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:54,900
the clay it soaks and [inaudible] at four
minutes.

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:01,250
- You're almost at four minutes for your
clay. Wow. What do you think this shows

117
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,940
you about what happens on a rainy day
whether it's outside in our soccer field?

118
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,720
Or what happens on a rainy day in your
backyard? Does anybody want to tell me

119
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,340
what happens?

120
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:23,520
- The clay, it gets very muddy because the
water is pouring down on it. It might make

121
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:38,860
a puddle because some of the soil on the
ground can't hold itself so it might make

122
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,044
a puddle.

123
00:09:40,044 --> 00:09:44,560
- Good. So Matthew, when you poured your
water into your clay, did you have a

124
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,230
puddle at the top of your clay?

125
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:55,130
- [Matthew] Yeah, we had a puddle at the
top of our clay because it was leaking

126
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:02,450
little drops and it stayed on top of the
clay. We had to wait a long time till we

127
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,080
could pour more water.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,220
- What stayed for a long time on top of
the clay?

129
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:17,460
- The water did because it didn't have
small particle sizes so it was hard for

130
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,760
the water to get through.

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,370
- Oh, so the clay has small particle sizes
so it's hard for the water to get through.

132
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,470
Wow. Good job. What does that mean about
the particle size for the sand?

133
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:37,110
- It means that the particle for sand is
bigger and it has more space for the water

134
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,454
to drain through.

135
00:10:38,454 --> 00:10:45,368
- Good. Excellent. Did any of you draw
diagrams of what your experiment set-up

136
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:50,260
looked like?
- What it looked like?

137
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,830
- I think you have a diagram on the
previous page. Did you draw a diagram?

138
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,030
- Yes.

139
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,960
- Okay. What did your diagram show?

140
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:09,500
- My diagram, for sand, shows that the
water is going right through the funnel

141
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:20,980
and it's pouring to the bottom. And for my
clay it's little drops because the clay is

142
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,510
stuck together once it has water.

143
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,810
- Good. I can easily tell, in your
diagram, which one's sand and which one's

144
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:32,070
clay. One suggestion that I can make to
you, though, is I would like a few more

145
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,550
labels. If I were to never see this
experiment before, how would I know that

146
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,660
this is sand and that this is clay? So if you
could label those for me and tell me what

147
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,050
these drops are. I don't know if they're
water, or [inaudible] or milk. If you

148
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,350
could do a little bit more labelling for
me, that would be excellent. Good job.

149
00:11:52,350 --> 00:12:00,180
Nice work. Very impressive.
[Soft Background Chatter]

150
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,816
How long are you guys up to for your water
being through your filter, through your

151
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:07,050
clay?

152
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,760
- [Xavier] Five minutes and 45 seconds.

153
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,590
- Five minutes and 45 seconds. I can tell
that both of you are working very hard.

154
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,960
And Xavier, you're doing excellent job at
staying in your seat the whole time. You

155
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,570
can give yourself a point right now for
being on task. Nice job. Good.

156
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,750
What are you noticing about sand, clay and
water?

157
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,170
- [Student] I noticed that the clay held
less water than the sand and I was really

158
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:41,730
surprised by that because I thought that
water can go through sand fast.

159
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,930
- So you were really surprised because you
didn't think water would go through sand

160
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,414
that fast? And how much water did your
sand hold?

161
00:12:49,414 --> 00:12:53,862
- Our sand held 11 milliliters.

162
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:57,734
- Eleven milliliters. Good. And how much
did your clay hold, do you know?

163
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:58,630
- [Kendall] Five.

164
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:07,390
- Held five milliliters. Wow. What number
sentence did you do in order to figure out

165
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,874
how many milliliters were in the clay and
how many milliliters were in the sand?

166
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:18,531
- We did 40 minus however the milliliters
were left in the cup.

167
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,258
- Okay. And why did you do that?

168
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:31,139
- Because we had 40 to begin with and we
needed to find out how many were left

169
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:38,626
and... I forgot.

170
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:41,474
- You forgot? Kendall, can you help her
out?

171
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:54,113
- We got 29 in this and it began
with 40. So we had to do 40 minus 29.

172
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:59,120
Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters.

173
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,530
- Milliliters.
Good. Remember millimeters is when we're

174
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:10,360
using rulers and milliliters is when we're
measuring water. Okay? Excellent job.

175
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,946
Which soil would you rather garden with?
Would you rather garden with sand or would

176
00:14:16,946 --> 00:14:18,514
you rather garden with clay?

177
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:29,894
- I would garden with both of them so I could get a 
loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers.

178
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:33,289
- Okay. So you would mix them together so
that you could get a loamy mixture. What

179
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,474
about you, Kendall?

180
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:39,850
- I would do sand because water can get
through it easily.

181
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,340
- So water can get through it easily? Why
would that matter?

182
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:51,677
- Because the soil and everything else,
and the grass and everything, needs water

183
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:57,407
but if you use clay it just stays on top
and it can't get water.

184
00:14:57,407 --> 00:15:00,410
- Very good. Excellent. Looks like you
girls are ready to move on to your

185
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,247
graphing. What are we going to graph? What
are we graphing today?

186
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:11,000
- How much water is in the...
