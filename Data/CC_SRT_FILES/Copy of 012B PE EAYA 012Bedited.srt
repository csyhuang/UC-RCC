1
00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:04,569
- Now, what you just did

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:07,726
was

3
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:09,050
count how many times

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,649
you made a successful...

5
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,761
Eric...

6
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,854
...you made a successful throw

7
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,710
and how many times you
made a successful catch,

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,657
out of 10.

9
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:21,541
All right, we're going
to use that information

10
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,306
that you just gathered

11
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:25,765
to answer the questions on
this form that you've got.

12
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,829
You each should have your
own reflection sheet,

13
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:30,129
all right,

14
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,965
and I'm going to allow you to

15
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,309
as a group, as a partnership,

16
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,285
I'm going to allow you to

17
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,048
talk about the answers
together, which is just fine,

18
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:42,412
because with your partner helping you,

19
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:44,340
you might learn something

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,476
about your throwing ability,
or catching ability,

21
00:00:46,476 --> 00:00:49,008
that you might not have
picked up on your own.

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,328
All right so... [inaudible]

23
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:53,720
Now,

24
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,808
if you look at the backside,

25
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,431
if you start here,

26
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:01,476
[inaudible]

27
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:05,936
each of you should have
your sheet in front of you,

28
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,304
OK

29
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,255
and you should have a pencil

30
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,715
or you have [inaudible]

31
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,807
and I'm going to read this to you

32
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,895
to help you best understand it.

33
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:19,227
This is a chart to help you gauge

34
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:22,607
your abilities

35
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,254
and for your progress

36
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:27,810
from the start of throwing
the Frisbee up to this point.

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,638
It's broken up into four categories.

38
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:34,958
One, you see where I'm pointing at here.

39
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,862
It says, Beginning;

40
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:38,650
Two, Developing;

41
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,346
Three, Proficient;

42
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:42,154
and Four, Excellent.

43
00:01:42,154 --> 00:01:45,522
So the question you
have to ask yourself is,

44
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,934
"Am I still in beginning
stages of throwing Frisbee?"

45
00:01:49,934 --> 00:01:53,998
In other words, do I use
correct Frisbee throwing form

46
00:01:53,998 --> 00:01:57,366
sometimes?

47
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:01,078
Two, it says, "Do I use correct form

48
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:04,701
"some to most of the time?"

49
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,533
Three, proficient.

50
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,021
Do I use correct form
when throwing the Frisbee

51
00:02:09,021 --> 00:02:10,041
or catching the Frisbee

52
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,529
most of the time?

53
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:13,452
And four, excellent.

54
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:17,356
Do I use correct form all of the time?

55
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:18,701
All right.

56
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:20,585
So this is what you are
going to test yourself on.

57
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:21,580
I'll read it to you,

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,648
and as I read it to you I
want you to mark the boxes.

59
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:26,760
Again, you can talk to your partner

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,219
and make this assessment with
your partner if you'd like.

61
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,936
So sitting with your partner,
you're talking about it.

62
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,168
I'm going to read it as we go.

63
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:36,232
Number one, movement.

64
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:43,639
Do you move to meet the
Frisbee's expected location?

65
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,475
Are you at the beginning stages of that,

66
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:48,051
developing stages, proficient stages,

67
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,907
or are you excellent at it?

68
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:52,391
Do you always move to meet
the Frisbee's location?

69
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:59,890
Sometimes, most of the time, or rarely?

70
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,403
Give yourself a check in the box

71
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:02,935
of where you think that belongs.

72
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:06,046
Body position.

73
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,582
OK, this is how you position yourself

74
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,043
to the oncoming Frisbee

75
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:10,458
aside from moving to it,

76
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,826
this is how you square your body with it.

77
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,543
Are you in the beginning stages,

78
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:16,194
where you rarely do it well,

79
00:03:16,194 --> 00:03:17,866
are you in the developing stages,

80
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,398
where you do it sometimes,

81
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:22,670
the proficient stages, where
you do it most of the time,

82
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,966
or are you in the excellent
stage where you do it

83
00:03:26,966 --> 00:03:28,521
all of the time?

84
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:29,914
Ask yourself that question.

85
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:31,934
Feel free to discuss it with your partner.

86
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:34,093
All right, so you should
be checking the boxes.

87
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:35,905
You should be checking the boxes.

88
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:38,065
That's right there.

89
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:40,201
- [Student in gray] The
boxes are already checked.

90
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,781
- Next,

91
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,869
Hand position.

92
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:46,898
When catching the Frisbee,

93
00:03:46,898 --> 00:03:49,498
do you use proper hand positioning

94
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:51,934
with your palms together, fingers opening,

95
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:53,909
rarely?

96
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,230
That makes you in the beginning stage.

97
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,321
Sometimes?

98
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,757
That's your developing stage.

99
00:04:00,757 --> 00:04:04,357
Do you do it most of the time?

100
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,817
That puts you in the proficient stage.

101
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,257
Do you do it always?

102
00:04:08,257 --> 00:04:10,209
That puts you in the excellent stage.

103
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,181
What do you think? What is your target?

104
00:04:12,181 --> 00:04:14,665
What would you put a grade on?

105
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:17,660
Now when it comes to the throwing,

106
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,588
the same things apply.

107
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:21,792
Your stance

108
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,584
and your elbow.

109
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,252
Are you at the beginning?

110
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,440
And I'm not going to go into detail

111
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,320
with each one of these now,

112
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,688
I think you get the idea of
how these check [inaudible].

113
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,243
Are you at the beginning stage,

114
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:33,612
the developing stage,
the proficient stage,

115
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:34,935
or the excellent stage?

116
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:39,695
When it comes to your stance
and your elbow position.

117
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:43,132
When it comes to wrist snap and point

118
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:44,223
OK

119
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,383
what stage are you at?

120
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:49,795
Are you rarely, sometimes,
mostly, or always?

121
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:53,232
Again, beginning, developing,
proficient, or excellent?

122
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:56,136
And then lastly, when it
comes to releasing the Frisbee

123
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,712
what stage do you think you're at:

124
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,244
the beginning, the developing,

125
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:03,960
the proficient, or the excellent?

126
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,274
So I want you to just think about that

127
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:07,624
reflect on that,

128
00:05:07,624 --> 00:05:09,496
but I'm not grading you on this.

129
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:11,913
I'm not grading you on your ability.

130
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:14,976
Hey, Mike, would you sit up for me?

131
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:16,716
Thanks bud.

132
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,088
I want you just to reflect on

133
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:22,500
what you have learned and your ability.

134
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,104
All right?

135
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,820
Now, with your partner,

136
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,376
I want you to turn the page over

137
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:31,740
and it says Frisbee throw reflections, OK,

138
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,016
and then we have some questions
that we need to answer.

139
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,823
We discussed what angular momentum was,

140
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:39,775
we discussed what force absorption was,

141
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:43,757
and we discussed what force reduction was.

142
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,607
With your partner, I want
you to answer those questions

143
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,719
that you see, one through seven.

144
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,063
Number one: why is angular
momentum important?

145
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:56,475
Two: describe force reduction.

146
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:59,867
Three: describe force absorption.

147
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:03,791
Four: considering...[inaudible]

148
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,274
You don't have to do this...

149
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:08,618
I'm just reading them out
loud before you do it.

150
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,823
Considering the fitness
components of speed, agility,

151
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:14,426
endurance, and balance,

152
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:17,954
to which sports would you
compare Ultimate Frisbee?

153
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:20,114
If you think about when
we were playing Ultimate,

154
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,506
the game of Ultimate,

155
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,366
what sports would you compare that to?

156
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,778
- [Student offscreen] Football!

157
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,463
- No, you have...

158
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:28,878
do it with your partner.

159
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,758
And a couple more questions.

160
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:34,867
Where can Frisbee be played for fun?

161
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:37,678
What are two popular Frisbee activities

162
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,650
that you are aware of?

163
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,134
You already know one
that we played in class.

164
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:45,478
You might know of another two.

165
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:47,871
And then lastly,

166
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:51,770
based on the activity you
did just before we sat here,

167
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,626
how many times did you
catch your Frisbee out of 10

answering those questions
