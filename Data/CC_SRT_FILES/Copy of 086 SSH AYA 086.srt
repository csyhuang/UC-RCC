1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,900
- [Instructor] Present your position to the
other side. Make sure that you include the

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,270
SFI that backs up your position. Okay?
After that three minutes, we'll swap


3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:12,457
sides. All right. So, three minutes, pros
go right ahead.

4
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:17,000
[Background Chatter]

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
- We're talking about how minorities have made
a lot of progress since Reconstruction,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,500
and political things. Originally, there was 
no black senators or congressman, but after 

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Reconstruction, around 1865, there was two black senators
and fourteen congressmen, and now there's four black senators

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,700
and I'm sure more black congressmen. 
- It's like quadruple the representatives. 

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:51,000
- And other minorities are representative-- represented
in the House and Senate, so they've made a lot of 

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
progress becoming a representative government. 

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
[Background Chatter]

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
- They didn't have the knowledge of earlier. 

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So that's one way Reconstruction positively affected 
education in the South... in America...

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,700
[Background Chatter]

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,000
Also these statistics show that even though... 

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
even though certain states are slightly low
on the circulation per capita statistics

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Virginia is number fifteen, which is relatively high for  
a Southern state. 

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Except Florida is number thirty-four.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,500
And not all Northern states were held higher than--  
education held higher than Southern states. 

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Like Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware, 
which are all Northern states,  

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,000
are in relatively low positions on the scale. 

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:04,000
[Background Chatter]

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,500
- And former slaves were able to kind of give back 
more to the culture, and they influenced technology,

24
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,000
and science, and advances in those. And kind of
started influencing culture in the South and 

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
kind of in all the United States. 

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,700
[Background Chatter]

27
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,000
So... and it really basically spread freedom
through the South and finally gave the former 

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
former slaves a voice and a place in the country. 
And finally brought them together. 

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
[Background Chatter]

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Y'all have anything else? 

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
- [Boy]: I found...
- [Girl]: The ones... they could like

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
progress forward and they could [inaudible]...  
because they have so many African-American positions

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and authors for that... for that. 

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think, overall, it finally gave blacks a place
and gave the South a place in the country again, 

35
00:03:08,000 -->00:03:13,000
where they had been separated for so long. 
Kind of started bringing everybody together again. 

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,010
- Because after the Civil War, the South still thought

37
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,210
that 'We don't have to cooperate with the North...' 
[Timer Beeps]

38
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:32,150
- All right, guys. That was pro. All
right. Three minutes, let's here the anti.

39
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,600
Three minutes and then we'll after...
Listen real quick, guys. After this three

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,530
minutes, we'll give it another minute,
okay, and one more minute after that for a

41
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:48,000
rebuttal, okay. For the final statement of
the pros, okay? Go ahead, antis.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- 1865 [inaudible] time of Reconstruction and
during... nothing really got done. 

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you look at the statistics, the infant mortality
in Mississippi is number one and if you go on to the 

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
lifestyle statistics, Mississippi is the very... has the
least number of museums, concert halls, and observatories

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in city centers, showing the link between Reconstruction
and just how it affected the South and how nothing got done 

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
after the Civil War. 

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
- [Instructor]: Let me, I'm sorry to interrupt, 
let me ask you this...

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,500
What caused... I mean, there had to have been something
I mean... during Reconstruction, everything was progressing.

49
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:39,000
Something happened to cause that overwhelming  
shift in numbers that you just pointed out  

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That, you know, the Southern states - the old 
Confederate states - dominated the bottom of that poll. 

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why do you think that is?

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why would that happen?
- Because the North is trying to punish the South.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
after the Civil War.
- They're more focused on helping themselves 

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and not helping the South

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- Because they're more focused on slavery than 
actually trying the help the South because they

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
were trying to punish them. So they didn't...
They were trying the free the slaves

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,900
they weren't trying to help the South because
they didn't want them to become stronger, also.

58
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,000
- [Instructor]: Was there a particular event that really 
solidified this, that really made that come to fruition?

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,700
[Background Chatter]

60
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,500
What is it the time frame of your question?

61
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,900
- 1865 to 1877

62
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,500
- Okay, so...

63
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
- During Reconstruction.
- Right.

64
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,000
So what happened at the end of Reconstruction? 
Why 1877?  

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,500
[Background Chatter]

66
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
What happened in 1877?

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
[Background Chatter]

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
- They took the military out of the South. 

69
00:05:45,000 -->00:05:46,000
- Exactly

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
[Background Chatter]

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, if the military was pulled out, what do you 
think caused this result? 

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
[Background Chatter]

73
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,000
- ...economic constraints imposed by Northern owners 
and eventual overseas competition hampered development

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and Birmingham never developed into the world-class
steel-making center that it was supposed to be.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:19,300
So yeah, it did sort of improve, but it just 
never reached its potential because, and it even says

76
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,000
hampered by Northern constraints. So the North basically
said you can't produce more steel because we say so.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So you can't... so Birmingham just couldn't really get
any better at that point. 

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,700
[Background Chatter]

79
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:49,000
- So the South has more industry now, like everything in
the South is [timer beeps] in the lower twenty-eight percent.

80
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,420
- Okay, guys, listen. We're going to give
you one more minute. You have a one minute

81
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,480
period, the pros, if you want to add a
little rebuttal to what you just heard,

82
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,270
okay. After this minute we're going to
take two minutes to compile our final

83
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,980
position, okay, like our final little
thesis, all right, that we're going to

84
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,210
present then to the class. Okay. So one
minute for a rebuttal from the pros. Go

85
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,009
ahead.

86
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:20,000
[Background Chatter]

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,700
- Because, since the military left, everybody revolted, so...
- They had no motivation.

88
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:31,700
- Everything that had been implemented for those years
went out the window and... [laughter]

89
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:40,210
- But I think it's still, a positive way, was that it at 
least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order 

90
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:47,000
and the South still kind of had gotten a taste from the 
military on how the Americans wanted things run and how 

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
they needed to do to function as America and...
so I think that mostly the military Reconstruction 

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
like that was good, because it kind of came in and 
helped them that way. 

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:11,000
[Background Chatter]

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
- [Instructor]: What is the number of African-American
senators and representatives?

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What does it show? What is the difference between 
Reconstructive-Era... [timer beeps]... huge difference.

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,910
- All right, guys, listen up. You get two
minutes. I need each side to compile your

97
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,920
final argument, okay, your final
statement. This is what you're going to

98
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,970
present to the rest of the class. Remember
you need SFI to back up your position,

99
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:44,020
okay. That SFI can be census data. More
importantly, it can be book data. Okay.

100
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,880
Just normal, normal information from your
text. So two minutes, go ahead and write

101
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,803
it out if you want. Go.

102
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:58,000
[Background Chatter]

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Each side comes up with their final points.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:27,500
[Background Chatter]

105
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:41,000
- We could go into more detail on the three-fifths compromise
and we could mention the Ku Klux Klan intimidated... even though
they got the vote, they were still controlled by the white people.

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
- Yeah, the social system still was there. 
OK, I'll write that down.

107
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
[Background Chatter]

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
- Could this be applied too?
- [Instructor]: Absolutely

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Remember, you have to explain to the class in 
a way that they can understand it, okay? 

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
They don't have that particular census data in
front of them. So make sure that you're clear 

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,700
when you present that as SFI in front of the class.

112
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:24,750
[Background Chatter]

113
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:35,000
- Tell them how many libraries and [Background Chatter]
- Virginia is the only one that's in the top fifty percent.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:56,000
- Completed out of fifty, and so... [Background Chatter]
All the Southern states are in the bottom... [Background Chatter]

115
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And then, this is trying to say, what? Twenty-five right here? 
Oh, so the bottom twenty-five, half... [Background Chatter]

116
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Existing at the time, which was... [Background Chatter]
Should we tell them that these states aren't... [Background Chatter]

117
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
or should we just not tell them? [Background Chatter]
- No, I would just... [Background Chatter]

118
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:57,000
[Background Chatter]

119
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
- Most African-Americans that were unskilled at the time, 
worked through this program to become more independent workers 

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:18,090
and to learn to read and write, and so...
I'll go back to my statistics here, Virginia and Florida
[timer beeps]

121
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,560
All right, guys, we're going to go in this
order. Listen up. We're going to go in

122
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,200
this order. We're going to go economic,
then social, political, then educational.

123
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,410
Okay. The pros are going to give their
positions first to the class. All right?

124
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,590
Now, the chart that you have in front of
you, what I want you guys to do is while

125
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,590
the rest of the groups are presenting
their findings, their positions, I want

126
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:51,200
you to take down three different pieces of
information that you hear, specific pieces

127
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,120
of information that you guys hear from the
presenter. All right. Because you're going

128
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,120
to use this when you formulate your own
response at the end of class to how you

129
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,090
feel about, you know, the efficacy of
Reconstruction, based on what you've heard.

130
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,840
Okay. You're going to make your decision,
so you need to make sure that you have

131
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,960
information down to support that, okay, to
support your idea. And make sure you're

132
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,700
getting that from their presentations. All
right? So we're going to go with economic

133
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,090
first. Economic pro, you have two minutes.
Camille, you it?

134
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,910
- [Camille] Yeah.

135
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,220
- All right. Everybody listen to Camille.

136
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,100
- Okay. So we came up with a thesis and it
was, "Reconstruction positively affected

137
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,089
America economically by bringing a broader
selection of products to the South and

138
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,795
North. And the North was trying to find
ways to help the South with the 13th and

139
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:48,611
14th Amendments." And so, Birmingham, and
Alabama, and Mississippi, and everyone,

140
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:54,191
they started mining for coal, and iron,
and everything, and so that helped their

141
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:57,201
economies because they were able to make
more money with that instead of just

142
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,405
cotton.
And the North put a few restrictions on

143
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:07,609
that, but that still helped their economy
for more products. And the North

144
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:16,367
manufactured more, like, grain. And we
talked about other things that weren't

145
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:23,114
really economic. That was about it,
that we could come up with.

146
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:31,372
- Okay. Thank you. All right.
Anti? Who is our speaker today? Okay,

147
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,234
Grant, go ahead.

148
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:38,590
- [Grant] All right. So you mentioned the
steel, and iron, and coal industries, and

149
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,010
yes, those did help. But at the same time,
the North industries, the North's economy

150
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,170
was growing, and it was growing faster
than the South. And there was the whole

151
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,290
economic deals with inflation, where... So
the South basically was making more, like

152
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,510
a higher number of dollars, but it
essentially was the same work as before

153
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,000
the war.
