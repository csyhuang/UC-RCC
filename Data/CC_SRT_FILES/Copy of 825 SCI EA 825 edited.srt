1
00:00:01,103 --> 00:00:02,047
- In case you think

2
00:00:02,047 --> 00:00:03,556
there's something missing, and then

3
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:05,158
we'll see what you got.

4
00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:05,832
- Okay.

5
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:07,364
- The tongue does with the [Inaudible].

6
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:08,804
- The tongue?

7
00:00:12,404 --> 00:00:15,398
Oh yeah, because the
trachea will swallow it.

8
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:16,675
No, the trachea's the air....

9
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,316
- The esophagus close your...

10
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:27,356
- The esophagus is the
food pipe for the thing.

11
00:00:27,356 --> 00:00:31,675
- No, the esophagus is the
thing that stops the food...

12
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:33,393
- The esophagus is the food part,

13
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:35,041
the windpipe is the trachea.

14
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,969
- You talking about the epiglottis.

15
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,594
- Oh, the epiglottis!

16
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:40,335
- That's the flap of skin that stops it,

17
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:44,004
food going down your
trachea, your air passageway.

18
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:46,465
- So you don't choke.

19
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:47,440
- Right.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,880
- How do you spell that?

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,266
- How do you spell what?

22
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,425
- Are you gonna put that
in there somewhere?

23
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,375
Well, here's what I'm talking about,

24
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,024
you only need four people in this group,

25
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,090
and you don't have as
many pieces of paper.

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,134
Don't take more without asking,

27
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:03,933
why are you taking more?

28
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,033
Why?

29
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,784
- Because Tyler got [Inaudible] on it.

30
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,013
- Go wash it in the sink.

31
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:12,915
I'll mark down on my clipboard

32
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:15,353
who's having trouble with self-control.

33
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:18,233
Go to the sink and wash
it with soap and water.

34
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,462
All right, so you guys do not have

35
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:21,808
the same number of papers

36
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:23,132
that they have at the other table,

37
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:24,386
because you only have four people,

38
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,779
so I'm gonna let you add more.

39
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:27,543
If you feel that you could
add a few more pieces

40
00:01:27,543 --> 00:01:29,656
to fill it out more, go for it.

41
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,489
And then I'll check in with
y'all in just a minute.

42
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,271
- Add head.

43
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,753
- Yeah, but she said it
has to be a word.

44
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:41,795
What's another word for stomach acid?

45
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,350
- Stomach acid?

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,115
- Acid?

47
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:47,089
- Why don't you put acid?

48
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,062
- That could be anything.

49
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:50,595
- In your stomach?

50
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:51,663
- Stomach acid's

51
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:53,636
kinda like a compound word.

52
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:55,053
- Well, actually, since
stomach's already here,

53
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:57,259
and if we put acid right here,

54
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,488
you can't just say it's
any kind of acid.

55
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,531
- Yeah, because it's going
down the mouth,

56
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,201
to the throat, to the...

57
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:06,778
and they have acid in the stomach.

58
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:12,212
- Well, that's the intestine.

59
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:15,411
Duh, acid.

60
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:31,444
[bell rings]

61
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:32,907
- I'm gonna stop you right now,

62
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:35,554
because we wanna take
this to another level,

63
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:39,431
but what I have is I have several

64
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:41,683
groups with several different
ways of looking at it.

65
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:44,586
What seems to be a common thread

66
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:46,583
among some of you is to order things,

67
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,208
to put them in an order of sequence.

68
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,556
I had one group that grouped them.

69
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,270
So, what I'm asking is that,

70
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,286
I'm still seeing a little
bit of food in there,

71
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,189
and I'm still seeing that
you've got processes,

72
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:02,464
some people have processes in there,

73
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,576
and body parts, we got lots of body parts.

74
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:09,513
So, what I'm gonna ask you
to do is, if we could put,

75
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,812
if we could create a
big system on the board,

76
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:15,227
with the pieces, and if
there are duplicates,

77
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,899
this is why I didn't want
you sticking 'em too much,

78
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,756
we just put it on top.

79
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:20,915
So I'm gonna ask you to do this,

80
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:24,096
this is gonna be tricky, we're
not gonna have a lot of time,

81
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:26,836
so I'm gonna ask you to bring, by groups,

82
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:28,671
your Post-Its and put them on the board,

83
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,226
this is our work space.

84
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,177
So if you think it should be in,

85
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:34,382
out five groups, four of you think it

86
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,122
should be in a linear kind of grouping,

87
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:40,280
so we're gonna go with the
sequence of events order.

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,670
So what I want you to do
is put 'em on the board

89
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,063
and let's look at what you've got,

90
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:47,478
if there's duplicates, put it on top,

91
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,150
if there's something you
have that's different,

92
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,123
figure out where, if
you can move something,

93
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:52,818
can it share a space,

94
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,258
does it happen at the same time?

95
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:56,232
We talked about it over there,

96
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,019
what three things did you have?

97
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,597
- Esophagus, throat and neck.

98
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:03,290
- So they thought those
were on equal grounds.

99
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,960
That they were all,
either in the same place,

100
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,725
or the same function, I wasn't sure,

101
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:10,580
I didn't ask them, but
they've got them together.

102
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,159
So, this is gonna be hard.

103
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,157
It's real easy sitting there with

104
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:15,154
your group of five or six or four people.

105
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,784
Now you've gotta work with
twenty-four, twenty-three.

106
00:04:19,136 --> 00:04:20,044
Okay?

107
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:24,570
So, we're gonna start with Group One.

108
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,428
And if you can just come
stick 'em on the board,

109
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:30,423
and I'm gonna get Group Four next.

110
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,257
And you'll go up with them.

111
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,576
So, you have to make one
picture on this board

112
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,457
that shows me how
you think they fit.

113
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:40,082
If you wanna put them
in the same order,

114
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,684
don't make them touch,

115
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:43,863
leave enough room for manipulations.

116
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:44,554
Yes?

117
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,082
- [Inaudible]

118
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,220
- No.

119
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,076
Pardon?

120
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,144
- [Inaudible]

121
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:56,144
- The abdomen is the middle,
the butt is the fleshy part.

122
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,053
The anus is the actual opening,

123
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,887
and the rectum is the tube.

124
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:04,481
Yeah, so it's very distinct differences.

125
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,360
They can't interchange.

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,870
All right, so just stick 'em on,

127
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,216
and then move quickly.

128
00:05:10,216 --> 00:05:11,517
Got 'em?

129
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:20,833
All right, got 'em on?

130
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:21,994
That's why I said, they're not going

131
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:23,434
to stick well, if you keep sticking them

132
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,733
on your face and get
the oil from your face.

133
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:28,877
All right?

134
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,188
Make sure you agree.

135
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:35,931
Now, you're gonna go up there
with your Post-It notes.

136
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:39,721
You may need to use some of their pieces,

137
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:41,996
you're welcome to move
any of their pieces,

138
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:45,897
to fit in, since you're
coming up there after them.

139
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:47,267
And the group that comes after you

140
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:50,164
will be free to move
any of your pieces, okay?

141
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:53,513
All right, y'all pay attention.

142
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:55,208
All right.

143
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,368
Got 'em?

144
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,175
All right, can you do me a favor and

145
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:03,033
plan before you get up here
how you're gonna do it,

146
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,263
so we can make it move quickly.

147
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,842
All right, guys, have a seat.

148
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,348
Now, they don't, they have
some words you don't have.

149
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:11,159
So how are you gonna make this work?

150
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,120
You gonna put yours up above it?

151
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,212
- We're gonna put ours in our order,

152
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:17,600
we could fit their's in there.

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,504
- There you go,
however you wanna do it.

154
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:25,327
Come up and get their voices.

155
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,094
- What's next, mouth?

156
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:31,626
Water, where's water?

157
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:38,433
- I think we need mouth.

158
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,710
- I have teeth.

159
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,789
- Tongue, then teeth.

160
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:41,789
- Mouth.

161
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:42,997
- I have taste-buds.

162
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:46,167
It was tongue, teeth, then chewing.

163
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:49,760
- It was tongue, then teeth.

164
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,086
- Saliva, it was saliva, saliva.

165
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:54,559
- Chewing.

166
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:57,397
I think it was tongue, then saliva.

167
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:01,308
No, It was tongue,
taste-buds, saliva, teeth.

168
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:02,469
- Then chew.

169
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,342
And then I think it was esophagus, next.

170
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,268
- I have intestine, stomach and waste.

171
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:14,005
- Stomach and then
intestines and then waste.

172
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:21,446
- And then kidney, no put 'em on the same.

173
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:30,206
All right, we put theirs
up, now teeth, intestines...

174
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,288
- I'm gonna leave
you guys for last over there,

175
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:33,932
you have a smaller group,
I'm gonna leave you for last.

176
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:35,232
All right?

177
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:47,018
[Background Chatter]

178
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,394
- All right, so health?

179
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,995
Health should be overall,
I guess it's like, yeah.

180
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:55,897
- Yeah, you get health from eating.

181
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:00,815
- Proteins go with food, no?

182
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,114
- Yeah, nutrients.

183
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:08,570
- How are you doing?

184
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,262
- It's kind of hard to put
this in the same group with...

185
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:15,164
- So, you were looking linear,

186
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,673
and now it's hard to go linear,

187
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,159
because they've thrown
these other things in.

188
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:21,851
Yeah, you have a scrap
board, what do you do?

189
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,870
You might wanna build off.

190
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,379
- That's what I'm saying, or like,

191
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,469
switching some, some
of them are very vague.

192
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,210
- And that's exactly it.

193
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,253
If they're vague, you're not quite sure

194
00:08:32,253 --> 00:08:34,575
how they tie in, you weren't
there for their discussion.

195
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,642
So you don't know what
their train of thought was.

196
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:37,849
So make it work.

197
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,869
And realize that somebody's
gonna come behind you,

198
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:41,100
and they might change it.

199
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,423
- Let's put protein and nutrients.

200
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:47,005
But health is overall.

201
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,007
- All right, this is
getting very interesting.

202
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:51,344
Their strategy...

203
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,429
- You have to realize,
and I'll make the point

204
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,989
while we're waiting for them to finish,

205
00:08:54,989 --> 00:08:56,988
because they're having
their own discussions.

206
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:58,613
When you have your
discussion with your group,

207
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,680
your having a discussion
with a small group.

208
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,954
So, when you get up
there and you see a word,

209
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,626
and you weren't there for the discussion

210
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,506
that brought that word into the list,

211
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,644
you weren't there, you don't know

212
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,014
what their thinking was.

213
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:13,358
So, just like we always say, you can't

214
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,865
disregard somebody's input because you

215
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:18,234
don't believe it should be there.

216
00:09:19,774 --> 00:09:21,107
You have to find a way,

217
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:22,343
oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

218
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:23,992
Thank you, I need you next,

219
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:25,989
because y'all have the next least amount.

220
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,451
Thank you for catching that.

221
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:31,259
You have to make sure that what you do

222
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,858
doesn't lose the meaning
or change the meaning

223
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,575
and doesn't judge somebody else's input,

224
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,270
you have to just make it work.

225
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,988
Grab it.

226
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:45,678
If you know where it goes.

227
00:09:47,438 --> 00:09:49,068
All right, but if, by some chance,

228
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:50,601
that's what happens
when you start stacking,

229
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:53,596
we can use this masking
tape in little tiny pieces.

230
00:09:53,596 --> 00:09:55,147
All right, go for it.

231
00:09:55,147 --> 00:09:56,959
- Ooh!

232
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,816
- Are you all right, is it
still working? You're fine!

233
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,348
- Yes, we're okay.

234
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:02,995
- You lost a nose, we dropped a nose.

235
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:04,342
- A nose!

236
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,217
- But you see, it's OK,

237
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:12,910
it may not have stood
out in your discussion.

238
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,139
And you might have brought something

239
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,018
to the discussion that they didn't.

240
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,386
- Y'all gotta talk louder.

241
00:10:22,386 --> 00:10:24,615
- Okay, nose should be here.

242
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:26,473
- Literally, put it right on top of it.

243
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:30,165
- Stomach, okay, teeth, chewing,

244
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:34,285
epiglottis, esophagus, wait, esophagus,

245
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,725
esophagus, wait.

246
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:37,796
- If you have to move something,

247
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:39,343
or if you think it needs to be...

248
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:41,081
- This is the esophagus.

249
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:42,497
- In other words,

250
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:43,751
if you think you have to move something

251
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,237
over to fit yours in,
because it's not there...

252
00:10:45,237 --> 00:10:46,793
- And then...

253
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,302
- Intestines.

254
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,159
- And then acid.

255
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,831
- This word's already here.

256
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:56,359
So right after the mouth?

257
00:10:56,359 --> 00:11:01,322
- Then intestines,
and then to the kidneys,

258
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,618
and then to the waste, and then health.

259
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,897
- Do you wanna move it somewhere else?

260
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:11,382
If you think something
should be on the same plain,

261
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,912
I just use the example of
Scrabble game with them.

262
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:15,166
- I think saliva...

263
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,722
- I think water and food.

264
00:11:16,722 --> 00:11:18,603
- Once you put it into your mouth,

265
00:11:18,603 --> 00:11:19,926
you're gonna get saliva.

266
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:22,016
- Okay, so, see what they did?

267
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,502
So if you feel like you
need to move anything,

268
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:25,290
we need to get saliva back in there,

269
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,776
so how's saliva gonna work?

270
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:29,725
- Saliva goes with taste-buds and mouth.

271
00:11:29,725 --> 00:11:31,280
And tongue!

272
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:37,121
- Put it, like, in the middle.

273
00:11:37,121 --> 00:11:38,909
- Okay, it should stick.

274
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:41,857
Wait, discuss, go ahead,
tell them what you think.

275
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,507
- It looks like...

276
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:47,975
- Are y'all ready, are you almost ready?

277
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:48,950
- No.

278
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,274
- You do know, the more that get up there,

279
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,365
the harder it gets.

280
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,549
- So you're making it harder for us?

281
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:54,105
- No, I'm making it harder for them.

282
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,173
- Oh!

283
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,143
- All right, I'm coming.

284
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:00,281
Got it?

285
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:03,114
- They have like three on intestines.

286
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,436
- Let's put a little piece of tape

287
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:07,642
to hold up the intestines.

288
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:09,708
Yeah, just stick a little
piece up at the top.

289
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,171
It doesn't matter.

290
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:14,236
And can you add this to the
waste so it doesn't fall?

291
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:16,357
All right, you guys, good?

292
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,284
Okay, go!

293
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,187
All right, how are y'all doing out there?

294
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,091
Are you watching this unfold?

295
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:27,043
- Yeah.

296
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:29,621
- And Group One, I mean
Three, Group Three?

297
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,119
You guys look at the task ahead of you,

298
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,837
it's gotten bigger.

299
00:12:37,717 --> 00:12:39,203
- I need tape.

300
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:41,873
- All right, I'm gonna give
you a little bit.

301
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:44,311
I'd like you not to put
too much on the board,

302
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:45,843
more on the paper.

303
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:47,770
You have to figure out,
if you have a duplicate,

304
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,976
then just tape it over the top of it.

305
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,087
Anything that's duplicate.

306
00:12:54,677 --> 00:12:56,176
All right, all right.

307
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:01,288
- I need tape.

308
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,220
- You need tape, all right, so,

309
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,078
- Where do you put stomach?

310
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:06,165
- All right, so he's got a question about

311
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:06,973
where to put stomach.

312
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,506
- No, I have stomach acid,

313
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,201
I'm seeing where she's putting stomach.

314
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:13,080
- It's over here, this is acid.

315
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,957
- All right, so it's way down there.

316
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:14,793
So move down there.

317
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:15,768
- I need some tape.

318
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:16,743
- And I will tell you the same thing

319
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:17,858
I told the other two groups.

320
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:19,321
Think about Scrabble.

321
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:23,036
So if you have to go in
a different direction

322
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,497
to make something work, you just go

323
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,308
in a different direction,
you make it work.

324
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:30,443
Okay, you guys have the hardest job.

325
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:32,811
Or it might be the easiest.

326
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:33,856
- Mucus!

327
00:13:35,836 --> 00:13:38,297
- Where does the gallbladder go?

328
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,556
- What is that, epiligotis, oh, my bad.

329
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,743
- But, look how much came out.

330
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:45,019
That's good, we didn't
have that much expansion

331
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:47,666
on that idea before, all
we had was body parts.

332
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:00,337
- Can we have tape for two?

333
00:14:00,337 --> 00:14:01,730
- What do you need?

334
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,682
- Two pieces of tape.

335
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,493
- All right, two pieces of tape.

336
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:06,884
All right, how we doing?

337
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,322
- Emily, where do I put mucus?

338
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,155
- Mucus goes with the, in between...

339
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,722
- The neck thing?

340
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,040
- Is that everything?

341
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,572
- All right, y'all ready?

342
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,214
[Background Chatter]

343
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:42,965
Would you do me a favor and

344
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,799
tell Mr. Dresser we
need five more minutes?

345
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:47,748
You have a test?

346
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:49,373
Oh, tell him three minutes.

347
00:14:49,373 --> 00:14:50,784
[laughing]

348
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,452
Thank you.

349
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,634
So we need three minutes.

350
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,164
You got it?

351
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:02,882
- Okay, I think it's good.

352
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:04,486
- All right, ready guys?

353
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,464
All right, have a seat.

354
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,252
Okay, now, everybody goes up, last group.

355
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:10,342
Take your papers, go!

356
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,289
- I need a band-aid.

357
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,613
- For what?

358
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,586
- To put over my...

359
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,351
- Your what?

360
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,131
Let me look and see if I have one.

361
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,689
Sometimes you have
those little bitty ones.

362
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,147
Okay, I will look.

363
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,029
If you need them...

364
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,366
Thank you.

365
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:39,575
All right, if you're stacking
it and it won't stick,

366
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,433
I have tape.

367
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:50,826
Here, stick your mouth on that mouth.

368
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,194
- This we can put over
this, can we change this?

369
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,652
- Yes.

370
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,657
Use this, all right, you got it?

371
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,851
Here, just put it like that.

372
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,290
All right, how are y'all doing?

373
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,078
What do you have left?

374
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:28,005
Why don't you, Alex, would you

375
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:30,490
lift up health and move my volcanoes,

376
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,998
just slide the volcano
down, it'll come off.

377
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:35,087
Just slide it down.

378
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,055
Now you can do it that way.

379
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,006
Do you need more tape?

380
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:46,212
All right, how are we doing?

381
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:52,185
In case it doesn't stick.

382
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,740
Got it?

383
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,689
All right, now, I want you to,

384
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,106
while you are waiting,

385
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,567
and I appreciate the patience
that you guys have had,

386
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,794
I want you to watch and look
at what it looks like now.

387
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:07,068
Because some of you made
some significant placements

388
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,762
and they've made some
significant changes to that.

389
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,825
So take a look at what the
resulting image is here.

390
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,566
Y'all finished?

391
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,842
- Wait, don't you think
this should be over there?

392
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:24,459
- That's right, they get to,

393
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,433
you have your perspective

394
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,197
and they're bringing theirs to it.

395
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,287
And they had, what could
have been the hardest part,

396
00:17:30,287 --> 00:17:31,657
or the easiest part.

397
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:34,722
Okay, I wanna pick up on one thing

398
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,579
that you guys said,
because one of the things

399
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:38,855
that you had, when you came here,

400
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,200
and the group was already,
had already laid all this out,

401
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,756
was that they felt strongly that

402
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,381
the mouth needed to be here.

403
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:46,117
So why?

404
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:47,743
- Because food goes in there.

405
00:17:47,743 --> 00:17:49,485
- [Loudspeaker] Paging Mrs.
Dalton, Dalton come in.

406
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,739
- I'm sorry, hold on.

407
00:17:50,739 --> 00:17:52,294
Try it again.

408
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:53,479
- Like if you're eating something like

409
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:54,756
a hamburger or you're drinking water,

410
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:57,263
it's gonna go straight to your mouth,

411
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:59,260
and then, it goes in there.

412
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,187
- So in the order that
we've established here,

413
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:03,323
do you see what they did?

414
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:04,693
Do you agree with that?

415
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:05,390
- Yeah.

416
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,365
- Is it logical?

417
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:07,201
- Yeah.

418
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:09,820
- OK, is there anything
else that you placed,

419
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,258
that you recognize was changed?

420
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,627
And you wanna know why it was changed.

421
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,811
Or you went, "Oh!"

422
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,902
Because I did hear a lot of,

423
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:18,086
"Oh, we didn't think of that,"

424
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,246
when you were watching
these things go up.

425
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:24,286
- Like at first, I thought that
that should go before that.

426
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,981
- Don't know "that,"
I don't know what "that" is.

427
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,954
- Um, the glucose, water, and food.

428
00:18:27,954 --> 00:18:29,417
- Okay, this column of...

429
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:32,993
- Yes, I thought that that
should go before the mouth,

430
00:18:32,993 --> 00:18:34,909
because, I was like,
"But don't you put it in,

431
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,999
"don't you put the food in your mouth?"

432
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,553
And they were like, "Yeah,
but once it enters your body,

433
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:41,132
"it's not first in the..."

434
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:43,779
- Okay, using that logic,
is there anything else

435
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:45,381
that should be adjusted?

436
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:46,588
Blair?

437
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,399
- Uh, where the nose is?

438
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:50,628
- Okay, what do you
think we should do with that?

439
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:52,486
- You should put the nose
right before the mouth,

440
00:18:52,486 --> 00:18:55,829
or after, because it's
like, you kinda smelled it

441
00:18:55,829 --> 00:18:57,617
before you put it in your mouth.

442
00:18:57,617 --> 00:19:00,102
- So would this be logical
if I moved this over

443
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,866
and put this here, like he suggested.

444
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:02,795
- Yes.

445
00:19:04,235 --> 00:19:05,744
- I want to disagree.

446
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,939
- You disagree, you're welcome to.

447
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,631
- Smelling it, is not a part
of digesting it, at all.

448
00:19:11,631 --> 00:19:13,349
- Yeah, that's what I said.

449
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:16,577
- Is growling a part of digesting it?

450
00:19:16,577 --> 00:19:17,738
- No.

451
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:20,454
- It's the way your body
reacts to the smell.

452
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:22,451
- If we use your logic,
I'm not saying, remember,

453
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:25,622
the way we work things in here is that

454
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,443
you can't judge if it's right or wrong,

455
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:30,341
you can certainly disagree
with it, that's true.

456
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:32,807
I may disagree, but this is your work,

457
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,547
this is not for me to, this
is what you're thinking.

458
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,381
So, but, using the logic you used,

459
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,887
growling, light-headed
and dryness in mouth

460
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,557
is not a part of digestion, but what

461
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,181
do these things have in common?

462
00:19:46,181 --> 00:19:48,782
I saw someone, what do these things

463
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,128
here have in common?

464
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:51,707
- They're symptoms of hunger.

465
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:54,447
- OK, so you're calling
them symptoms of hunger?

466
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,978
What else might they be?

467
00:19:56,978 --> 00:19:58,557
- Indicators?

468
00:19:58,557 --> 00:19:59,787
- Indicators?

469
00:19:59,787 --> 00:20:01,482
Is there another word?

470
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:03,131
- Signals.

471
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:05,174
- Signals.  If you have stomach growling,

472
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:07,473
you feel light-headed, you
have a dryness in your mouth,

473
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,865
that's a signal, right?

474
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:13,022
And where does the nose fit in to that?

475
00:20:13,022 --> 00:20:14,624
And I'll come back to you.

476
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:16,273
You have an answer for my
question with the nose?

477
00:20:16,273 --> 00:20:17,968
Or you have something else to add?

478
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:21,846
- Like the nose, the nose indicates

479
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,773
that you're allowed to
put food in your mouth

480
00:20:23,773 --> 00:20:27,116
and so you prepare with the saliva

481
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,742
so you can help break it down.

482
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:32,944
- So the nose, so if you can't smell...

483
00:20:32,944 --> 00:20:35,405
- It's like, when you have a cold,

484
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:36,984
you can't really taste things.

485
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:39,631
- Okay, but does the saliva not flow?

486
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,232
Because you can't smell?

487
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:43,230
Because you said, you need to smell

488
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,925
to be able to get the
saliva to break it down.

489
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:46,968
So if you can't smell, if
you have a stuffy nose,

490
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:48,431
or if you don't have
a sense of smell,

491
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:50,823
does that stop the saliva?

492
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:52,100
- No.

493
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,883
- No, she said, "I don't know."

494
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:58,160
And that's an okay answer.

495
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,321
She doesn't know.

496
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:00,964
You could have an opinion.
