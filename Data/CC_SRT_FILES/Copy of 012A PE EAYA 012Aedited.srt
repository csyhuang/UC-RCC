1
00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:01,486
- To learn today.

2
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:03,761
We're going to begin a unit on indoor

3
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:08,196
ultimate frisbee, and
we've got the indoor, soft

4
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:11,238
styrofoam frisbee, all right?

5
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:13,281
One thing about the frisbee
I want you to understand,

6
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:15,208
number one, it's styrofoam.

7
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,136
That means you can easily break them.

8
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,574
All right, please don't bend
them like I'm doing here

9
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:21,245
any more than I just did.

10
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,706
Obviously, tugging on them, pulling them,

11
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:26,168
poking them is going to harm the frisbee.

12
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:27,909
You want it to be intact,

13
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:30,695
so just use the frisbee
as it's meant to be used,

14
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:34,039
and don't play with it
in any other way, okay?

15
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,104
So that way we keep the
frisbee in good shape.

16
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:39,728
Now, here is the question
we want to answer:

17
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:42,003
why do frisbees fly?

18
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,904
A lot of different reasons,
and a lot of these reasons

19
00:00:45,904 --> 00:00:48,597
have to do with the concept of flight.

20
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:52,312
All right, like an
airplane, like a helicopter,

21
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:55,331
or a paper airplane, okay?

22
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:57,862
Now, frisbee flight's a little different

23
00:00:57,862 --> 00:00:59,533
than some other types of flight.

24
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,504
Firstly we're going to look
at this: angular momentum,

25
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:07,799
big word, but the concept
of angular momentum

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,793
essentially means that frisbees fly,

27
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:15,137
one of the reasons why
frisbees fly and maintain

28
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:18,852
stability in flight is because they spin.

29
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:21,986
So, the fact that the frisbees spin

30
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,169
is called angular momentum.

31
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,862
All right, and again, that's what produces

32
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:28,766
stability in the air.

33
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,111
You find angular momentum
in a lot of things.

34
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:33,038
You guys ever use a top, a spinning top?

35
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,362
- [Class member] Yes, at home.

36
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:37,450
- That's an act of a football as a top.

37
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:42,512
If I just balance this
football, it'll fall, right?

38
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:44,532
It doesn't remain upright.

39
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:47,039
But, when I spin the football like a top,

40
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,104
it maintains its upright position.

41
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,264
That is angular momentum.

42
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:55,305
That is why it does not fall down.

43
00:01:55,305 --> 00:02:00,228
The force of friction will eventually

44
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:02,573
slow down the football,
and that's why it will

45
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:06,311
topple over and fall,
but while it's spinning,

46
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,842
angular momentum is what keeps it up.

47
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:10,607
When a frisbee spins,
the reason why it doesn't

48
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:12,627
wobble in flight and fall from the air

49
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:15,952
is because it's supposed to
spin, as you can see there,

50
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,810
and that's what keeps it stable.

51
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,271
That's also what helps us
to throw it accurately.

52
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:25,193
Another concept is angular lift.

53
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:28,908
Angular lift, like an airplane.

54
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:32,136
There's different pressures
above and below the wing.

55
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:34,341
These concepts are really complicated

56
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,640
if you look into them in detail,

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,053
but the basic gist of this concept is that

58
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:42,834
there's a low pressure on top,

59
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:44,279
and a high pressure on the bottom,

60
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:45,974
and when I throw the airplane,

61
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:48,993
that pressure difference
is what gives it lift

62
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:50,525
and allows it to fly, okay?

63
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:53,381
Now, one thing I'm going to do
before I throw this airplane

64
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,423
is I'm going to use force.

65
00:02:56,423 --> 00:02:59,186
Force production, I produce
force behind the plane

66
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:01,043
and that allows it to fly.

67
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,226
In the same way, I will produce
force behind the frisbee,

68
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,316
and that will allow it to fly.

69
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:08,404
The other end is force absorption,

70
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,192
which we'll talk about in just a minute.

71
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:13,628
So again, aerodynamic lift is when

72
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,739
the pressure differences
allow this airplane to lift,

73
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,015
and I'm going to produce
force for that to happen.

74
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,988
- [Class member] Can I go get it?

75
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:23,549
- No, we'll leave that there, all right?

76
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:25,911
Now, I need one person to demonstrate

77
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,792
how to throw the frisbee properly.

78
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:28,697
Julia, please.

79
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:30,699
(class members not chosen complain)

80
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:33,067
I'll have you stand here, now watch.

81
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,876
You're going to, listen,
I'm going to go over this

82
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:38,872
one time with you, and
then you're going to

83
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:41,658
use these checklists on the cones

84
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:44,816
to teach one another
how to do it properly.

85
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,393
Now, I know a lot of you, listen, please.

86
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,994
I know a lot of you would
like when you do the frisbee,

87
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,641
you can throw the frisbee,
but there's one...

88
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:55,868
The difference between really
just throwing the frisbee

89
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,352
and understanding how
to throw the frisbee.

90
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:02,300
Understanding the
mechanics behind it, okay?

91
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,131
So, the mechanics behind
throwing a frisbee

92
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,413
are just this:

93
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,146
the mechanics behind a frisbee are this:

94
00:04:11,146 --> 00:04:13,770
number one, I need to know my target.

95
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,109
Two, when throwing a frisbee,
you step with the same foot.

96
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,454
Not the opposite foot, like
when you throw a baseball,

97
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:24,590
but rather, I step with the same foot.

98
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,121
I'm going to point my elbow at my target,

99
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:29,512
I'm going to curl my wrist and bring the

100
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,323
frisbee across my chest.

101
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:32,670
Girls, I need you to pay attention.

102
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,214
If you miss this instruction it's going to

103
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:36,188
be more complicated later.

104
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,881
So, I'm going to step towards my target,

105
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,482
frisbee curled up to my chest,

106
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,943
and then point my elbow at my target.

107
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:46,056
Now, when I extend my elbow,

108
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:48,633
I'm going to snap my wrist.

109
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:51,907
That's going to create
the spin that gives this

110
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:54,438
one, two, three...

111
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:55,808
- [Class] Angular momentum.

112
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,155
- Angular momentum.

113
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,780
And that's what's going
to give it stability.

114
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,427
So, I'm going to step, point the elbow,

115
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,190
snap the wrist, point to my target,

116
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,812
produce force, and on the other end,

117
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:10,157
what Julia's going to do, once I throw it,

118
00:05:10,157 --> 00:05:13,129
is she's going to use force absorption.

119
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:14,708
She's going to catch it.

120
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,310
Fundamentals of catching.

121
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,052
Julia, what I'd like you to do is,

122
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:20,095
square yourself with the frisbee.

123
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:23,067
If the frisbee moves to your right,

124
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,157
I want you to move to your right, okay?

125
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:27,664
If it moves to your left, I
want you to move to your left.

126
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:30,474
Because you want to meet it,
and square your body to it.

127
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,865
And last, I want you to put
your hands in this position,

128
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,700
palms together and fingers out.

129
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,557
All right, they don't have to be touching,

130
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:40,319
but we're going to try
to pancake the frisbee.

131
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,732
All right, hopefully my throw goes well.

132
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,148
Here we go.

133
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:50,094
Step, elbow, oh, wrist snap, release.

134
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:51,859
One more thing I forgot to mention,

135
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,807
release it level with the ground.

136
00:05:54,807 --> 00:05:56,665
If I release it at an angle
here, it's going to go

137
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:59,521
up or down this way, if I
release it at an angle here,

138
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,100
it's going to go up or down this way.

139
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,145
So, release it level, one
more thing to remember.

140
00:06:04,145 --> 00:06:05,715
Ready?

141
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:08,269
Step, nice try.

142
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,894
Don't laugh, don't laugh.

143
00:06:09,894 --> 00:06:11,125
All right, I want you
to try the same thing.

144
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,704
I want you to step with the same foot,

145
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,001
point your elbow in, and when you throw,

146
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,323
throw it, point your finger at me,

147
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:19,959
remember to release it level.

148
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,499
You're ready, go.

149
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,692
Yes!

150
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:27,060
It's all right, you can
grab it with one hand,

151
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,244
there's no problem with that.

152
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:30,171
That frisbee had good
spin on it, all right.

153
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:32,772
She released it, did she release it level?

154
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,584
- [Class member] No.

155
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,187
- No, that's why it bounced off the wall.

156
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,996
One more time, step, elbow, wrist snap,

157
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:41,015
point, release level.

158
00:06:41,015 --> 00:06:42,431
Good catch.

159
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,265
- [Class member] Nice one, dude!

160
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:47,098
- Here you go, you got it.

161
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,282
Perfect.

162
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,650
Now, I could have moved
to the side a little bit

163
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,321
to catch that frisbee,
but I did a little reach,

164
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:54,667
and that's okay, too.

165
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,525
All right, so with your
groups of four, remember,

166
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,127
wait, wait, wait!

167
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,797
You're going to coach your
partner in throwing and catching,

168
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:03,073
use the checklist on the cones.

169
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:05,952
Ready, set, grab one frisbee, go.

170
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:09,783
(class shuffles around)

171
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:31,942
(background chatter)

172
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,713
- Can I stand here?

173
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:36,199
- You and you, here.

174
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,448
You're going to be here.

175
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,471
You guys are all working together,

176
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:46,856
you're going to hold this.

177
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:48,899
Wait, wait, wait!

178
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,036
There should be two on each cone,

179
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,125
one person holding the cone.

180
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:59,473
Stop, where's your partner?

181
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,696
You're going to coach her throwing.

182
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,614
You're going to go first, and I want you

183
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,406
to catch it, and then throw it to her,

184
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:07,939
and you're going to be catching,

185
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,284
and every couple tries,
we're going to switch.

186
00:08:10,284 --> 00:08:12,885
Okay, pick up your cone and coach.

187
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,764
Pick up your cone...

188
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:35,224
(background chatter)

189
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,941
You're the instructor,
he's going to catch, right?

190
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:41,145
All right.

191
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:45,859
You're the instructor,
you should watch her.

192
00:08:45,859 --> 00:09:45,549
(background chatter)

193
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:49,293
- One, two, three, frisbee!

194
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:53,751
- Make sure you're reading and helping!

195
00:09:53,751 --> 00:10:47,340
(background chatter)

196
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,523
All right, practice a couple times,

197
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:54,144
and, three, stop!

198
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:59,879
Stop, stop, stop.

199
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:02,108
Now, with the catch,

200
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:06,543
with the force absorption, okay?

201
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,607
You're absorbing that throw, listen.

202
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:12,788
I know that the throws aren't
all going to be accurate,

203
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:15,389
that's all the more reason
why you have to move

204
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:19,383
to where you think the
frisbee's going to land,

205
00:11:19,383 --> 00:11:23,191
and meet the oncoming frisbee, okay?

206
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:27,045
So, with your partner's
help, coach's help,

207
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,994
keep practicing, and we're going to switch

208
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:32,014
in just a minute.

209
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:35,329
Make sure you correct
any improper technique.
