1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,558
- Well, we all thought
that a diamond might be

2
00:00:02,558 --> 00:00:03,761
a pure substance.

3
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:04,759
- [Teacher] Why?

4
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,753
- Well, I think a diamond
can only be cut by itself,

5
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:11,261
and can only be cut with
a different diamond.

6
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,004
- [Teacher] OK.

7
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,127
- So that's really dense, so we thought

8
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,767
that if anything was added to it,

9
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:17,385
something else would be able to cut it.

10
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:19,638
And that would be something
else that was less dense.

11
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:20,497
- So, interesting.

12
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:21,704
What is, um ...

13
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,194
You're talking about density.

14
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,886
What is density?

15
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,517
- It's a characteristic property.

16
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:28,606
- A characteristic property.

17
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:29,975
So this is good.

18
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:32,878
You definitely should be
starting to lean towards

19
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:36,482
what you know about characteristic
properties of matter.

20
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:37,313
Okay?

21
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:40,796
That is key to helping you
understand the difference

22
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:42,607
between pure and mixture.

23
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:43,884
Who can tell me what a characteristic

24
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,666
property of matter is?

25
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,149
Hannah?

26
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,191
- A property that stays
the same regardless of

27
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:54,184
the amount of the substance.

28
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:56,970
- Yeah, a property that stays
the same for a substance

29
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,456
regardless of the amount.

30
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,863
So what I'm hearing you
say, is that you think

31
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,169
the ability to cut into a diamond

32
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:05,329
has to do with its density.

33
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:08,835
And you're saying that because
you can only cut a diamond

34
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,876
with a diamond, it must mean that

35
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:14,101
the densities are the same.

36
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,190
And so, since the density is the same

37
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,993
for the whole diamond,

38
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:23,104
that means it's one substance.
