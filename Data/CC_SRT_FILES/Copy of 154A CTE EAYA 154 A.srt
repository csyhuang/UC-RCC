1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,540
- [Instructor] That's what we're going to
do today, is you all are going to learn

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,080
how to draw blood. You're going to learn
how to actually stick the fake arms that

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,080
we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is
actually what they're called. And each one

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,550
of you have gotten to a certain point in
either phlebotomy or medical assisting

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,350
where you're ready to start drawing blood.
And I know that Wanda has gotten a little

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:30,140
further but it never hurts to refresh on
the procedures because, guys, when you get

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,200
out there in the clinical area, a lot of
people don't follow a lot of the steps

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,030
that you need to do as far as blood draws.
Guys that are medical assisting, you are

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,010
not going to have to do as many
venipunctures and the phlebotomy students

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,990
but you may be responsible for drawing
blood in a doctor's office. When you're

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:55,040
there in the doctor's office it's just you
and the person. So you quickly develop

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,190
really good phlebotomy skills because if
you don't get it then you have to send

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,400
them to outpatient hospital to be able to
get that blood drawn. The first things I

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:14,540
want to talk about is your vein choice.
And I printed off your veins. And the

15
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,220
median cubital is your vein of choice and
the median cubital runs

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,490
right here in the middle.

17
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:22,800
- [Female] You can see this one better.

18
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:26,490
- Yeah, you see that one better. Your
median cubital runs right in the middle

19
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,320
and then your basilic is the one you want
to stay away from. That's the one that

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:39,690
runs little finger side. And then your
cephalic is on the thumb side. So this

21
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,380
little finger side toward the inside of
the elbow is the one you really want to

22
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,850
stay away from. And the reason that this
is your last choice vein is there's quite

23
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,880
a few nerves that are right underneath it.
So if you go too deep or you move the

24
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,300
needle around too much you can actually
cause nerve damage. And I will leave this

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,650
on the table as y'all are practicing
with your phlebotomy arms so that you can

26
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:10,960
look at your vein choice. Nerve damage is
a very real possibility and some nerve

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,030
damage is permanent so be very careful
when you're choosing your vein. You can

28
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,090
only advance or withdraw the needle only.
You cannot go sideways. I know those of

29
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,870
you who's already been in the clinical site,
you've seen them go sideways, you've seen

30
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,180
them come out and go back in. And guys,
that could be a liability for you, and

31
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,390
you're the only one that can protect your
patient and you. I've got the materials

32
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:45,030
set up. Whenever we repeat this, you all
will set your materials up so take notice

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,840
of what we've got here because you'll need
this every time you practice on the

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,470
phlebotomy arms. When you go to clean your
arm, you're going to clean in a circular

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,010
motion. So I'm going to go ahead and get
started. First thing you're going to do, I

36
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,640
don't need your gloves, just the two
hands. First thing you're

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,070
going to do is put on your gloves. I just
washed my hands but I'm going to put on my

38
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,511
gloves. And why do I want to do that? Jim.

39
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:12,871
- [Jim] So I don't get infected.

40
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:20,710
- Yeah, I don't want to come into contact
with someone's blood. Now, who could

41
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,520
protect me from coming into contact with
someone's blood?

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,100
- Yourself.

43
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,700
- I'm the only one that can do that. And I
can tell you, from having my blood drawn,

44
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,920
people have drawn my blood without gloves on
though they didn't know me from Adam. And

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,320
one person in particular got quite a bit
of my blood on them. So I am the only one

46
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,930
that can protect me. If I see you
practicing without your gloves on, it is

47
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:50,600
an automatic grade ding for that practice
day. If I see you drawing in the clinical

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,751
area without gloves on, then we're going
to have a big talk, okay?

49
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,331
Because you've got to protect you.

50
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,171
- [Cathy] I have a question.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,751
With some people that you draw blood on,
do you have to wear a mask?

52
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:08,510
Like an eyeshield-type thing.

53
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,790
- If they are on precautions then yes, you
would. And you've seen, at the hospital,

54
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:21,120
on the doors where they have contact and
respiratory isolation. If you were to go

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,050
into one of those rooms, yes you would. In
the ER, when you draw blood, you usually

56
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,820
have on that splash mask. Now usually,
with a venipuncture, you're not going to

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,310
have that much pressure. It's not going to
shoot the blood back out at you like an

58
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:41,180
arterial would, but still, it's better to
err on the side of safety. But also, if

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,250
there's nothing wrong with me except I
need a CBC to have a surgery and you come

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,200
at me with a mask and a shield, I'm going
to think, "Oh my gosh. Why is she doing

61
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,950
that?" You know? So make sure that it's
appropriate. If you're in a trauma area

62
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,490
then yes, definitely. If you're in an
outpatient clinic, unless that patient

63
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:09,030
tells you, "My veins squirt blood really
bad." A patient will tell you. One time I

64
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,840
was doing a finger stick and it squirted
and I had on my glasses but I turned my

65
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,330
head. It hit me in the hair. So sometimes
the venous flow will do that. Good

66
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,700
question, Cathy. All right, so got my
gloves on, first I'm going to do is I'm

67
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:33,000
going to put the tourniquet on. And guys,
the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,590
first time or two you do it. And you're
going to put it underneath the arm. You

69
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,420
need to make sure it's tight so your vein
will pop up but not so tight you're going

70
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,670
to cut off the blood flow and not so tight
you're going to cause petechiae, which is

71
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,790
little red patches on the arm. I'm going
to cross my hands over. What I do is I put

72
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:57,200
my left hand in position, I take my right
hand, get ahold of the tail of this, pull

73
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,130
it, and then I stick it underneath with my
little finger. You always want your tails

74
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,610
up toward the top so they're not in your
area where you're going to clean and draw.

75
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,261
When I'm going to clean... well, let me
show you how to feel first.

76
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,970
Well, it's not going to cooperate today.

77
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,851
- You can use my arm. That way
they can see better.

78
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:18,731
- Can you move the Sharps container?

79
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:27,500
- I'm going to stick it underneath there.
And now it should stay on there. Now to

80
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,220
locate a vein, I'm going to take my index
finger and I'm going to feel back and

81
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,950
forth. And guys, you all can do this on
each other. Jim's excellent to feel veins

82
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,500
on and he's a real good volunteer. Bounce
back and forth. It feels like a gummy worm

83
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,020
or something soft underneath there. If it
feels really hard, like I have one that

84
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,320
I'll let you all feel that is very
sclerotic or hard, you're not going to get

85
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,400
blood out of it. It's got to be... it's got
to bounce. So when you go across and you

86
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,430
find it, then you're going to find which
way it travels. So you're going to go up

87
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,880
it and down it so you know which way to
put your needle in. Some veins will go off

88
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:13,120
to the side and some remain very straight.
So I found my vein. Now the tourniquet can

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,190
only stay on for one minute. Has my
tourniquet been on about a minute?

90
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,720
Probably so, so I need to take the
tourniquet off, give this patient's arm a

91
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,490
rest, and then I can talk to them about
the weather, I can go ahead and line up my

92
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,120
tubes at that time, and then I'm ready to
draw blood now. So I come in here, I put

93
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,600
my tourniquet on, and guys, when you put
this tourniquet on you got to be ready to

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,830
go because you only have one minute. And
I'm going to clean. I'm going to clean in

95
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:55,720
a circular motion and then, if you're
having trouble with the alcohol, you're

96
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:03,350
not able to fan it, you can't blow on it,
and you can take one very clean 2 by 2,

97
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:12,040
go straight down, dry it off, and
then... many of you already did that. This

98
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,650
part of the needle, this part with the
rubber on it has the needle on it. You

99
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:24,170
screw that in, take the end off, this is a
safety needle. You anchor and then you

100
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,070
stick in the bevel of the needle, that is
the pointy part, the bevel goes up and

101
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:36,340
then the pointy part goes into the skin. I
pull my thumb away as I'm going in. I take

102
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,150
one of these Vacutainer tubes, thank you,
Jim, and I push it in. And guys, when I

103
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:46,260
push in with my thumb I'm pulling back
with my fingers. And you're not able to

104
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,180
see but there is... and I don't do this in
the clinical side, but there is blood

105
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:58,060
coming in there. You let it fill until it
stops. Now it's stopped flowing. I'm going

106
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,980
to wrap my fingers around it and push
because the more still you keep the

107
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,250
needle, the less it's going to hurt the
patient. Pop my tourniquet and I'm going

108
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:14,170
to take a different 2 by 2 than what I
cleaned with. Fold it, lay it on the arm,

109
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,030
and guys, I'm just going to kind of hover
there until I bring the needle out and

110
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:25,750
push down. If I push down while the needle
is in the arm, it hurts really bad. And

111
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,480
I'm going to hold here and I'm going to
hold until it quits bleeding. And you can

112
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,970
peek. Now if the blood... oh, sticky needle
engaged. It's hard to talk and do stuff at

113
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:48,740
the same time, isn't it? Sharps. And you
toss that in the sharps. Now, if this

114
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:54,730
patient is on blood thinners, I've got to
hold longer. A lot of clinics will just

115
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,900
put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there,
put a CoBand on them and send them on

116
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:05,930
their way. If they bleed out outside of
the lab, you're liable. And again, you're

117
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,730
the only one that can protect you. So I
make sure that they've stopped bleeding.

118
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,931
And now how hard is that going to be when
there is a lobby full?

119
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:18,311
You guys have been observing.

120
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:20,751
- Can we ask them to hold it?

121
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:29,690
- Well, you can. But what if they don't
hold it tight enough? What if there's a

122
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,221
whole lobby full? Jim, what have you seen
them do in the past?

123
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,650
- [inaudible] and check.
- Yeah. You need to check it. If there's a

124
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,670
whole lobby full sitting out there then
you'll get to them when you get to them,

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,010
because you've got to protect your
phlebotomy certificate. You're the only

126
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,630
that can do that. A lot of places, they
will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on

127
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,600
there, tell the patient to hold their arm
up. That breaks platelets, that's going to

128
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,030
make a huge bruise, and it doesn't really
help with the clotting that much, just

129
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,380
kind of bruises. So we're going to look
here. Okay, this patient has quit

130
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:17,800
bleeding, so I am good to go here. Now,
another lesson I will teach you about writing

131
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,570
on the vials, the blood draw vials and
what information needs to be on there. So

132
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,461
before you all draw, let me ask you a few
questions. What's your first choice vein?

133
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,200
- Median.

134
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:39,211
- Median. Okay. And why do we avoid the
basilic? Nicole.

135
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,261
- [Nicole] Nerves and tendons.

136
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:47,820
- Nerves. Okay. What can happen if
I... powder on the shirt. What can happen

137
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,661
if I dig around in there and I do injure
somebody? What can they do?

138
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:55,271
- They can bleed or they can have their
nerve damage.

139
00:11:55,271 --> 00:12:01,400
- Right. And they can come and say, "This
phlebotomist drew here." And then, guys,

140
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,510
if you're ever in a setting where you have
to go to court, they're going to call

141
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,920
somebody that's a phlebotomist like you
are and they're going to ask them, "What's

142
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,310
your first choice vein?" And they're going
to say, "The median, " and they're going

143
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,450
to say, "What's your next choice? What's
your last choice?" So you're going to have

144
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,220
somebody there that knows. You really
don't want to draw from that one unless it

145
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,650
is your last choice. Okay, what can happen
if the patient's on blood thinners?

146
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,501
Cassie, what's the most important thing to
remember about the patient

147
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,201
that's on blood thinners?

148
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,711
- [Cassie] To keep pressure.

149
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:40,261
- To keep pressure. Okay. How do you clean
your site, Martika?

150
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:42,430
- [Martika] In a circular outward motion.

151
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,291
- Circular, you don't ever go back over.
And how long do you leave

152
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,361
the tourniquet on, Faye?
- [Faye] One minute.

153
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:56,881
- One minute. Good job. Okay. You all get
your... First thing you do is what?

154
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,391
- Gloves.

155
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:01,511
- Get your gloves on. So you all are
going to draw.

156
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:08,001
- With drawing blood, are you supposed to
record where you drew at and everything

157
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,041
just like a nurse is supposed to?

158
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:15,800
- I would if I were you, because that just
protects you. So you can write median. You

159
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:26,131
can write an MC, median cubital, and that
way you may... actually you could put it on

160
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:31,200
where you put your initials where you draw.
And that way they know that you

161
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,551
drew from the median. That you didn't draw
from basilic.

162
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,501
- I need another needle.

163
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:43,771
- Okay. 

164
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:56,991
Anybody else need another needle?

165
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,900
- Thank you.

166
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:07,290
- You're welcome. I'm going to send
tourniquets home with you all and you can

167
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:14,161
practice on everybody. Feel their veins,
feel all the different types of veins.

168
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:20,021
Some people have garden hoses is what I
call them. Some people have very large

169
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:27,921
veins. And feel for your vein.

170
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,100
- The tourniquet pinched my thumb.

171
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:45,512
- The gloves are hard to... you trading
them out? It's this arm, Jim, I think

172
00:14:45,512 --> 00:14:48,132
because I had trouble getting it.
- When I was doing it, too.

173
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:51,072
- Okay. Just make it a little
tighter with your...

174
00:14:51,503 --> 00:14:55,413
- Oh.
- Did you stick yourself?

175
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,063
- Mm-mm.
- Okay.

176
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,873
- I screwed the wrong part.

177
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,653
- I think she's bleeding and I haven't
even done anything yet.

178
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:08,713
- Oh, yeah hand me another one.

179
00:15:08,713 --> 00:15:10,883
- There it goes again.

180
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:18,153
- Okay, Casey. Let me see what I can do
for you. Good job, Martika.

181
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:22,803
- Want to just chill, how's the weather,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

182
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:28,720
- Is it not come undone now? You might
want to pull your tail, just pull it in

183
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,163
there with one of the smaller tails.
It'll stay down.

184
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:40,474
- Okay.
- It's moving again.

185
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:42,584
- You're kidding.
- See?

186
00:15:42,584 --> 00:15:47,124
- Okay. Just keep going.
- Okay.

187
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:55,014
- Just keep going. It's easier on a
person. That's my stomach, Jim.

188
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:57,264
It's hungry. Sorry.

189
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:10,500
- [inaudible] Yeah, this one...
Jim knows which ones stay better. Okay,

190
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,510
you got to anchor your vein with your
non-dominant... with your non-dominant hand

191
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,204
you anchor your vein.

192
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:24,280
I have to stand. I can't... see, you take
your thumb and you pull down here.

193
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:31,274
Anchor your vein. There you go. Casey,
are you left-handed, too?

194
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:35,004
- Mm-mm. I thought you said non-dominant
hand.

195
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:39,434
- Non-dominant hand to anchor. Back it
out. Put it in this hand.

196
00:16:39,434 --> 00:16:41,354
Are you right-handed?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:43,714
- Put non-dominant hand thumb there,
anchor.

198
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:45,414
- Okay.
- Now, did you clean it?

199
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,544
- Yep.
- Okay. Then go in.

200
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:51,345
- Uh-oh.
- It's okay.

201
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,905
- It's okay.

202
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,935
[Background Chatter]

203
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:59,415
- Well, that's okay. Put that on.
- Start over.

204
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:03,000
- A lot of this is hand movement. A lot of
this is prac--
