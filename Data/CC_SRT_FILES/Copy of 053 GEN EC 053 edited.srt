1
00:00:00,118 --> 00:00:09,327
(Background Chatter)

2
00:00:09,327 --> 00:00:11,544
- [Teacher] Everybody's
using their directions,

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,365
they have their tools
and their charts out!

4
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,369
We've found today's date,

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,876
so we know where we're
going to record today.

6
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,772
It's Wednesday, March Ninth.

7
00:00:24,803 --> 00:01:41,000
(Background Chatter)

8
00:00:41,00 --> 00:00:44,800
-[Student] I know what numbers 
down of zero mean.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They are negative numbers.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,500
That's what are numbers that
are down from zero.

11
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,019
(teacher clapping rhythmically)

12
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,034
(students clapping in response)

13
00:01:10,688 --> 00:01:12,313
- [Teacher] OK, I have most
friends with their hands

14
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:15,285
on their heads, I want to make
sure everybody's listening

15
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,137
and ready to move on.

16
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:21,183
We can keep all of our materials out

17
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,232
so we can actually use them.

18
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,716
Excellent.

19
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:28,531
I'm waiting on a few more people

20
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,108
to have their hands off of their materials

21
00:01:31,108 --> 00:01:33,290
and on their heads, so we can concentrate

22
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,398
on the teacher.

23
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:41,951
In each group I have one team member

24
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,732
that will be measuring temperature.

25
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:46,200
If you are measuring the temperature,

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,016
please hold up your tool
that you'll be using.

27
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,862
Those of you measuring the temperature,

28
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:57,007
what tool are you using? Everybody?

29
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:58,533
- [Students] Thermometer!

30
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,312
- [Teacher] Very good!

31
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:01,866
The people that are
measuring the temperature

32
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:02,969
with the thermometers,

33
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:05,203
please line up at the back
door of the classroom.

34
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:19,964
When you get out there, boys and girls,

35
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,692
are you going to be able
to see the temperature

36
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,550
as soon as you get out there?

37
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,943
What are you going to have to do?

38
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:28,044
- [Students] Look at the thermometer.

39
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:31,712
- [Teacher] And you can also
compare it to the thermometer

40
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:34,266
that's been outside, so
go out there and you can

41
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:38,556
let your thermometers adjust
to the temperature of outside.

42
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,394
If you have a windsock and
you are going to measure

43
00:02:47,988 --> 00:02:52,585
the direction of the wind,

44
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:56,061
I would like you to line
up quietly at the back door

45
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:57,588
of the classroom.

46
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:07,316
You guys can use the
compass and work together,

47
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:09,702
go ahead out and see what you observe.

48
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:13,770
If you have an anemometer
to measure wind speed,

49
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,088
you may line up.

50
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:30,193
If you have a ruler to
measure precipitation

51
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:32,618
in our rain gauges, you may line up.

52
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,684
You may all go.

53
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:41,457
And last but definitely not least,

54
00:03:41,457 --> 00:03:43,948
if you are measuring the(Background Chatter) .

55
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,283
(Background Chatter)

56
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,990
- [Student] When we
look at this (Background Chatter),

57
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,364
our thingy goes away!

58
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,862
- [Student] No, yours is 61!

59
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:55,043
- [Student] No, it's the
Fahrenheit, not the Celsius.

60
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:56,830
- [Student] There's something in there.

61
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,549
- [Student] What team are you?

62
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,290
- [Student] 66.

63
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,181
- [Teachers] You guys, we need
to wait for how many seconds?

64
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,003
- [Student] It's not ready yet!

65
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:09,357
- [Teacher] You've been doing it at home.

66
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,354
What is it that you've been waiting?

67
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,815
- [Student] How can it be 110?

68
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,113
How can it be?

69
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:19,990
(Background Chatter)

70
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,818
- [Teacher] Now we are
going to set the timer

71
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,058
for 10 seconds and we are going to count

72
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,607
how many times it went around. OK?

73
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:34,689
So see where your (mumbles) is

74
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:36,448
and get ready to start counting.

75
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:39,565
(Background Chatter)

76
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,971
- [Student] Look at the bee!

77
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,512
(Background Chatter)

78
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,162
- [Teacher] I've heard both
of these ladies say two.

79
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:56,104
What you need to do is you
need to use that chart in there

80
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:57,568
and see what it means.

81
00:04:57,568 --> 00:05:00,962
What is the wind speed if the anemometer

82
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:04,341
goes around two times in 10 seconds?

83
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:08,967
- [Student] Look with
your eye, with one eye,

84
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,320
look at this one.

85
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,653
-[Student] I can't see!

86
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,716
- [Student] I think it's going West.

87
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:21,957
- [Teacher] When you
have completed measuring,

88
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:26,328
you may walk back to your
group to record your data.

89
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,738
Quietly.

90
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,976
- [Student] I got 66.

91
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:39,148
- [Teacher] Can we compare it
to what's on the wall there,

92
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,448
and see what we have?

93
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:41,865
- [Student] It got 66, then it got 65,

94
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:44,355
and then it got 64!

95
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:47,070
- [Teacher] Victor, could
you explain it all to me,

96
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,896
why you think you
thermometer keeps going down?

97
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:53,409
- [Student] Because it gets colder.

98
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,243
- [Teacher] And where has the thermometer

99
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:56,589
been sitting all day?

100
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,843
- [Student] In there.

101
00:05:57,843 --> 00:05:59,329
- [Teacher] And do you
think it's cooler out here,

102
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:01,129
or is it warmer out here?

103
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,510
- [Student] Cooler?

104
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,426
- [Teacher] Exactly! So
our temperature is going?

105
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,424
- [Student] Down!

106
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,374
- [Teacher] Good! So let's
go ahead and look right here

107
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:09,533
to make sure we can tell the temperature

108
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,331
from our thermometer that's
been staying outside?

109
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,638
- [Student] It's getting brown!

110
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:19,041
- [Teacher] What do we think
the temperature is there?

111
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:25,361
- [Student] It says the
temperature is 46 degrees.

112
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,753
- [Teacher] That's probably
our most accurate reading

113
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:35,213
since it has been staying
outside all day long.

114
00:06:35,213 --> 00:06:38,296
All right. You can head
back in and record.

115
00:06:38,296 --> 00:06:40,037
(Background Chatter)

116
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:42,430
- [Student] I don't know
which number to choose!

117
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,633
- [Teacher] The one on the
outside, the whole time.

118
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:48,402
(Background Chatter)

119
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,367
- [Student] What's your --

120
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:02,803
- [Student] Gym? It's on
Wednesday, March Ninth.

121
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,835
- [Student] It was West!

122
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,015
(Background Chatter)

123
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:17,525
- [Student] The wind direction was West.

124
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:21,888
- [Student] The wind direction was West.

125
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:26,084
- [Teacher] Very good.
I think that you have

126
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,332
an accurate reading.

127
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,144
- [Student] What's the wind speed?

128
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,439
- [Student] It's cloudy.

129
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:37,195
- [Student] Wind direction, temperature!

130
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,696
- [Teacher] Team Three
is working together,

131
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:45,448
and Team Two, and Team One!

132
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:47,595
Nice job working together!

133
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,790
- [Student] I think you have to change it.

134
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,960
- [Student] Temperature! Victor!
What was the temperature?

135
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,592
- [Student] 40 degrees.

136
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,379
- [Student] 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

137
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,445
- [Student] It was 50!

138
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:03,462
- [Student] What was the wind speed?

139
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:09,584
- [Student] It's not raining.

140
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,606
- [Teacher] So what did you
guys think the (Background Chatter) was?

141
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:22,118
- [Teacher] I agree with you.

142
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:28,738
Why would we forecast that it might rain?

143
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:31,471
(Background Chatter)

144
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,087
- [Student] What's the weather?

145
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:45,977
- [Student] The weather is rainy!

146
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,881
- [Student] West! Put West!

147
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,769
(Background Chatter)

148
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,032
- [Student] It was West.

149
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,043
- [Student] It was West?

150
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:08,855
- [Teacher] We found
out that the wind speed,

151
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:10,692
we said it went around
about that many times,

152
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:13,693
so how fast is the wind actually going?

153
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,282
- [Students] Minutes!

154
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,586
- [Teacher] Miles per hour?

155
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:23,081
We don't go anywhere in a minute.

156
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:26,395
We travel, like we said,
in cars, in miles. Right?

157
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,094
Go back to your group,
they'll tell you on the chart.

158
00:09:35,415 --> 00:09:38,231
- [Student] My thermometer's
higher than the one outside.

159
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,815
- [Teacher] We discussed that while

160
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:40,801
we were standing out there.

161
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:43,577
Why do you think that
that may not have dropped

162
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,502
as far down or might even be going back up

163
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,521
as you're holding it inside right now?

164
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,932
- [Student] Because
inside of you it's warm.

165
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,629
Because you told us that it was,

166
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:56,519
when you're holding the thermometer,

167
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,755
the thermometer only
feels what's around it.

168
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:04,379
And if we're covering the
thermometer it can't measure

169
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,598
any more temperature, only
how our temperature is.

170
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:10,257
- [Teacher] Very good.

171
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,143
So, Linda, if that answered your question,

172
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:15,361
that's why we compared it to
the thermometer that's been

173
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,116
staying outside that we check each day.

174
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:27,135
What are we going to say
that the temperature was

175
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:29,076
from that thermometer reading out there?

176
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:31,352
- [Student] 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

177
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,848
- [Teacher] Excellent, so
make sure you're sharing that,

178
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:36,651
and each person in your
group, use your data!

179
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:37,864
Linda.

180
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:41,626
(Background Chatter)

181
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,844
I think you've done an excellent job.

182
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,358
(teacher clapping rhythmically)

183
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,303
(students clapping in response)

184
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,594
- [Teacher] OK! We have a few minutes left,

185
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,579
and some groups are getting to the point

186
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,156
where they have finished
recording their data

187
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:16,011
after working with their
team members on each type

188
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:19,318
of weather and using the
different weather instruments.

189
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:23,277
I am going to pass out
your follow-up questions

190
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:25,657
and you're going to
use data from last week

191
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:27,979
and compare it to today's data

192
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,615
to do some equations on here,

193
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:32,878
and you do not have to finish today.

194
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,176
We will do this in our follow-up lesson

195
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,946
in our next science lesson. OK?

196
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:40,022
You may continue working.

197
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,166
Thank you.

198
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:44,474
(Background Chatter)

199
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,410
- [Teacher] Write your
name and date and you can

200
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,861
put it back in your
packet when you clean up.

201
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:53,475
(Background Chatter)

202
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,255
OK, the wind direction?

203
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:19,001
Who should you be asking that to?

204
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,722
- [Student] Today's?

205
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:44,077
(Background Chatter)

206
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:47,559
- [Student] Last Wednesday
the temperature was

207
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,078
57 degrees Fahrenheit.

208
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,374
What is the degrees
between today's temperature

209
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,752
and the temperature last Wednesday?

210
00:12:57,752 --> 00:13:02,227
Write an equation. Show your work.

211
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:08,057
Last Wednesday the wind speed
was eight miles per hour.

212
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,797
What is the difference between --

213
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,858
(Background Chatter)

214
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,222
- [Student] You already have your paper!

215
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:20,383
- [Student] I know!

216
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,043
- [Student] We can do it by ourselves.

217
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:25,015
- [Student] But it says to work as a team!

218
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:32,807
(Background Chatter)

219
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:37,636
- [Teacher] I like it! Good job!

220
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:39,899
"Keep working with your
team," I hear her saying.

221
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,899
Excellent! I like how I
see Brianna using her data!

222
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,580
And Grace starting to write an equation,

223
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,243
and Abby and Samaya have
the date on their paper!

224
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:55,571
You guys are all doing an excellent job!

225
00:13:56,307 --> 00:13:59,111
(Background Chatter)

226
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,016
Who is the person on
your team whose job was

227
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,994
to measure what direction it went?

228
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:13,660
You should ask that person
as soon as he comes back,

229
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,615
he should have his data on his chart.

230
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:49,107
(Background Chatter)

231
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:50,994
What number did you put there?

232
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,255
- [Student] We worked together
and we figured it out.

233
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:58,162
- [Student] I know this
one! I know this one!

234
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,421
I know that one!

235
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,612
One second!
