1
00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:02,650
- At first, we put only tap water in it,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,180
and then we all of a sudden changed it.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,015
- So, but there's still tap water in

4
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:08,594
with the oily water.

5
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:13,178
- So, you think that's why
the control got messed up

6
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,569
because it had too much
- [Voiceover] Well, that's not

7
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,409
variables changed.
- [Voiceover] my only reason.

8
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:17,570
- What's the other reason?

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,482
- My other hypothesis for the control cup

10
00:00:21,482 --> 00:00:23,532
not growing was, like...

11
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,722
the seeds were duds.

12
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:30,905
- [Voiceover] Were your
guys's the oil ones?

13
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:34,798
That one's not yours?
- [Voiceover] No.

14
00:00:34,798 --> 00:00:36,296
Ours is the one that's all grown.

15
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:37,723
- Oh, why don't you go get your cup

16
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:39,279
and show people?

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:41,728
- So this is oil?

18
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:44,782
Okay, well the oil one
did grow really fast

19
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:46,670
and all of a sudden,
it died, it looks like.

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,796
Kind of.

21
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:51,881
So, like at first, it was
normal with that thing,

22
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:52,881
and then, well--

23
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,589
- [Voiceover] I don't
understand that chart.

24
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,050
- Yeah, me neither because it looks like--

25
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,638
- It looks like it didn't grow,

26
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:00,007
then it grew really, really fast,

27
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:01,225
then it went down.

28
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:04,452
Super (mutters).

29
00:01:04,452 --> 00:01:05,614
- What happened was it grew,

30
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:09,655
and then it over-polluted,
and then it just died.

31
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:10,897
Looks like that.

32
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:12,505
- Well, like. ...

33
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:16,726
(students laugh)

34
00:01:16,726 --> 00:01:21,451
- Well, like, what I don't get
is, I see the other oil one,

35
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:24,016
it seems like the oil one is

36
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:24,957
growing bigger than the other ones.

37
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:27,402
- [Voiceover] It just, like,
suddenly grew all of a sudden.

38
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:31,116
All the oil is the same with
the control, which you have

39
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:33,686
all of a sudden, all of a
sudden, also these diagrams.

40
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:36,097
Also, in the control diagram, that went

41
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,766
back down to zero centimeters.

42
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:38,979
- I don't know.

43
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:44,326
- Yeah, this chart might have messed up.

44
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:45,544
(boy mutters)

45
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:48,703
Because that means both these plants die.

46
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:50,780
- And then the control regrew.

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,205
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it
doesn't make any sense.

48
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:54,606
- [Voiceover] It doesn't.

49
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:59,126
(students chat)

50
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:06,146
- It turned white, and then
it died and turned brown

51
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:11,267
because on my chart, it grew point...

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,354
it grew ...

53
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:20,686
it grew 0.14, and then 0.14 again,

54
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:24,267
and then 0.04, so
like alive, dead, alive and stuff.

55
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,205
- When it grew the second time,

56
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:29,655
did it grow or did it subtract?

57
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:31,283
- The second time, I think it died,

58
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:34,279
and then the last time
it just kept on growing,

59
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,565
but the first time it started growing,

60
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:41,913
it grew, second time
it grew one centimeter.

61
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,037
- What did you put in to help it grow?

62
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:46,928
What did you put in it to help it grow?

63
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:50,121
- Oily water.

64
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:54,323
- So, did the oil or the
manipulator control grow more?

65
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:59,323
- The...manipulative one (mutters)

66
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,994
grew more because it
grew and then it died.

67
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,164
- So, why do you think it did that?

68
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:11,366
- Because, like, I, what I thought

69
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:14,137
is that it was too much oil on it,

70
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,626
and then oil gets on the leaf, it like,

71
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:21,626
it helps the plant
grow or something.

72
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:26,568
Just killing other--

73
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:27,915
- Doesn't the plant feed off the leaves?

74
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:30,272
So, the oil got spread on the leaves,

75
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:33,371
and then it's feeding
the oil, then it died.

76
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,776
- Look at yours compared to mine

77
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:39,477
because yours is way more controlled ones

78
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:43,099
than ours does because the only one we had

79
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,934
was the experiment plant.

80
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:50,324
(students chat)

81
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:54,673
- Do you, I think the
reason why the vinegar

82
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:59,641
or the acid rain made
it grow because, like,

83
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:04,459
acid is good for you, and
it's mixed with water,

84
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:07,140
so it's not too bad for the plant.

85
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,579
But I think it got way too much acid,

86
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,237
and acid actually eats things.

87
00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:14,454
It kills it, and that's
why I think the plant

88
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,879
is all dead because, like you said, Nolan,

89
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:20,816
it did grow, because acid is good for us,

90
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:23,149
but yet when we have too much, it dies.

91
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:26,481
So, that's why I think this
plant is all shriveled over.

92
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,060
- I agree with you because

93
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,601
acid is part water, and
that's what rain is,

94
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:33,238
but there's a little bit of acid

95
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:36,483
so water's good for you. But acid,

96
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:39,153
it doesn't grow, it's
not good for you, so--

97
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:39,854
- [Voiceover] Well, actually,

98
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,896
it is good for you, but not a lot.

99
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:42,859
- I think you're--

100
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:46,529
- Maybe just a little bit of water

101
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,317
in it more than acid rain,

102
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:51,521
and then when we kept
spraying the acid rain on,

103
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,285
maybe it got too much acid rain.

104
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:57,324
And then the acid rain
overtook the water and died.

105
00:04:57,324 --> 00:04:59,578
So, it like decreased by a lot.

106
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:02,155
That's why I think it's just
like the Red Bull because

107
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:05,858
Red Bull is, like gives
you really much energy

108
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,320
and then you just crash
without any energy.

109
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,874
See right there?

110
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,882
Just like Red Bull.

111
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:16,063
- [Voiceover] It increases
and then decreases.

112
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,203
- What'd you think, Misha?

113
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,345
- Well, yeah.

114
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,492
I think like what you said, Nolan, because

115
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:28,078
the regular plant grew
just fine, and then that,

116
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,758
the experiment grew, like, good,

117
00:05:31,758 --> 00:05:33,314
and better than the regular one,

118
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:36,657
but then it, like, the
acid overtook the plant

119
00:05:36,657 --> 00:05:37,876
just like Nolan said.

120
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:41,230
- What else I noticed
about my control plant,

121
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,085
it started big at first, and
then it decreased in size.

122
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:48,104
Then it got bigger, so it's
going off and on in size.

123
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:49,984
So, it actually did kind
of better than this

124
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:53,560
because at the end, it
did better than that one

125
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,375
and the last opposite ...

126
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,303
- It like, died, after the second one,

127
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:06,109
it only stayed for a couple
of days or a couple weeks.

128
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:09,347
- Yeah, but it was only
to a point it was living

129
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:13,214
because, when I did my second observation,

130
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:15,674
it was still kind of full, but

131
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,937
it was broken on the side. So it started

132
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,503
falling into a point where it fell in

133
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:25,108
and got buried in the
oily water, basically.

134
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:30,903
(students chat)

135
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:34,314
- It died.

136
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,437
- My actual skin and everything,
the plant grows faster,

137
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,909
but it also dies faster, and I figured

138
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,570
from like the oils on my hand--

139
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,717
- Why do you think it did that?

140
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:48,087
- Because the oil on your hand--

141
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:51,453
Because the oil on your hand
may not be the exact same thing

142
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:55,504
as, like, oils in a car, but
oil still has the same base.

143
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:57,907
- But how does it make
the plant grow faster

144
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:59,278
if you touch it with your hand?

145
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,299
- I don't know.

146
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:02,546
Instead of wearing gloves, maybe it's just

147
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:05,102
the stuff inside of
the oils and everything,

148
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:09,367
but it grew faster, and also died faster.

149
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:11,119
Like, the plant that we
have now is dying faster,

150
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,744
but this one, since it has
water normally and everything,

151
00:07:13,744 --> 00:07:17,094
it's healthy, and stayed
big the whole time.

152
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:19,741
But the other one is like that

153
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:22,284
(mutters) but it died.

154
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:27,926
- If you have, what you
were saying earlier,

155
00:07:27,926 --> 00:07:29,480
when you have oil on your hand,

156
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,834
and then it was, you polluted it with oil,

157
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,739
don't you think you polluted that one too?

158
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:38,733
- No, well, like, it's,

159
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,299
my whole point is that it
speeded up the process.

160
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:42,762
- [Voiceover] What speeded up the process?

161
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,873
- Like the oil, when I
plant a bean or something,

162
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:49,194
when I plant bulbs for tulips or something,

163
00:07:49,194 --> 00:07:51,539
and I touch it with my
hands instead of my gloves.

164
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,800
Then it actually seems,
I may just be paranoid,

165
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,598
but it grows faster, and then my mom put

166
00:07:57,598 --> 00:07:59,943
hers with gloves and it didn't grow as fast.

167
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:03,264
I don't know the depth of
that part or something.

168
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:05,503
- I don't get what you're saying.

169
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:08,464
Are you saying that you have a magic touch

170
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:11,285
and you just make plants grow faster?

171
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:12,783
(laughs)

172
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,059
- No, I think it's just
the oils of your skin.

173
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:17,589
- So, what would the oils in
your skin do for a plant?

174
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,667
Like the oil for your plant here?

175
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,768
- Is it the same like
the oil that we used?

176
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,567
- Like, it didn't make them healthy,

177
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,820
but it just made it grow faster because

178
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,512
this one took a little
bit longer to get bigger,

179
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:30,452
but the other one--

180
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:32,936
Show me your data that suports that.

181
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,363
- This?
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

182
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:47,269
- [Voiceover] What's your
data that supports that?

183
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:50,444
- The ...

184
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,945
These ones.

185
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:57,945
- Yeah, the one the data that
supported it was that, oops,

186
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:03,128
is... (clears throat)

187
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,123
is it went with the control.

188
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:09,350
It already had grown,
and it was after a week,

189
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,101
and ours still hasn't grown. And

190
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:15,559
it was growing at 0.16 centimeters

191
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,564
per day and then the next time,

192
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:24,069
it was growing 2.7 centimeters a day.

193
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,367
- [Voiceover] So, what does that tell you?

194
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:30,082
- That it was growing a lot faster,

195
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:33,472
but it wasn't necessarily
growing as efficiently.

196
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,191
- Okay.

197
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,270
What do you mean by inefficient?

198
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,211
- Efficient.

199
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,326
- What do you mean by efficient?

200
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:43,792
- I mean, like, it grew
faster, but it wasn't

201
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,464
necessarily healthy for the
plant for it to grow so fast.

202
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,089
- So, was there other
evidence that you would use

203
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,364
that would prove that it wasn't healthy?

204
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:52,883
- Yeah, because the leaves now,

205
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,753
they're all gross and blotchy, and

206
00:09:55,753 --> 00:09:58,250
they're dying and they're crunchy

207
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,606
and not as soft and smooth as these.

208
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:03,532
And they have a shine to
them because of the oil.

209
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:06,388
- What, did the rate
of growth confirm that?

210
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:10,206
- At first, it was kind of
spiked for a little bit,

211
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:11,565
and then it started going back down,

212
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:16,311
and now it's dying a lot
faster than the natural plant

213
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:21,197
because these plants, it grows
in a steady period of time.

214
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:23,496
With that, it grew really fast,

215
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,156
and now it's dying really fast.

216
00:10:25,156 --> 00:10:27,141
- [Voiceover] So, what
conclusion did you get?

217
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:32,141
- That oil still makes the plant grow,

218
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,208
but it's not necessarily healthy for it.

219
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,729
- Do you agree?

220
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:39,382
- Yeah, because me and ...

221
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,765
Because my group,

222
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:46,648
my experiment, when we did this,

223
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:48,321
it was growing super fast,

224
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:50,328
and now it's like dying and stuff.

225
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,001
And we think that the oil

226
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:57,001
has a chemical in it that
speeds up the process

227
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,987
of the plant growing, but then it

228
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:04,987
speeds up and of slows down the process

229
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:08,096
of the plant dying because ...

230
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:13,686
- On the grass a little bit,

231
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:15,578
and the number of leaves
will only be like two,

232
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:17,018
and then it shrivels up and died.

233
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:20,919
And then the color would stay light green,

234
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,262
and kind of brown, like
how it is right now,

235
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:28,262
and then my data was,

236
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:30,542
according to my graph,

237
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,084
the acid rain plant grew
more than I thought.

238
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:36,704
It grew 25 centimeters, but

239
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:39,384
it started to die because of ...

240
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:45,876
(students chatter)

241
00:11:48,146 --> 00:11:50,785
(students chatter)

242
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:54,436
It turns light brown, and started to die.

243
00:11:54,436 --> 00:11:57,675
The leaves increased from two,

244
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,108
all the way to six leaves by the end.

245
00:12:01,285 --> 00:12:02,226
- Okay.

246
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:07,226
My question was, what would the effect be

247
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:09,377
if I changed the water to salt water,

248
00:12:09,377 --> 00:12:12,035
and I put, if I change the water to salt,

249
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,390
I predict that the plant will stay

250
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,231
the same height as the control plant.

251
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,251
I predict a number of
leaves will stay the same

252
00:12:19,251 --> 00:12:22,233
as the control plant.

253
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:25,590
I predict the color will
be white-ish gray-ish.

254
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,189
My manipulator variable
is water to salt water.

255
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:31,429
According to my data, I was correct

256
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:34,190
because the height was the same,

257
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,806
and the number of leaves were the same.

258
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:39,277
The data shows the height of both plants

259
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:42,260
were zero centimeters
and the number of leaves

260
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,222
was zero on both plants.

261
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,102
The rate of the growth was zero.

262
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:50,479
On the salt water, there was crust

263
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,769
on it, and it was ...

264
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:59,053
- [Voiceover] Restate that
so that Jessica gets it,

265
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,840
and see if Jessica knows.

266
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,954
- And then like, we were saying,

267
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:07,574
Olivia was talking about
maybe how it looks burnt,

268
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:10,302
and then, like, you know how water,

269
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:13,112
it attracts a lot of light,
and so people get tan.

270
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:13,959
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

271
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,596
- [Voiceover] Faster, and then so,

272
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:18,092
maybe the shine for the oil

273
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:21,261
maybe, it attracted more
of the heat from the light,

274
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:25,857
and it burnt the leaves, so.

275
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,250
- [Voiceover] Like, the glisten from it.

276
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,071
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

277
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:31,528
Maybe that's why it looks all burnt and...

278
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:34,651
- Because it reminded me of when you

279
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:37,669
see the old movies like
how it's a burnt reel,

280
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:38,772
- Piece of paper.

281
00:13:38,772 --> 00:13:42,931
- Something like sands off
in the reel of a video,

282
00:13:42,931 --> 00:13:46,727
and you just see a hole get
bigger on the burning screen.

283
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:47,691
That's what it kind of reminded me of...

284
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,814
- Because it has a
brown wrinkle around it.

285
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,164
- And then it's dark, and
then it's kind of brown

286
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,984
and crisp, so that's what
it kind of reminded me of

287
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,632
and that's what made me think of it.

288
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:59,788
- Yeah, and then, how
I thought of the idea of

289
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:03,666
it attracting the light and heat

290
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,648
was how Olivia said that
when you're in water,

291
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,910
it attracts more heat and light to you,

292
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,304
so maybe that's how.

293
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:15,252
So, that's how I got the idea
of maybe that's what happened.

294
00:14:17,712 --> 00:14:19,870
So, do you have anything to add, Jared?

295
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,020
- No.

296
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,389
- You, Jessica?

297
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:23,631
- No.

298
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:26,836
- Okay.

299
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,190
- Okay, so I think the reason why mine

300
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,591
didn't grow like before how

301
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,332
the salt would have absorbed the water.

302
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,432
Because when Mr. Kelson sprayed it,

303
00:14:38,432 --> 00:14:40,860
all of the salt right
here, you could feel it.

304
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,091
It's all stuck to the top, so the water

305
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:47,232
can't get down to the soil and all that.

306
00:14:47,232 --> 00:14:48,462
So, it can't grow at all.

307
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:53,462
(students chat)

308
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,520
(students chat)
