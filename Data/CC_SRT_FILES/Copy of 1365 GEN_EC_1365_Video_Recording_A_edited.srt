1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,830
(children talking over each other)

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,502
- Tyler pushed the ball.

3
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:06,253
- [Miss Henderson] Okay,
well how does that,

4
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:07,599
how does that

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,276
affect the ball?

6
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:11,609
- It makes it go faster.

7
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,621
And make it fall.

8
00:00:14,621 --> 00:00:16,959
- [Miss Henderson] So
why is that a problem?

9
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:20,792
- Because she ran because
she, because she pushed it.

10
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:23,843
- [Miss Henderson] I know, but why is it

11
00:00:23,843 --> 00:00:25,638
a problem that she pushed it?

12
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:26,555
- Because

13
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:29,218
it goes faster.

14
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:33,969
- [Miss Henderson] And
that's a problem because?

15
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:34,802
Because why?

16
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,710
- She didn't win.

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,834
- [Miss Henderson] Oh,
what do you mean win?

18
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:40,672
- She win the game.

19
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:42,837
- [Miss Henderson] Oh, did
you all make a game out of it?

20
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,407
- Uh uh, we didn't turn a game into it.

21
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,735
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, well
what are you doing then?

22
00:00:47,735 --> 00:00:50,151
He's playing a game, what
are you doing Kylie?

23
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,459
- He's rolling and see, not playing a game.

24
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:56,078
Just rolling and seeing where they go.

25
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:57,100
- [Miss Henderson] Wait a minute what?

26
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,245
Rolling them to see what?

27
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,495
- How many sticks it takes.

28
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,482
- [Miss Henderson] So
did you push all of them

29
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:05,282
or are you all taking turns doing each one?

30
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,115
- Taking turns.

31
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:07,163
- [Miss Henderson] Oh, okay.

32
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:08,957
So do you think that

33
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:10,755
to find out really how far they go

34
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:12,751
everyone either needs to push them

35
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,038
or everyone needs to not push them?

36
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:16,095
- Not push them.

37
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:17,404
- [Miss Henderson] So is
that what you're saying,

38
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:18,672
it wouldn't be fair if she pushes hers,

39
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:20,836
but no one else pushes theirs?

40
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:23,778
Because pushing makes
it go faster you said.

41
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:24,611
Okay.

42
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:25,655
Alright so,

43
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:27,072
it makes it what?

44
00:01:28,744 --> 00:01:30,953
Makes it go farther okay.

45
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:32,265
Alright, so do you wanna,

46
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:33,098
do you want,

47
00:01:33,098 --> 00:01:35,366
was anybody else pushing theirs?

48
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:36,755
- [Kylie] Rebekah.

49
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,221
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, do
you want Rebekah and Kylie

50
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,405
to do theirs over again?

51
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:41,281
Alright, show them how
you and Todd did yours

52
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,698
so that everybody can do theirs the same.

53
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:53,274
- Now I guess I'm gonna
have to get our ball.

54
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:57,441
(children talking over each other)

55
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,236
- I need ball number two. We need a Captain.

56
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:16,805
- Miss Henderson, can I be the Captain?

57
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,572
- [Miss Henderson] We
don't need a Captain.

58
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:21,923
You're all doing what,

59
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:23,423
you're being what?

60
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:26,815
We're not being Captain's,
we're being what?

61
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:27,792
- [Todd] Scientists.

62
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,015
- [Miss Henderson] Scientists.

63
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,432
So work together.

64
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:35,179
(children talking over each other)

65
00:02:35,179 --> 00:02:36,935
- [Miss Henderson] Wait,
don't pick up her ball.

66
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:39,185
She hasn't measured it yet.

67
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,768
- Five, six, seven, eight,

68
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:46,788
nine, 10, 11,

69
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:49,404
12, 13, 14, 15,

70
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,050
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

71
00:02:56,898 --> 00:02:59,231
21 inches that my ball went.

72
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,232
- [Miss Henderson] 21 sticks.

73
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,619
- Where is 21?

74
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:14,412
- [Miss Henderson] You looking
for it on the hundreds chart?

75
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,205
Are you looking for it on the calendar?

76
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,795
You can get up and point to it.

77
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,837
- [Todd] I got 18 sticks for my ball.

78
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:24,043
- [Rebekah] I can't find it anywhere.
- 18 sticks.

79
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:28,210
- I'm going to see how many sticks I got for my ball.

80
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:44,289
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, how
would you find 21 on the chart?

81
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,111
- I don't know.

82
00:03:46,111 --> 00:03:48,289
- [Miss Henderson] Where could you start?

83
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,555
- By one.

84
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:51,186
- [Miss Henderson] Okay.

85
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:53,436
(counting)

86
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,496
(children talking over each other)

87
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,242
- 20,

88
00:04:03,104 --> 00:04:04,452
21.

89
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,369
- [Miss Henderson] Oh, you found it.

90
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,900
Do you need more sticks honey?

91
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,733
- 17, yes.

92
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,741
- [Miss Henderson] Okay,
go ask another group,

93
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,191
can you borrow some sticks?

94
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:16,441
- Another ball.

95
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,526
(children talking over each other)

96
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:25,589
- 12,

97
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,608
13,

98
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:33,902
14.

99
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,163
So it takes half of 14.

100
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,369
- Because she said, "No, I'm using it."

101
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:50,881
And she, and I said I have a idea

102
00:04:50,881 --> 00:04:52,919
and she said no.

103
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,468
- [Miss Henderson] What
was your idea John?

104
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:57,160
- I was just trying
do it on my head, like on

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,860
my back of my head then down.

106
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,206
- [Miss Henderson] Use
your head as a ramp?

107
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,561
- Uh huh.

108
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,960
- [Miss Henderson] And where
did you have the ball hun?

109
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
- In her pocket the whole time.

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,717
- [Miss Henderson] Why Em?

111
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:11,651
Does the ball belong
to you or to the group?

112
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,671
- Group.

113
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:14,264
- [Miss Henderson] So
if you're not using it,

114
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:16,225
should you let someone
else in the group use it?

115
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,452
Okay,

116
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:18,285
go ahead.

117
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:24,759
(children talking over each other)

118
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:37,412
(children talking over each other)

119
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:46,005
- Roll it on my back.

120
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:47,764
And now roll it.

121
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,931
If it does it...

122
00:05:57,364 --> 00:05:58,281
Right here.

123
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,101
No, I mean like right here.

124
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,788
- [Miss Henderson] Where
do you want them to,

125
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,219
where do you want them to start the ball?

126
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,645
I think is what they're asking.

127
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:28,913
- In my head,

128
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:31,370
somewhere like right here.

129
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,639
- [Miss Henderson] Because
a ramp starts where?

130
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,575
- On the top.

131
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,293
- [Miss Henderson] Up high.

132
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:38,518
And goes down.

133
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:41,086
So if you're using his head?

134
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:43,366
- I would lay like this.

135
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,199
- [Miss Henderson] Oh.

136
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,083
Did that work?

137
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:53,916
- Yeah.

138
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:58,791
- [Rebekah] What do we do
with it, after we do our balls?

139
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,706
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, you
can just keep experimenting

140
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:02,497
with the balls and the ramps
and we're gonna clean up

141
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:03,914
in just a second.

142
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:09,433
Put your name at the top
of your paper please.

143
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,292
- [Child] We used it on this one.

144
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,945
- [Miss Henderson] You're supposed to do

145
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,204
all four of the balls.

146
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:16,674
Ball number one, ball number two,

147
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,385
ball number three, ball number four.

148
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,968
- [Child] We would do
ball number three?

149
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,473
- Number one is this one.

150
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,810
How about number one?

151
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,060
- But this one.

152
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,915
Which number is that one?

153
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:43,714
- So get number three,
we'll have a race and we'll...

154
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:50,711
(children talking over each other)

155
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:04,090
(children talking over each other)

156
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:09,603
(children talking over each other)

157
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:12,534
- [Miss Henderson] So what are
you all doing with the ramp now?

158
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,373
- We're putting it on the chair.

159
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:19,231
And whoever gets it, whoever
gets down to the bottom first.

160
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:23,398
(children talking over each other)

161
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:33,356
- We were actually gonna roll off it.

162
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:36,385
- [Miss Henderson] Well, why
won't it roll off that ramp?

163
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,385
Because why?

164
00:08:40,374 --> 00:08:41,964
What stops it?

165
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:42,797
- The block.

166
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:46,231
- [Miss Henderson] The
block stops it, okay.

167
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:47,064
So.

168
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:54,230
- How much does it go?

169
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:57,002
Try the little one.

170
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,698
Whoever is in front of me move.

171
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:10,490
- I got 10.

172
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:19,578
(children talking over each other)

173
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:29,448
- Miss Henderson,
everybody is taking our balls.

174
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:30,835
- [Miss Henderson] Okay,
guys I would like for you to

175
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,648
clean up your things please.

176
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:35,283
I saw some great science learning,

177
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:39,321
science work, put everything
back in your basket

178
00:09:39,321 --> 00:09:42,986
and then please meet me on the rug.

179
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:46,097
(children talking over each other)

180
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:48,430
Put your paper at your seat.

181
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:50,646
Quickly.

182
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,446
Let's see how quickly we can clean up.

183
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:54,632
Id like for you to come to the rug

184
00:09:54,632 --> 00:09:57,038
and share some things you've learned.

185
00:09:57,038 --> 00:10:00,017
John, you have to put everything
back in your basket buddy.

186
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,305
All the sticks and balls please.

187
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:06,472
And then you may put your
basket on the art table.

188
00:10:07,812 --> 00:10:11,979
(children talking over each other)

189
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:19,372
Thank you to everybody
who's moving quickly.

190
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:27,381
Thank you to everybody
who's moving quickly.

191
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:34,536
(children talking over each other)

192
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:36,626
(children talking over each other)

193
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,204
Okay, let's come to the rug and let's share

194
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:42,121
some things that you learned today.

195
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:46,471
Move that way please.

196
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:49,241
I said put your paper
at your seat for now.

197
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,066
- Miss Henderson, Braxton
said this isn't whistling.

198
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:52,899
(whistles)

199
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,194
- [Miss Henderson] Okay,
well we're not gonna debate

200
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:55,217
whistling right now.

201
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:58,849
Okay, thanks so much for
everybody coming back to the rug.

202
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:01,624
Okay, I would like to know

203
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:04,561
who learned something about

204
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,969
balls or ramps or forces

205
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:09,219
in your science work today?

206
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:15,300
Tell us something you did,
something you figured out.

207
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,322
Bryson.

208
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:17,155
- If you push the ball

209
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:21,380
it goes farther.

210
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,297
If you don't push the
ball it goes not farther.

211
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,691
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, alright.

212
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:31,672
Who else learned something else
through their science work?

213
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:32,505
John.

214
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,838
- That when you put like

215
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,186
a stick in front of it

216
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:43,310
and then you put another
ball in front of it

217
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,408
and then like you roll the ball

218
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,490
and see how much it goes.

219
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,237
And then you try another ball

220
00:11:50,237 --> 00:11:53,130
and see like if it gets to the stick

221
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,963
and if it doesn't get to the stick

222
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:58,847
then it gets farther and,

223
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:02,871
and we tried whoever gets to the stick.

224
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,817
It goes, it's the same height

225
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:08,861
then we just rolled it

226
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,194
and then the green ball got the farthest.

227
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,439
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, the green, okay.

228
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,607
Todd, what's something you learned today

229
00:12:19,607 --> 00:12:20,997
through your science work?

230
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:24,387
- If you push it it'll
go farther and that's it.

231
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:26,631
- [Miss Henderson] Okay,
alright anything else

232
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,508
we haven't mentioned, Eli?

233
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:29,341
- There's a block

234
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,984
in front of it

235
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,879
and if you move the block a little it,

236
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,101
it will go past it.

237
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,226
If you make a ball,

238
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:47,899
if you make a block go
all the way across it

239
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,982
and you have a big ball
it might bounce across it

240
00:12:53,248 --> 00:12:54,665
or it might stop.

241
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,150
- [Miss Henderson] So the
block stopped it sometimes?

242
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,983
- Yes.

243
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:00,309
- [Miss Henderson] Sometimes
the ball was going fast enough

244
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:01,983
to jump over it?
- Yeah.

245
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:03,288
But sometimes it stopped it.

246
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:04,121
Okay,

247
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:05,126
Grayson.

248
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:07,793
- Well, sometimes what I did was

249
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:11,502
I kinda put the ramp like that

250
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,008
and a little block across

251
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,415
and then I was rolling this big ball

252
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:17,704
and once it hit it, it kinda like

253
00:13:17,704 --> 00:13:19,911
jumped up in the air and went--

254
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:20,744
- [Miss Henderson] Harleigh.

255
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:21,952
- And moved in.

256
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:25,589
And for like three
blocks for three sticks.

257
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,385
- [Miss Henderson] Okay, Preston,

258
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:29,141
what did you learn today?

259
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,487
- If you, like if your hand go fast,

260
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:34,076
the ball goes fast.

261
00:13:34,076 --> 00:13:37,096
If your hand goes slow,
the ball goes slow.

262
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,319
- [Miss Henderson] If your hand goes fast,

263
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,155
what do you mean by if
your hand goes fast?

264
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:44,278
- Like if you're at the bottom
and (mumbles)

265
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:45,793
and you do that.

266
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:48,121
And go like that it goes fast.

267
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:50,207
- [Miss Henderson] What is
that called that you're doing?

268
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,613
- Pushing the thing.

269
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:55,348
- [Miss Henderson] So if you
push the ball fast it goes fast

270
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,183
and if you push it slow, it goes slow?

271
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:58,016
- The force.

272
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:58,856
- [Miss Henderson] Interesting.

273
00:13:58,856 --> 00:14:01,304
The force of pushing, okay Chloe.

274
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:05,553
- I learned that
when you lay it diagonal

275
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,146
it goes--

276
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,577
- [Miss Henderson] When
you lay what diagonal?

277
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:11,410
- What is it

278
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,826
called again?

279
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,662
- [Miss Henderson] What?

280
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:18,162
- A diagonal line.

281
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:22,056
- When you lay it down diagonal

282
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:23,771
it goes down faster.

283
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:26,796
- [Miss Henderson] What is she
talking about Eli, the what?

284
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:29,409
- She's talking about a ramp.

285
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:30,307
- [Miss Henderson] Oh the ramp,

286
00:14:30,307 --> 00:14:31,576
when you lay the ramp diagonal?

287
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:32,659
- Uh huh.

288
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:35,572
The ball goes fast.
When you lay it straight

289
00:14:35,572 --> 00:14:38,591
it doesn't go fast, it just sits there.

290
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,061
- [Miss Henderson] Oh, so if it's,

291
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:41,693
if it's less.

292
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:44,351
If it's a lower ramp it goes less.

293
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,007
If it's a higher diagonal
ramp you're talking about,

294
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:48,639
then it goes farther?

295
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,222
Interesting, Brody?

296
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,579
- We tried it with our heads like down

297
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:57,865
and the ball goes down like that.

298
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:58,964
- [Miss Henderson] So you made,

299
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,049
you made ramps with your bodies?

300
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,132
So did it go-
