1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,923
(background chatter)

2
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:13,124
- [Teacher] Five, four,
three, two, one, stop.

3
00:00:13,124 --> 00:00:14,424
I'm going to follow
the same norms you are,

4
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:15,213
so if I want to talk,

5
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:16,258
I'm going to have to raise my hand.

6
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,394
Does anybody want to start us off?

7
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,229
Sort of an initial response,

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,715
or something that's been on your mind,

9
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,340
or a place we can go in the play

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:30,770
to start this conversation?

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,837
- [Girl with glasses] In the last act,

12
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:35,042
when Emilia and Iago,

13
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,203
or Iago's been caught,

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,942
and Emilia is piecing
together all of these things

15
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:41,520
that Iago's done, how it all works,

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,373
and she's telling the others
around him what he's done,

17
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,556
he keeps telling her,

18
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:50,669
"Be quiet, this isn't your place to talk,

19
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:52,201
"you shouldn't be here."

20
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:56,195
But, whereas most stereotypical women

21
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:57,193
would have just kind of

22
00:00:57,193 --> 00:00:58,424
followed what their husband wanted,

23
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:01,164
and just you know, kind
of been in the background,

24
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:02,603
Emilia actually stands up

25
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:07,665
and says what she thinks is right.

26
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:10,266
- (mumbles)
- [Girl in glasses] Yeah, okay.

27
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:12,239
- What (mumbles) also talked about

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,097
was how Desdemona kind of juxtaposes that

29
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:18,439
in that she's like the very
stereotypical housewife,

30
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,364
to the point at which
she refuses to even like

31
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:24,151
blame her husband for killing her,

32
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,681
so we kind of, it's interesting how

33
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:31,836
those two characters are just...

34
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:33,810
- [Chloe] To touch on the racism part,

35
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,619
I would have to say it's not,

36
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,568
and at least if it is,
that isn't the main focus

37
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,961
of the play.

38
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,608
I'd say that it's focused more on these

39
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:47,578
complex characters and their web of lies,

40
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,920
and the plot itself isn't focused on,

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,430
if it is, I think (mumbles)

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,256
because I don't really think it is.

43
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,926
- [Boy with glasses] I
kind of agree with Chloe.

44
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:06,850
I don't think that Othello
is a racist or sexist play.

45
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,892
It does have racism and sexism in it,

46
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:13,514
but that's because it was
written by William Shakespeare

47
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:16,161
in a time when that was the norm.

48
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:18,924
You can't really look at
it as a modern person,

49
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:21,850
because we think of racism and sexism

50
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,309
so differently from the
audience it was intended for.

51
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:28,271
They thought of it as more of the norm,

52
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:30,348
so it does seem more normal.

53
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:34,179
Like it seemed believable
and normal to them,

54
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:40,496
because that's just how their society was.

55
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,561
- [Blond girl] Then it
also kind of looks at like

56
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:43,722
how racism sort of caused it,

57
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:46,810
like Iago hates Othello,

58
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,993
and one reason that he gives is that

59
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:51,315
he's black and he doesn't
deserve his position,

60
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:56,516
and he kind of uses race to his advantage

61
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:57,607
to do bad things.

62
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,929
So it's kind of looking at,

63
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,717
it's not racist, it's looking at racism

64
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,992
and sexism, and saying like how

65
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:11,144
they can be used and
manipulated, you know?

66
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:12,305
- [Girl in blue] Yeah, I
kind of agree with you.

67
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:13,582
I think this play is really about like

68
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:16,020
taking advantage of
people any way you can.

69
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,622
So like if you have something on them,

70
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:18,783
like they're a different color,

71
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,106
or if they're a different sex,

72
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:22,023
then you can use that to your advantage

73
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:27,568
by like putting that as an
excuse almost, to take advantage.

74
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,123
- [Teacher] Let's return to that.

75
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,865
Raise your hand if Iago was

76
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:34,649
your favorite character in this class.

77
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,368
Come on.

78
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:40,663
I mean, this is a, I have to say, I agree.

79
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,776
I would raise my hand to that question,

80
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:43,844
which I find troubling,

81
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:46,120
because I certainly agree with

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,675
some of the opinions
that I'm hearing here,

83
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:50,787
that we have this interesting contrast

84
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:52,458
between Emilia and Desdemona,

85
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:57,729
as two different ways women
can live with male violence,

86
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,471
and we also have this examination of how

87
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,234
racism and sexism are
used as part of the plot

88
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,370
to take down Othello.

89
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,600
But at the same time,

90
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,874
I have to say, I think that it feels to me

91
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,218
like the play is set up
for us like Iago more.

92
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:15,283
Iago talks to us, he
lets us into his world,

93
00:04:15,283 --> 00:04:17,976
into his mind in a way
that nobody else does.

94
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:21,459
So I'd almost feel like
we can't blame ourselves

95
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:23,827
as the audience for identifying with him,

96
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:26,939
for secretly making part
of us rooting for him,

97
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,073
or he even made me sort like glorying

98
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:34,787
in his intelligence and his
capacity for manipulation

99
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:37,503
and just his power.

100
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,034
And I wonder what we do with that,

101
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,659
because if you walk away
from this play being like,

102
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,378
"I love Iago!"

103
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:45,258
Then aren't you also kind of saying,

104
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:50,181
in a way, celebrating what he's done?

105
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:55,196
Do you agree with me? Disagree with me?

106
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,215
- [Girl with head turned] I
think his ability to like,

107
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:03,876
his like logic, and how
he like plans things,

108
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,718
like how he like manipulates
a lot of situations,

109
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:09,759
and how he like schemes
to like use people's

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,965
like baggage, I guess, to his advantage,

111
00:05:11,965 --> 00:05:15,935
is kind of like I guess
like the way he uses it

112
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:16,957
isn't a good way,

113
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:19,836
but like if you could use
it in a different way,

114
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,924
I guess it like could be
viewed as like a good thing.

115
00:05:22,924 --> 00:05:26,430
So, (mumbles)

116
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,079
- I think there's a
difference between like

117
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,263
celebrating what he's done,

118
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,444
and just appreciating
like the amount of thought

119
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:36,949
and like intelligence that he
has in using it in a bad way,

120
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,735
because like you can like Iago,

121
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:42,870
and like him for different reasons than,

122
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,845
"Oh, I like what he's done,

123
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,377
"I like how he destroyed this person."

124
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,606
It can be just, you know, "I realize that

125
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:48,628
"this is a very smart person,

126
00:05:48,628 --> 00:05:50,462
"and someone I really
would not want to be on

127
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:52,552
his bad side."

128
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:55,547
But like you just sort of,

129
00:05:55,547 --> 00:06:01,282
you realize like how much, I guess yeah,

130
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:02,908
I'll just use the word appreciate again.

131
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,486
You just appreciate like how much,

132
00:06:04,486 --> 00:06:09,641
you understand his mind, and
it's just really interesting,

133
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:13,077
rather than you love him.

134
00:06:13,077 --> 00:06:14,215
- Yeah, I think it's more like,

135
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:16,142
sometime's it's fun to like root for like

136
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,744
the evil character.

137
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,091
Because you wouldn't actually do it,

138
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,622
like if you play video
games like Grand Theft Auto,

139
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:23,944
(students laugh)

140
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:25,592
Like you kill the hookers, it's not like--

141
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,264
(students laugh)

142
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,006
you would have to do that,
it's just that it's fun.

143
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:33,604
(students laugh)

144
00:06:33,604 --> 00:06:35,491
- [Boy] Oh my God!

145
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:48,029
(background chatter)

146
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:49,259
- [Girl with glasses] Well,
it doesn't surprise me

147
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,024
that Iago's the one that most people

148
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,160
come away from the play with being like,

149
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,923
"Yeah, he's so great, he's
so interesting," right?

150
00:06:55,923 --> 00:06:57,967
Because like he's the only character that

151
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,545
you actually get to know.

152
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,466
Everyone else just kind of like dies.

153
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,814
They get drunk and like
stab people, or they cry.

154
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:06,903
That's pretty much what
everybody else does,

155
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:09,713
and then Iago's the one
who like lets you in,

156
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,083
lets you know what he's thinking,

157
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,010
when he's bringing specific elements,

158
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,355
like with each person in the play,

159
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:17,398
he's different from each person,

160
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:22,135
and you can see that through the play.

161
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:23,482
- Well, as she was saying,

162
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:27,290
like how everyone else was
crying and like going crazy,

163
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,447
or like either having an awful
time or having a good time,

164
00:07:30,447 --> 00:07:32,607
like they still trust Iago,

165
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,602
even though he's standing
there not doing that with them.

166
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:41,151
I mean, just like the way he's able to

167
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,911
still convince them whenever he's not,

168
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:46,887
he doesn't seem like he's on the,

169
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:50,207
like he convinced them
that he's on their side,

170
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,784
but he's not actually
doing everything they are,

171
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:55,640
or he's not really doing
anything to show them

172
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:03,024
that's he's isn't feeling
what they're feeling. Alex?

173
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,802
- I have a quote, I guess.

174
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:12,943
It's at (mumbles) around there.

175
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,706
"And their palates both
for sweet and sour,

176
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:17,958
"as husbands have, what is it they do

177
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,908
"when they change us for others?

178
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:23,020
"Is it sport? I think it is.
And doth affection breed it?

179
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:30,148
"I think it doth. Is't frailty
that thus errs? It is so too.

180
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:34,420
"And have we not affections,
desires for sport, and frailty,

181
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,576
"as men have? Then let them
use us well, else let them know,

182
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:41,850
"the ills we do, their
ills instruct us so."

183
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,476
So it's kind of like talking about how

184
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:46,192
the men control the women,

185
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,464
and so I guess like that's
like the sexism of the day,

186
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:55,108
or like of that era, and like

187
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:57,871
this is Emilia, she's
talking to Desdemona,

188
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,447
and she's talking about
how like men control them,

189
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:05,557
and all their thoughts are
kind of implanted by the men,

190
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:08,784
like Emilia, like she got
the handkerchief because

191
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:12,499
her husband told her to do
that, and they're all just

192
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:16,238
really obedient and everything. Chloe?

193
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:19,837
- [Chloe] I mean, I think
that, yeah it has to do

194
00:09:19,837 --> 00:09:23,691
with the time period, as far
as the sexism in the play

195
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:25,873
or whatever, but I mean because

196
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:28,195
that it's just the way it
was, but I think that when

197
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:30,958
you look at the female characters
in the play, like Emilia,

198
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,813
she turns out to be one of the
most influential characters,

199
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:38,505
and she's the one that
takes down the bad person.

200
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:42,104
It's her that takes
down Iago, pretty much,

201
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:43,334
because she tells him the truth,

202
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,749
and then something that
none of the men could do,

203
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:47,862
or even question.

204
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:49,789
Then the other thing I would say is that

205
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,320
the women's loyalty to each other,

206
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,038
especially Desdemona to Emilia,

207
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:58,403
because it's back earlier in the play,

208
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,121
I don't actually have it, but Emilia,

209
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,210
I mean, Desdemona sings a
song earlier in the play,

210
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,694
something, "Willow, willow, willow,"

211
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,552
some more stuff about the song,

212
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:11,545
and then when Emilia's
dying, she sings a line

213
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,287
from that exact same song,

214
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:17,048
and she says, she references,
"my mistress death."

215
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,372
So I think a lot of it shows

216
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:24,176
how the women stick together.

217
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:27,497
- It's also kind of like,
I mean, I agree with you,

218
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:32,651
and I mean it's not
sexist, it looks at sexism,

219
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,904
because I mean you see how Desdemona

220
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:37,388
is the stereotypical woman of that time,

221
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:40,360
and she kind of does what
her husband tells her to,

222
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,800
she doesn't rebel against him,

223
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,609
she is completely loyal to him,

224
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:46,606
regardless of how he treats her.

225
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,044
I mean, he's hit her,
and she just accepts it.

226
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:50,437
Even when he kills her,

227
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:54,593
she takes the blame and
doesn't rat him out,

228
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:57,797
and it just kind of, you
have problems respecting her

229
00:10:57,797 --> 00:10:59,144
because of it.

230
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:00,630
Like I mean, she's a good character,

231
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,418
but you just can't, it's really hard to

232
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:04,276
respect someone who just accepts

233
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:08,083
everything that is done to her like that.

234
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,080
Then you have to juxtapose it with Emilia,

235
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,517
and she was a really
influential character,

236
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,281
and is able to rise above,

237
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,998
and kind of try to take
down her own husband

238
00:11:17,998 --> 00:11:20,877
and go against it.

239
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:22,688
It's kind of looking at
sexism and saying like,

240
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,916
you know, which is better for you?

241
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:30,792
Which do you like more?

242
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,527
Look at how the sexism
and the roles of women

243
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,362
has affected Desdemona,

244
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:40,539
and then how Emilia's been
able to rise above it.

245
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,538
- [Teacher] Can I jump in?

246
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:42,374
- Yeah.

247
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:43,744
- I definitely agree with you,

248
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,435
but my thoughts are also going
back to Act I, Scene III,

249
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,567
because I think at the
beginning of the play,

250
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,061
Desdemona is very much
not a stereotypical woman.

251
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:56,175
She has married the man she
loves, defying her father.

252
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,009
Knowing her dad wouldn't like it,

253
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,844
she ran off and married him anyway.

254
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,421
When Othello's talking
about how he won her heart,

255
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,975
it was by telling the stories of the wars,

256
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:05,654
and it's actually

257
00:12:05,654 --> 00:12:06,400
(cough)

258
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,995
very interesting, because it says that

259
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:11,384
Desdemona would seriously (mumbles).

260
00:12:11,384 --> 00:12:12,778
She would be very
interested in these stories,

261
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:16,678
even to the point where she
wished she had been born a man.

262
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:20,088
Then, when Othello says,
"I have to go to war,"

263
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,679
and the Duke says, "Let's like Desdemona

264
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:23,095
"stay at her dad's house,"

265
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:25,185
Desdemona says, "No, I married this man

266
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:28,529
"to be with him. Let me
go to the war, also."

267
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:33,126
So at least at that scene,
I think that she's a model

268
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:36,028
of a very, very active
woman who wants to go to war

269
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:37,282
with her husband, she wants to be

270
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:38,373
with her husband.

271
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,951
When Othello comes out
in Act II, Scene III

272
00:12:40,951 --> 00:12:43,551
to stop the fight between
Cassio and Roderigo,

273
00:12:43,551 --> 00:12:45,478
Desdemona comes out, too, and says,

274
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:47,429
"What's going on, what's wrong?"

275
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,913
And Othello says, "Come away
sweetie, let's go back to bed."

276
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:50,912
Right?

277
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:54,487
I certainly agree that there's a passivity

278
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:55,904
in Desdemona by the end,

279
00:12:55,904 --> 00:12:58,713
but I don't know if I see
that so much at the beginning.

280
00:12:58,713 --> 00:12:59,596
Go ahead.

281
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:00,869
- [Girl with scarf] I agree,
I think that like sometimes

282
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:02,889
Desdemona wants to be
the stereotypical woman,

283
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,612
and then like other times, she wants to be

284
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,525
the like "rebel," kind of,

285
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,336
because like Mr. Proctor said,

286
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:12,378
like she completely rebels against her dad

287
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:13,051
at the beginning,

288
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:15,371
and then also like, she's not

289
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,047
the stereotypical woman,
because like every single man

290
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,531
like in the play has admitted that

291
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,878
she's the most beautiful woman,

292
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:23,968
that they want her and all this stuff,

293
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:28,867
and so she has some power over them, too.

294
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,004
But yeah, I just think it's interesting

295
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:32,582
how like there are scenes where

296
00:13:32,582 --> 00:13:35,484
she's the complete like
stereotypical housewoman,

297
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:38,781
and then other times, she's
like completely passive.

298
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:40,430
- Even though it's been brought up

299
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,775
that she defied her
father to marry Othello,

300
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,749
she's still, I feel like she's still

301
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:48,139
very like part of that time period,

302
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:49,508
as far as the role of women,

303
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:51,366
because even though Othello wasn't

304
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,525
her perfect husband in
the eyes of her father,

305
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,104
she still jumped from the control

306
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:59,051
of one man, her father, to
another man, her husband.

307
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,443
So, Tanya?

308
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:03,556
- [Tanya] Okay, so about Desdemona,

309
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:06,783
I think that like even
though she did that stuff,

310
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:08,757
she still was a stereotypical woman.

311
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:13,145
Like we said before, those women,

312
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:16,094
they're supposed to be
obedient to their husbands,

313
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:18,788
so like whenever she
does kind of like rebel

314
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:20,204
and do something different from,

315
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:23,153
or like kind of jump in to the conver-

316
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,684
like Mr. Proctor was
saying, like those examples,

317
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:28,307
she's doing it for Othello.

318
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,513
She jumps in, like she
goes to war to be with him,

319
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:35,111
and then she comes in like
whenever he's in trouble.

320
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,363
And then, the thing about Emilia

321
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,522
is she's doing stuff for herself.

322
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:43,748
Like in Act IV, Scene III,

323
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:44,793
yeah, that's what we read,

324
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:47,324
she's talking about how it's just like,

325
00:14:47,324 --> 00:14:53,245
she would cheat on her husband once.

326
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:54,754
It's just like she says,

327
00:14:54,754 --> 00:14:56,286
"The world's a huge thing,

328
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,160
"it is a great price for a small vice."
