1
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:02,911
- So, these two are gonna combine

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:04,780
and make six X squared?

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,471
- Yes.

4
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,191
- Okay and then what about this guy?

5
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:08,863
- Just bring him down.

6
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:10,431
- Alright, what about her?

7
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:11,464
- You can bring her down.

8
00:00:11,464 --> 00:00:12,511
- Okay.

9
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,751
- That's a four X to the fourth,

10
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:14,751
not four X squared.

11
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:15,864
- Ah, thank you.

12
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:17,743
Four X to the fourth.

13
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:19,591
And is this term positive or negative?

14
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,751
- Positive.

15
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:21,531
- And what about this term?

16
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,531
- Positive.

17
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,051
And what do we call this guy?

18
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,881
[inaudible]

19
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:27,431
Rock on, okay good, good, good.

20
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:29,721
Alright, easy one, you ready?

21
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:35,671
Three X times X squared plus

22
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,710
four X minus two.

23
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,711
And this time

24
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:46,551
we're multiplying, what
kind of monomial is that?

25
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:47,792
- Linear.

26
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:48,865
- Linear, good.

27
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:52,104
Times a quadratic what?

28
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:53,031
- Trinomial.

29
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,101
- Trinomial, awesome.

30
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:57,100
Go ahead and distribute
that and see what you get.

31
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,831
When you think you have an answer

32
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,111
do you wanna show it to
the person next to you

33
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:10,710
and see if you agree or disagree

34
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,320
with each other?

35
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,441
Alright, alrighty. So.

36
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:39,711
Any exciting disagreements?

37
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:41,390
- No.

38
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,911
- Nothing.  No one differs
from anyone else?

39
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:45,630
- No.

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,471
- Larry Thayer.

41
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,871
- He just forgot to write
his [inaudible] down.

42
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,961
- Okay, but now you're cool?

43
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:54,271
So, everybody either feels
like they got the same thing

44
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,882
or they fixed what thought they had?

45
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,190
Alright, that's boring.

46
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,510
Okay, so what do get when
you your first product done?

47
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,470
- Three X cubed.

48
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,831
- Alright, and then?

49
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,251
- 12 X squared.

50
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:10,564
- And then?

51
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:11,793
- Six X.

52
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:12,990
- And then?

53
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,871
- Nothing, it's simplified.

54
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:16,871
- It's done? Okay.

55
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,585
So, we ended up with a cubic trinomial.

56
00:02:18,585 --> 00:02:19,871
Now, here's what I wanna show you.

57
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:23,104
Somethin' a little different,
because what's the,

58
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,030
raise your hand if you can
tell me the verb we did here.

59
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,613
- Cubic?

60
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,791
- We been talkin' the verb.

61
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,472
- Distributed?

62
00:02:30,472 --> 00:02:32,631
- We distributed
and we also what?

63
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,905
- Simplified.

64
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,801
- Which one's right?

65
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:38,791
They're both, we simplified
and we used distributing

66
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,311
in order to simplify.

67
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:44,275
Okay, so I'm gonna put a verb up here.

68
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,912
And I'll even put distribute because

69
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,472
that's specifically what we did.

70
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:49,591
Now, here's what I'm gonna do,

71
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:50,784
I'm gonna give you a different thing.

72
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:51,991
I'm gonna give you this.

73
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,831
I'm gonna give you

74
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:58,063
four A cubed

75
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:03,901
plus two A squared

76
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:08,564
minus 10 A.

77
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,027
And I'm gonna spice this
up just a little bit,

78
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,591
I'm sorry about that,
change that 10 A to a 40 A.

79
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,551
Alright.

80
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,151
- It's already simplified.

81
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,281
- It's already simplified, okay.

82
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,663
So, I can't give you simplify for a verb.

83
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:29,533
I'm gonna give you a different verb.

84
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:31,961
Now, there's a better word

85
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,121
than what I'm about to put up here.

86
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:35,201
This isn't really a math word,

87
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,301
we're gonna replace it with
a better one very shortly.

88
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:45,151
And here's a clue.

89
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:47,992
Undistributed.

90
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,461
How do you undistribute?

91
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,461
Let's shove this expression

92
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:01,771
that you said's already
simplified, in a time machine.

93
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,781
Imagine you got like a,
have you guys ever seen like

94
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,224
fast feed photography
where there's a seed?

95
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,912
And it's like they speed
up the footage

96
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:10,310
and you see the seed germinate

97
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,751
and you see the little stem grow,

98
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,801
and it's kind of all jerky
and everything.

99
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:15,550
Okay, can you imagine
playing that backwards

100
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,993
and you have a little sprout

101
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,951
and it goes back in and it
ends up as a little seed.

102
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:20,982
Right?

103
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:24,824
Imagine that this was on the page

104
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,474
as a final answer

105
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,891
and we put it in backwards

106
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:32,684
to see how it might have
started as a math problem.

107
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,772
- Do you use the [inaudible]?

108
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:35,991
- You can do that?

109
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:39,700
- Do you use like the factor tree?

110
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,823
- Say that a little louder, Alec.

111
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,971
- Do you use the factor trees?

112
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,750
- Alec, that's interesting
that you asked.

113
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,303
Alec is asking about our
warm-up problem today,

114
00:04:49,303 --> 00:04:51,511
which was a throw-back to when you guys

115
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:52,590
were in elementary school

116
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,192
and you talked about
things called factor trees.

117
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,703
And with factor trees we talk about

118
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,990
how you can take a number
and use a sledgehammer

119
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,870
and kind of bust it up
[claps hands] into it's what?

120
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,984
- To it's factors.

121
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:04,511
- To its factors and we keep goin'

122
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,291
until we can't do it anymore, right?

123
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,101
Huh.

124
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,070
- The deal with that is
you have to figure out

125
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,152
what was originally inside and
outside of the parentheses.

126
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:18,640
You just gotta kinda
ignore the A, I guess.

127
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,872
- Even ignoring the A like,

128
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,110
I don't know if putting
it in a facts tree

129
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,531
you really put it into parentheses.

130
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:31,720
'Cause you don't really have a
whole lot to work with there,

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,311
to put it back into
parentheses, I don't know.

132
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:37,230
It's kinda going against
every fiber of my being and--

133
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,230
- [laughs] Like why would you

134
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,751
make a math problem out of
a perfectly nice number?

135
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:42,591
- Yeah.

136
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,911
- Okay, that's interesting,

137
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:46,591
we'll come back to that cuz
that's a really good point.

138
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:49,721
Why would you take like a 12

139
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:52,611
and turn it into a math
problem, what good does that do?

140
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,031
Yeah, what good is that?

141
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:56,031
We'll come back to that,
that's an excellent question.

142
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,311
With big answers.

143
00:05:57,311 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes sir, what do you think?

144
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,520
- I forgot what I was gonna say.

145
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,592
- Ya sure?

146
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:05,461
Lauren, what d'ya think?

147
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:08,271
- Isn't this
kinda like checking it?

148
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,470
- Lauren just said something interesting.

149
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,081
She said "Isn't it
kinda like checking it?"

150
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,251
So, when you check an equation
for example, what do you do?

151
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,707
- Put it back in [inaudible].

152
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:19,991
- So, when you solve an equation,

153
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:23,621
it's kinda like tying a knot.

154
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:25,671
And then when you put it
in, put in the solution

155
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,271
and you check it it's kinda like

156
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:29,591
untying the knot to see
if comes out the same way.

157
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:30,992
- But we don't have an equation

158
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,150
to plug those into.

159
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,711
- You're right.

160
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,830
Carolyn, what were you gonna say?

161
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,471
- Okay, so you know how yesterday,

162
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,701
I know this is kind of off subject but I--

163
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:39,991
- That's okay.

164
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,111
- You know how yesterday like
you showed us this problem

165
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,870
on our worksheet and it was like

166
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,511
three times the binomial or whatever?

167
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,981
When you said we were
gonna do those today?

168
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,550
- Can you be specific with the problem

169
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,741
so I know what exactly.

170
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,743
- It was number 50 on--

171
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,750
- Oh, oh you mean the problems

172
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,510
that look like this.

173
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,391
- Yeah. the ones that we said

174
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:01,991
we've already done
but we really haven't.

175
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:04,150
- Like this?

176
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,303
And you guys wanted to make this,

177
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,911
what did you wanna make this?

178
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:11,660
[Inaudible]

179
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,870
X squared, oh it feels
so right, doesn't it?

180
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,150
We'll come back to that in a second.

181
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,311
That is sort of related to this.

182
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,230
What were you gonna say Zach

183
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,790
and then we'll take a closer look.

184
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,867
- I was just gonna say,

185
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,270
couldn't there be different,

186
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,790
like when you unsimplify that,

187
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,591
couldn't there be different answers?

188
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:31,140
Or is there only one correct answer?

189
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:36,343
- Can someone
restate what he's sayin' here?

190
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:38,711
Or what do you think he means by that?

191
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:40,111
Sam, what do you think he means by that?

192
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,623
- I think he means that
when like you unsimplify it

193
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,425
it can be with the two parentheses

194
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,391
or it can be with one parentheses

195
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:49,390
and the term in front of it.

196
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,671
- So, you're sayin' maybe

197
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,181
it's like this and there's
something here.

198
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:59,801
Or maybe, it's like this?
- Yeah.

199
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,551
- 'Cause this looks, I'll tell you,

200
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:05,910
this looks an awful lot
like the answer we got here.

201
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,750
And this didn't start off with a number

202
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,551
that was distributed
necessarily like this one.

203
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,071
It started off like this, didn't it?

204
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,791
- How do you figure out how

205
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,590
to throw it backwards?

206
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,190
'Cause that's just like...

207
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,091
- You know what,

208
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:21,971
let's start with the easier one.

209
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:23,511
Which one of those is less complicated,

210
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,671
the blue one or the orange one?

211
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,911
- The blue one.

212
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,941
- I'd agree, let's start with this way

213
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,271
and then maybe we can
go up to the orange.

214
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,545
So if I wanted to, again
this is not a math term,

215
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,351
we're gonna use a better
term in a little bit.

216
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:36,784
If I were to quote undistribute,

217
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:39,751
or use a vacuum cleaner
to suck something out

218
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,581
of all three of these terms,

219
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:43,590
would you agree that it
has to be the same thing

220
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,431
that we suck out of each one?

221
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:46,872
In other words, can I
pull a four out of this

222
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,780
and an eight out of this?
- yeah.

223
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,830
- Okay.  Any suggestions?

224
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,171
Let's just focus on the coefficients,

225
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,911
any suggestions on what I can pull out?

226
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:54,951
- A two.

227
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,791
- A two, okay.

228
00:08:58,691 --> 00:08:59,620
Anything else?

229
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,750
- Four?

230
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,551
- Can I pull a four, let's go door to door.

231
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,671
Can he give me a four?

232
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,721
Can he give me a four?

233
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,191
Can she?

234
00:09:10,191 --> 00:09:11,871
So, if there was a four out there

235
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:13,911
I would have to think what was in there

236
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:16,150
to distribute a four two to make two.

237
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,691
I'm gonna avoid fractions here.

238
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,570
- Yeah see, he's avoiding fractions.

239
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,223
- I could,

240
00:09:21,223 --> 00:09:23,230
I could technically pull out anything.

241
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,872
But with the factor tree we
did at the beginning of class,

242
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,310
typically when you talk
about, that's a good point.

243
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,951
When we talk about factors
we stick with whole numbers.

244
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,151
Okay?

245
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,271
Or maybe even integers,

246
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,523
but we usually don't go into fractions.

247
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,110
Sam, what're you thinkin'?

248
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,647
- To unsimplify it,

249
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,390
couldn't you put in one of those boxes

250
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,351
that we did yesterday for the terms?

251
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:47,220
Like put it in the middle
and then find

252
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,051
what it is?
- Oh yeah.

253
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:50,672
- Why, you're talkin'

254
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:52,471
when we were doing

255
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:53,730

And then ask ourselves

259
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:03,831
what would go here, that's
a weird question mark.

and what would go there?

That's interesting.

Alec, what are you thinking?

263
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,360
- Couldn't you take
out an A with that two?

264
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,951
Like on the problem?

265
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,331
- Since it all has A's?

266
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,831
If you can take out a,
can you put out an A,

267
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,951
like you took out the two?

- Yes.

- She give up an A?
- Yes.

274

- Well, let's try that, let's
try that, that's interesting.

275
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,691
So if I were to quote, and again,

276
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:48,720
we're not gonna use this
word much after the next.

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,391
Would you, if you were
to quote undistribute

278
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:53,010
a two A from four A cubed,

279
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,801
what would that look like?

280
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:55,580
What would have to be here?

281
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,304
- It would have to be a two A squared.

282
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,191
- Well okay, let's keep goin'

283
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,311
and then we'll check to
see if this makes sense.

284

I'll get your question
in one second, Caroline.

285
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,591
So then what would be next?

[Background Chatter]

287
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,511
So, the two from the two
would leave a ghost one.

288
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:16,090
And then the A from the A
squared would be a what, Oscar?

289
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,351
- I was thinkin' one A.

290
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,112
- One A, alright I'd like that.

291
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,312
And then the two A from
the negative 40 A

292
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:22,183
would be a what?

293
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,071
- Negative 20.

294
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:25,071
- Negative 20 A?

So, now we're back to
what Justin said.

297
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:38,271
We've taken a perfectly
nice, simplified polynomial

298
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:42,251
and turned it into a math problem.

299
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:44,551
Let's see if this is even right.

300
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,911
What do you think we could
do to check ourselves

301
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:47,430
like Lauren suggested?

302
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,712
- Do the problem.

303
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:50,591
- What do you mean do the problem?

304
00:11:50,591 --> 00:11:51,471
- Simplified.

305
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:53,424
- Okay, so let's simplify it real quick.

306
00:11:53,424 --> 00:11:56,570
What's two A times two A,
and no peeking?

307
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,303
- Four A squared.

308
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,951
- What's two A times two A cubed,

309
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:01,991
I mean squared?

310
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,991
Four A cubed, good.

311
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,670
And what's two A times A?

312
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,431
- That's two A squared.

313
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:08,351
- What kind?

314
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,912
Positive two A squared.

315
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,711
And two A times negative 20?

316
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,150
- Negative 40 A.

317
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,272
- Oh, it worked!

318
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,831
- Yeah. [clapping]

- Yes, ma'am.

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,472
- Holy Cow!
- Whoa!

330
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:40,581
- Do you guys know where to start?
No, I don't know.

331
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:41,951
But, check this out.

332
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,792
Didn't you just say we
could take this and turn it?

333
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,033
That's the same thing we had, right?

334
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,230
So, can I factor that and turn that into

335
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,181
two A times two A squared

336
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,911
plus A minus 20?

337
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,511
Are you cool with that?

338
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:59,152
Are you okay if I just
leave the bottom?

339
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:03,163
Two A squared plus A minus 20.

340
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:08,230
Anybody have an idea
what might happen now?

341
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,786
[Background Chatter]

342
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,102
Did you guys know that
you've been doin' that

343
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:20,352
since the fourth grade?

344
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,230
- No.

345
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,822
- Yes, you have.

346
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:25,431
Just with much less obnoxious numbers.

347
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:29,270
What does 16/32,

348
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,070
what does that, let me use another.

349
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,361
What does that simplify to?

350
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:36,651
Here's why, you guys
probably already knew this.

351
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:40,651
Let's leave the 16 alone,
and isn't 32 two times 16?

352
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:44,543
- Yeah. Ohhh!

353
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:46,144
- That's the math.

354
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:49,030
That's the math that justifies
simplifying fractions

355
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,041
like you've been doin' since
you were like eight years old.

356
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,265
- That's cool.

357
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:57,030
- What other occasion,
this is gonna be helpful.

358
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,751
How do you undo plus or adding

359
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,032
when you're solving equations?

360
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:02,220
- Subtraction.

361
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,385
- Subtraction, you call in
the opposite, right?

362
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,261
How do you undo multiplication?

363
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:08,230
- You divide.

364
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,981
- Divide, well here's what
we're leading up to.

365
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:18,081
How are you gonna undo the squared?

366
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:22,263
Factoring busts up the squared for us.

367
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:24,751
And it's gonna be a very important tool

368
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:26,943
when we're solving,
what kind of equations

369
00:14:26,943 --> 00:14:29,190
do you think we can call these?

370
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,181
[Background Chatter]

371
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,100
Think about it.

372
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,985
Look at the degree.

373
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:38,901
- Oh, quadratic.

374
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,972
- Quadratic equations.

375
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:45,112
[Background Chatter]

376
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:47,350
Alright, let's take a look
at another one.

377
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,751
Let me have you
undistribute one again.

378
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:52,471
We need a better word for this.

379
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:56,252
Did we call this unmulltiplying?

380
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:56,891
- No.

381
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:58,271
- What did we call the verb here,

382
00:14:58,271 --> 00:14:59,551
what was the verb on this?

383
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:00,120
- Division?
