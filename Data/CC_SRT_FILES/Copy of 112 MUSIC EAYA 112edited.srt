1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,886
(papers rustling)

2
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:13,748
- [Teacher] who's done writing?

3
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:25,616
Okay. Alright.

4
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:29,029
Ok, couple of goals for this piece today.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,039
Here's where we're at here.

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,162
One, clearly get the
notes and rhythms down,

7
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:36,248
because this Comstock piece, ok,

8
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:38,920
and so is the second Middleston
piece, three, the primo.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,358
So we'll do both those today,
wanna get the notes learned,

10
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:42,775
the notes and rhythms learned,

11
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:45,840
but I also want to treat
this piece today as though

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,599
it were a sight reading piece,

13
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,489
just like if we were getting
ready for contest in March,

14
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,622
do one of those little example
pieces for sight singing.

15
00:00:55,622 --> 00:01:00,852
So we'll treat this in
the same manner as that.

16
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:06,063
Then I wanted to also, as
we're reading the piece,

17
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:09,232
take a look at how the
structure of the piece

18
00:01:09,232 --> 00:01:13,308
can inform how we might
go about learning it.

19
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:15,142
You'll see some things here in a minute.

20
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:20,599
Alright, so, if we take
a look at the piece

21
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,410
and we've already written solfège in.

22
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,562
We take a look at the piece,

23
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:25,382
what markings on the score can you see

24
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:31,040
that might jump out at you
that might be different?

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,115
[inaudible]

26
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:33,781
Repeats, okay, even before that,

27
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:34,878
like right up by the title.

28
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:35,691
- [Student] Canon.

29
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:36,805
- [Teacher] Canon, what's that mean?

30
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,034
(students talking over each other)

31
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,335
The canon, okay, what's a canon?

32
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:41,428
- [Female Student] It's a round.

33
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:42,545
- [Teacher] It's a round, right,

34
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:43,623
so you have one set of music,

35
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:46,947
and then the same set of
music follows it later, right?

36
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:48,980
We do that in warm ups, okay.

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,268
Alright, so a canon.

38
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:53,792
So you think soprano
and alto are in canon?

39
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:56,745
- [Male Student] It'd
probably be women and men.

40
00:01:56,745 --> 00:02:00,758
- [Teacher] Probably women and
men, good, good observation.

41
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:03,638
So we look at the structure,

42
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:07,524
where might that canon begin?

43
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:09,420
(students speaking)

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,146
After a P at the bottom of the page, okay.

45
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:15,395
So pick up to measure 11, alright.

46
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:19,313
Okay, so what kind of material
do the guys have there?

47
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,502
- [Male Student] It says we
mix with the women's structure.

48
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:25,305
- [Teacher] Exactly, that same
material that the girls do.

49
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:28,311
So in our rehearsal,

50
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:31,261
noting that this is a canon,

51
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,677
at least to that point,

52
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:35,108
how might we rehearse this or set it up

53
00:02:35,108 --> 00:02:38,289
so we can have success right away?

54
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,176
- [Female Student] Girls and
guys sing their parts together.

55
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,778
- [Teacher] Girls and guys
sing their parts together,

56
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:46,030
good, easy.

57
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,685
So if we do that, then
what might something else

58
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:53,970
be helpful for us to do?

59
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,127
We're singing parts together...

60
00:02:58,127 --> 00:03:01,283
maybe pair up?

61
00:03:01,283 --> 00:03:03,293
Typically we get together and we chant,

62
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:04,628
so let's do that first.

63
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:06,553
Let's do the chanting just
like we do for sight singing,

64
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,884
so you can practice that.

65
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:11,251
Okay, so what are our pairs gonna be?

66
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:14,919
Soprano and tenor, so you have to move,

67
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,320
and bass and alto.

68
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,146
So starting at solfège, girls
you start at the beginning,

69
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,392
guys you simply start at measure...

70
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:30,257
pick up at measure 11,
okay? Go on and move.

71
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:34,959
Yes, circle up right here.

72
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,161
Alright, who's gonna be our leader?

73
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:42,776
(chairs moving, students talking)

74
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,004
Who wants to start us off?

75
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,217
- [Female Student] Alena?

76
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,521
- [Teacher] Alena? Okay,
you can start us off.

77
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:50,545
(students talking)

78
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:54,091
Who's going to start the...
you. Okay, there you go.

79
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,403
Okay, good, go for it. Chant it, quickly.

80
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,918
- [Female Student] Let's
start at the beginning,

81
00:03:57,918 --> 00:04:00,548
we are on the pick up to 4.

82
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:03,699
So 1, 2, 3, and 4.

83
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:09,022
♫ So so mi fa so do re mi ♫

84
00:04:09,022 --> 00:04:40,607
(students singing in a round)

85
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:42,271
- [Teacher] Okay so now
we got to the end of that,

86
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:44,467
go to measure 11 for the girls,

87
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:49,330
and measure 21 for the guys.

88
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,383
Go right there and start it again.

89
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,529
So now girls you go measure 11,

90
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,783
which is right where you finished,

91
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,228
and guys go to 21.

92
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:02,109
Same thing here that's
a little bit different.

93
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:06,714
(students talking)

94
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,928
- [Female Student] Alright, 1 and 2.

95
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:57,410
(students singing)

96
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,816
(students and teacher talking
while others are singing)

97
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:06,939
- [Teacher] Let's all
chant together in rhythm.

98
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,090
Stay in your groups.

99
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,074
Stay in your groups please,

100
00:06:10,074 --> 00:06:12,299
but we're gonna start with
the sopranos and altos,

101
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,524
and then we'll pick up with the guys

102
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:14,729
at the bottom of the page.

103
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:15,967
So start at the beginning everybody.

104
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,730
1, 2, and ready, and go.

105
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,832
(students singing, teacher
snapping to rhythm)

106
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:51,865
Stop, okay, now guys
you're gonna pick up there,

107
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:53,903
and girls, you're gonna
come in 2 beats later.

108
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:56,548
Here we go, ready and go.

109
00:06:56,548 --> 00:08:03,137
(students singing)

110
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,946
Okay, go right on the coda please.

111
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,262
So we would've done the repeat,

112
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:07,609
now we go back here.

113
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,025
Go right on the coda please,

114
00:08:09,025 --> 00:08:11,414
right after the double bar, ready, and go.

115
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:19,168
(students singing)

116
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:23,096
3, 4, fermata... cut off please.

117
00:08:23,096 --> 00:08:24,455
Sopranos, ready, and go.

118
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:30,602
(students singing)

119
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:31,934
Bass.

120
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:37,261
(students singing)

121
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:39,183
Okay, pretty good,
we'll come back to that.

122
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,831
That takes a little bit of
fordating when you get together.

123
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:44,197
Okay, go back to sections,

124
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:46,826
let's do right in the... not
your traditional sections.

125
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,635
Let's keep the basses over
here, altos over here,

126
00:08:49,635 --> 00:08:51,400
tenors and sopranos over here.

127
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:58,508
So do two rows, back in your sections.

128
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,594
Okay, so we're gonna do
just like we chanted,

129
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:01,680
we're gonna partner up,

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,570
and we're gonna sing it at the same time.

131
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,261
Okay, at the same time.

132
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,026
So guys, you're starting in measure 11.

133
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:15,886
Girls, you're starting
in measure pick up to 1.

134
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:17,402
Ready, and

135
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:24,617

♫ Do do do do do ♫

00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,935
okay, tenors and

140
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,482

00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:40,093
Basses, okay let's sing
all at the same time

142
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:43,462
right where your canon,
first name of the canon is.

143
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:48,175
Here we go, 1, 2, and ready, and sing.

144
00:09:48,175 --> 00:10:27,012

00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:29,884
Okay sopranos, sorry, altos and basses,

00:10:37,314 --> 00:11:08,799
(students singing)

150
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:11,051
Okay, go back to the do.

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,928
Do that again, same spot, 1, 2.

156
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:37,288
(students singing)

157
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,309
Okay good, excellent
reading, good for you.

158
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,984
Now putting it together.

159
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,075
Canon, lots of people think

160
00:11:44,075 --> 00:11:46,064
"oh canons are easy, no
problem, it's the same thing."

161
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:48,482
Except canons tend to be
tricky, we'll see how it goes.

162
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:50,493
Here we go, soprano and alto first.

163
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:55,313
♫ Do mi so mi do ♫

164
00:11:55,313 --> 00:11:57,775
Sing your first notes girls, ready, and

165
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:01,675
(female students singing)

166
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:05,432
Here we go, 1, 2, and ready and go

167
00:12:05,432 --> 00:13:57,190
(students singing)

168
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,606
Okay good, I was gonna
stop you before then,

169
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,696
but you did so well, so we kept singing.

170
00:14:00,696 --> 00:14:01,671
Good for you.

171
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:03,684
Okay, so what happens at 21 for the girls?

172
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:07,522
Well not, sorry, measure 11 for the girls?

173
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:10,285
(student speaking inaudibly)

174
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:13,552
Does what, something different,
so what would we call it?

175
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,205
B, or the counter melody of this. Okay.

176
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:20,688
So it's kind of the same shape,

177
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:25,842
but it starts on what
pitch class instead of do?

178
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:29,255
No, sorry, what did we first
start at the beginning?

179
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:32,390
So and mi, and this starts on do.

180
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,853
So different pitch class, same shape,

181
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:37,793
but it's singing the fifth
lower, okay, for soprano.

182
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,331
Okay good, let me hear the guys please.

183
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:43,244
You did really well until
we got to the B section.

184
00:14:43,244 --> 00:14:47,157
Let me hear, actually let's
hear everybody do the B section.

185
00:14:47,157 --> 00:14:48,527
So guys, you're gonna start at 21,

186
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:51,476
girls, you're gonna start at 11.

187
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,530
Basses, it's just...

188
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,398
No it's not, it's not different at all.

189
00:14:56,398 --> 00:14:58,309
♫ Do here is do ♫

190
00:14:58,309 --> 00:14:59,286
Find your first pitch.
