 What do you think it is going to be this time? I think it's going to be like negative 57, 59.
 Maybe like 54 or something.
 Colder or hotter. You don't need to touch...
 You don't need to touch it. You and your temperature. (multiple voices talking at once)
 [Voiceover] I got a (mumbles) playing with your (mumbles).
 Go down.
 [Voiceover] The temperature is going to go down with the ice.
 It was 22.
 [Voiceover] 22, no not 22.
 [Voiceover] You think (mumbles) ice the temperature is going to go down? (multiple voices talking at once)
 The water went up.
 It's your choice how much of anything you put in. (multiple voices talking at once)
 Should we put a lot?
 A little more.
 A little more.
 Why don't you dump it into (mumbles)?
 Not the whole thing.
 Yeah. Oh! (multiple voices talking at once)
 [Voiceover] Don't put it all in like that. There's hardly any room.
 Ready?
 Go. (multiple voices talking at once)
 Science is kind of messy, isn't it? It's okay. Just put it back in there and work together.
 Tell me when to go.
 Ready?
 Ready and start.
 What do you think? I think it's going to be like maybe 20 degrees.
 Or maybe negative 10.
 We'll just have to see. (multiple voices talking at once)
 40, Jacob, 40.
 [Voiceover] No, it's 50. 40.
 50 degrees, it's almost.
 It's 50 degrees, Jake. It's 50 degrees. It's 50 degrees, Jake. What's he doing.
 [Voiceover] So where's the line? Try to put one in.
 Oh, so now you get it?
 Where's the line?
 [Voiceover] And it's 40.
 40, comes out like 44.
 [Voiceover] What's the temperature?
 It changed.
 44. It says 40.
 [Voiceover] No, it's 44.
 Jacob, it doesn't matter.
 [Voiceover] What are you having a dispute about here. (mumbles) get out now.
 It was right here.
 So it's on.
 It's not even gone down.
 And now it went up to what? Well, a little higher than that. Yours went up, so what did, how do you know, Jacob, by looking at the thermometer, how it went up or down? Explain to me.
 I know how it went up because I see, because if you turn your head away and then you look at it, it went up.
 You think so? How do you read this, though? (multiple voices talking at once)
 Are they? There's five lines right, let's see, but how do you break it up so you can read it to get from 70 to 80? How do you break that up, Jacob, do you know?
 Um.
 Right, you count by twos. Okay, you guys get busy, I'm interrupting your experimental time, you're scientists here. (multiple voices talking at once)
 [Voiceover] Down, all the way down.
 [Voiceover] Just color it up to 50.
 [Voiceover] Down 30. I wonder what was in it.
 I think it's salt.
 I don't think it's salt.
 Last time I used, last time I used it it went down, and then it went down even more. (multiple voices talking at once)
 That's what I told you.
 It's floating.
 I'm breathing in good water. Water.
 What happened? (multiple voices talking at once)
 Use the thermometer. Ready, set, go. (mumbles) one more. (multiple voices talking at once)
 I think it's going to get colder, and (mumbles). I think it's going to get (mumbles).
 I think it's going to get negative 10.
 What do you think, Emily?
 [Voiceover] Zero degrees. (multiple voices talking at once)
 [Voiceover] Maybe negative zero.
 I'm not sure there is a negative zero.
 It's like frost all over it.
 Cold.
 Frost right here.
 Whatever was in it makes it go down.
 Temperature go down, makes frost. (multiple voices talking at once)
 Mystery (mumbles) is salt. The mystery grain is salt. The mystery grain is salt, it's melting the ice.
 [Voiceover] And it's condensing on the outside.
 [Voiceover] Ready guys?
 [Voiceover] Five, four.
 [Voiceover] What do you guys think it is? What do you think the temperature's going to be this time?
 I don't know.
 Lower than 50.
 555 degrees?
 That would be toasty. Got to be lower.
 [Voiceover] One, two, three, four, five. I see that most of you have finished your experiment. I would like to call and see. I'm going to get some questions.
 Take it out.
 Okay, eight. I have questions. Teagan, your group needs to come to me, please. Thank you, very good. Jacob, what did you notice between the base temperature and the first time when you put the water in, what happened?
 I noticed that when the base temperature, when we put in the base temperature, it was only water, it only changed by one degree.
 [Voiceover] It only changed by one degree. Very good. Number nine, who's number nine? Kayla, Kayla. What did you guys notice about the temperature?
 We...
 [Voiceover] What happened to it, what happened to the temperature?
 It went down.
 [Voiceover] It went down. What happened to your can, who knows? Think about that, take a minute with your group, I want you to talk about what's happening to your can, and why. (multiple voices talking at once)
 [Voiceover] So maybe it got frost for (mumbles).
 They get more frost on it. When I put, and it got yellow. The water was clear and then it got yellow when we put salt in.
 [Voiceover] It got dirty. _ [Voiceover] It looks like lemonade.
 It's all mushy.
 The (mumbles) stuff is looking to the ice that--
 And making it squishy.
 [Voiceover] Okay, one, two, three, four, five, come back to me for a minute. I pulled number five. Number five, what is happening to your can?
 It's getting frost on it.
 [Voiceover] It's getting frost on it. Why do you think it's getting frost? What did your group think that it was getting frost on it from?
 The ice and the mystery ingredient.
 [Voiceover] The mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty. What did we learn about, with the weather cycle, we talked about that, what's really happening? Talk in your group, is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost? Talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what's coming that's making the stuff on the outside of the can. (multiple voices talking at once)
 There is water on the side of the can.
 Maybe the mystery thing...
 [Voiceover] Making condensation on the can? And because I learned a lot about that--
 I think the mystery one and the ice did it together.
 That could be.
 Yeah, that could be.
 And combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can.
 [Voiceover] I think that the water, the mystery ingredient, (mumbles).
 [Voiceover] Okay, one, two, three, four, five. Number three, what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff, what's that wet stuff called? Ella.
 Condensation.
 [Voiceover] It's called condensation. What do you, why is that happening to your can? Number three, that's you right Luke? Okay, what's happening?
 Because it's like evaporating, and when it touches the cold can, then it turns back into cold water.
 [Voiceover] What's evaporating? Stop, don't answer that. Think in your group, what, he said it's evaporating, and then it's touching the can. What's touching the can? Talk in your group, figure out if you can figure out what's coming to touch your can.
 So well really it (mumbles) can.
 Yeah, it's kind of melting, so the water is on the can...
 So it's the mushy, icky...
 I know whatever mystery stuff.
 [Voiceover] Now I'll take it. It makes me, and then it makes water, water, water. Everything, you know, water.
 [Voiceover] How will Eve's last question?
 [Voiceover] Nope, we're just asking questions right this second. You guys need to wait, then we're gonna (mumbles). One, two, three, four, five, come back to me. Number 19, who's 19?
 Ella.
 [Voiceover] Okay, Ella. What is happening to make that can wet on the outside?
 The water and the ice, well the water tries to evaporate, but since there's ice at the top, it hits the ice, and then it comes back down. But then it gets on the can.
 [Voiceover] So the water, you think the water, in the, the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that, hit the ice. Good thought, let's keep going, let's see if we can get some more. Who is number 12?
 [Voiceover] Hayden.
 [Voiceover] Hayden's not here, so let's move on and let's find number nine. Who's number nine?
 Kayla.
 Kayla. Kayla, what's happening to your can, what's happening to it and why?
 It frosting.
 [Voiceover] It's frosting.
