 [Instructor] Clipart. Okay. You show me ... well, if we wanted to insert a Clipart picture, where do you think would be the best place to go? Click on insert. And then where is Clipart? Here you go. And I bet you we're going to find some really cool spider pictures. Click on spi-- type in spiders and see what you come up with. Hold on, I'll be right over. Yes. Wow, look at all those spiders. You have tons. Oh, your project's gonna be neat 'cause you have all kinds of neat pictures.
 Um... I think something in our computer is off.
 Okay. Let's turn this off. These computers sometimes get a little fussy and it's making bad choices.
 When I get 'em, I just keep pressing enter.
 Well, it's sort of like hitting an elevator button. But you can't really make it go any faster, but you feel a little better about click, click, click, click, click. So, go ahead and look over here. Hopefully that will come up a little faster. Sometimes it just is a little slow. Start with... there you go. You know what to do.
 Okay, there's a big picture.
 That's a huge picture. That's a neat spider. I think that'll be a neat one for your... for your project. Yeah.
 Okay. Um well, when we... when we clicked on the... uh... and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before...
 Yeah. We did want to do that.
 We did? And we clicked no.
 Okay. So that's probably why. Okay. So let's go onto Clipart office online and you're going to be able to find some really neat pictures here, too. This is the same thing. Type in squirrel. Let's see what we find. Make sure you spell it correctly.
 Q-U-I-R-R-E.
 It's a hard word.
 I-R-R-E.
 And then the color.
 Can I put S?
 Doesn't matter.
 Hit scroll or anything.
 Okay. And see what you can find. Look at all those squirrels.
 You should pick that one, a moving one?
 Yeah.
 Okay. So, you copy it to your clipboard. Now here's the problem. You need to accept the service agreement and you'll have to do it again. Yes. Okay. Now, click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard.
 Three times.
 I... I know. Did you copy it to the clipboard? Did you click on it? Okay. Then go back to PowerPoint. Let's see if it works.
 Uh.
 You know how to copy and paste things, so go ahead and paste it in there.
 [together] Yay.
 He'll move, but not right now. When you go to... make him a little bigger, though, I would say.
 Make him fat.
 Now, you can check to see how he's doing. If you wanna go to your slideshow... and from the beginning and see if he'll move for you. There he goes.
 [together] Yay.
 See? Now you know he worked.
 Yay.
 Good job.
