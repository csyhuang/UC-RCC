 And why face changes are different at different pressures. And so I think that at a certain pressure, they're so close together that they aren't a gas anymore and they become a liquid.
 Cool.
 Because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or, the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out. And the liquids can still move freely, but they're more close together, so.
 Okay.
 We thought that in a liquid, they can't move as freely as it can in gas.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well, another gas has to expand, well it does expand to fill its container.
 Yeah. So does that have anything to do with how they move?
 Well, you said that some, tried to, sometimes they don't always expand as much as they can, but I think they do. My guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is 'cause you think of pressed gas.
 What are you guys all thinking about of what you're hearing?
 Well...
 Do things sound reasonable?
 Yeah.
 Is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more? Just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas? At what point does that matter or not matter?
 Uh-huh.
 Okay. [students laugh] We're gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into.
