 [Boy in white] More important, 'cause  their friend Maser-- [sic] something died the day before, and they stayed in the village for that long. They didn't have to stay, but they decided to stay. They didn't have to do that, but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important.
 [Teacher] Well, and it may have been a choice for safety also, if they stay with him. If they run to another village, they may be, you know, picked off.
 [Girl in striped shirt] Trying to stick  to the customs that they are so used to, like back in normal life, and stuff like that. So, trying to get back in that. But, the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life, like their parents, and stuff.
 [Teacher] But saved their lives.
 [Girl in striped shirt] Yeah. Okay. Emily and Simon. Simon?
 [Teacher] Emily.
 [Girl in striped shirt] Emily and Spencer, I mean.
 [Boy in yellow] Simon? (laughs)
 [Girl in striped shirt] That's her last name.
 [Boy in white] Do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village, and blaming him for missing?
 [Girl in blue] I think anyone would get mad. They need to get it out on someone.
 [Boy in yellow] What do you mean by being right to get mad?
 [Boy in white] Do they have, like...
 [Boy in yellow] A valid purpose?
 [Boy in white] A valid reason for getting mad.
 [Boy in yellow] I mean, yeah.
 [Girl in blue] They were probably just mad out of frustration.
 [Boy in yellow] If you would have went in with them before, like earlier, before the rebels attacked, they wouldn't have been able to see their families. So, that's what their drive has been for the past couple months, or however long they've been running. It's to get back to their families. Even if they would have died, I mean. That's what he was saying, is that he was mad at him, at Dishmrael [sic] for holding him back, because he could have seen his family,
 [Boy in white] He would have died.
 [Boy in yellow] But then, later on  when his mind cooled down, he was like, yeah well, he saved my life, 'cause I would have been killed.
 [Boy in white] It was probably  like an in-the-moment thing.
 [Girl in blue] I think in that  kind of situation, you always look for someone to blame.
 [Girl in striped shirt] 'Cause there is  no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them, so we should hurry, and go see them. He thought they had time to go and see their family. Like, let's stop and rest, and stuff like that. There's no way he could have known that was gonna happen, so they can't really blame him, but they need to blame someone.
 [Girl in blue] Yeah.
 [Girl in striped shirt] I'd want  to punch someone too.
 [Girl in blue] I'd be so mad if  that happened to me. I understand why they would blame him, but looking back on it...
 [Teacher] And how does his age impact that, also?
 [Girl in blue] Well he's not...
 [Boy in white] He' not really  old enough to really think about it.
 [Girl in blue] All he's thinking about is his family.
 [Girl in dark hoodie] With maturity,  you think before you act, but as a little kid, you just act, and don't know the consequences.
 [Teacher] Well, and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all. There's another aspect.
 [Girl in striped shirt] And he used to  follow Junior, and everything he did, but now that Junior's gone, he doesn't even have that.
 [Teacher] Right. Exactly. Okay, keep going.
 [Boy in yellow] War is hell.
 [Boy in black] Oh yeah, you can...  Sorry about that.
 [Teacher] It's okay.
 [Boy in black] So, want to go, Kaylee?
 [Kaylee] Okay.
 [Boy in gray] Ask the question.
 [Kaylee] The question: Girda is a young woman at the time of the book, and so was Valentino and Wutuzuwut [sic]. How do they change through the course of the book, due to the tragic events in their lives.
 [Boy in black] I think they're  forced to grow up real fast, because of all the pressures. At the time, I mean, Valentino doesn't know his age, but let's say, like 15 and 20; and when, I haven't read the end of this book, but she comes home to America, and so does Valentino, and they just come over; and even though they're like like a 40-year-old. So, it's kinda weird coming back to America, and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures.
 [Boy in gray] Yeah, the whole event  just kinda makes them, you know, kinda step it up a bit. If something like this happens to you, you don't easily forget it. It becomes more of a part of you. It kinda takes out who you really are inside.
 [Kaylee] Yeah, it shapes you.
 [Boy in gray] Yeah.
 [Teacher] Well, and how did the stages in their life coincide. That's a good question, Kaylee.
 [Kaylee] Well, first of all, genocide, I thought, was basically, kind of done the same, so it was usually like they lost their families, they're forced to go out on their own, they're forced to make a life for themselves. And both of them kind of think, or know, that their parents are dead. And so, they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going, and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them, 'cause I think Ile [sic], or, I don't know how to say her name. She kind of motivated Girda to kind of stay in the camp with her, and have maybe a friend there, where with Abek's [sic] family, she wouldn't really have a friend, she'd just have, like she'd owe it to their family to do things for them. And then with Achek [sic], he had William K. to help him--
 [Boy in gray] Just had a friend to make it through.
 [Kaylee] Yeah.
 [Teacher] So they both had a  strong friend. What kind of life did they both live before disaster struck?
 [Boy in gray] They both had the  perfect, ideal family life, you know. They were happy. They were all together. It was, you know, like what would happen in a Disney movie, pretty much. Everything's kinda perfect. And then, something happens in the first. Both, in the person that happens to meet, their family ties are cut. And their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them, and kinda grow, and become stronger.
 [Kaylee] Yeah. I think...
 [Boy in black] Yeah.
 [Kaylee] No, you go.
 [Boy in black] Okay. They were just,  I mean, they were forced to grow up. And they just lived, like Ryan said, like the ideal life, with their family, or whatever. But once their parents left, they had to find a friend, or someone to group with, in order to--
 [Teacher] Well, what were they  replacing? What were they replacing, with William K and Ile [sic]?
 [Kaylee] Yeah. They established a family without being blood related.
 [Boy in black] They just had  to make it through by that. It's 'cause if you don't have motivation, then you're not going to get through things, so even though they didn't know that their... I mean, they assumed their parents were dead, but they didn't know for sure. 'Cause on page 80 of this, I mean, she said that she never saw her father again. But, just to know that their parents are alive, and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive.
 [Teacher] Not knowing. They  both have that in common.
 [Boy in black] Right.
 [Teacher] Assuming that they're dead,  but not really knowing for sure.
 [Boy in black] Just to keep them  motivated to survive, so it's a good tactic.
 [Teacher] So what is a really  simple message that we can take from that, from both of their stories? What do you need in your life?
 [Boy in black] Motivation.
 [Kaylee] You need family. You need some kind of family unit to...
 [Boy in black] Survive. Or friends.
 [Boy in gray] Everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to, and they can depend on, no matter what the situation is.
 [Boy in black] Right, and if you're  going to friends a lot of time, at least in like a high school, or whatever; you go to friends with questions, instead of your family, or whatever, sometimes you'll get the wrong side of view on things, and it will change your life drastically. 'Cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be, determines how the rest of your life...
 [Boy in gray] But also, you  got a different perspective, 'cause your family doesn't necessarily know what's going on in your own high school.
 [Boy in black] Yeah, so it's  good to get both, but family is more important 'cause you can count on them more usually.
 [Kaylee] And they're older and wiser. You need that kind of like wise person, 'cause my mom knows more than I do or my friends.
 [Boy in black] Yeah.
 [Teacher] But you need those  relationships as connections, right?
 [Boy in black] Right, to keep motivated.
 [Teacher] Both of those stories show that really, literally life and death situations; those connections with other humans. It is a human basic need that we have to make those connections. Or you cannot survive. I think both of those stories... That's a really good question, in looking at the stages. It also shows globally... Globally, what can we say about families? At the beginning of the story... you were talking about, it's like a Disney movie, right?
 [Boy in gray] Yeah.
 [Teacher] So what can we say about families literally around the world?
 [Kaylee] They're all usually together. Nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where, like how they're supposed to live, and like, what's good and bad. You usually nurture your kids 'til they're about nineteen, and then they go off to college. I think that's just how it is everywhere. It may not be that way in some places, but you usually have schooling, and then you go off, and then you figure out for yourself, once you've got a base.
 [Boy in black] Yeah, they're  usually pretty perfect or ideal, until like a third party, like Nazis or the Arabians come in and just wipe that out, and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves, and I guess their friends, since they didn't have family.
 [Teacher] And that family unit seems to lend to safety, even if you're living in  Sudan or if you're living in Poland. The children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives, right?
 [Boy in black] Right.
 [Kaylee] And if nobody knows you, what makes you... if you die who would care? That's what I would think. Like, if nobody cared about me, or nobody knew who I was.
 [Boy in black] That's, what,  a lot of suicidal thoughts...
 [Kaylee] Yeah.
 [Boys](laughter)
 [Kaylee] I was just thinking.  I don't think that, but I'm just saying, if I had nobody to be like I care about you. You need to stay alive, or like your parents. There wouldn't be a reason to live.
 [boy in black] Yeah, but like  in those stories, like they find symbolic fixtures, or whatever. I think in both, yeah, the moon. They look at the moon and they see, they just see the moon, and it's like their kinda friend. But they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere, or wherever they are, 'cause they don't know.
 [Boy in gray] Yeah, their parents  are looking at the same thing that they're seeing, kinda.
 [Boy in black] Yeah, so it's  kinda like, right there, keeping them together.
 [Teacher] And what's funny,  is that's a main... the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone.
 [Boy in black] Yeah.
 [Teacher] And he refers to that also.
 [Kaylee] I think 'cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth. It's a connection, I think, somewhere. Yeah.
 [Boy in black] Yeah, totally.
 [Boy in gray] It's kinda like the  bright light in darkness. You know, the night, it's a pictch black, but the moon's shining. You know, kinda there no matter what. Good. Okay, keep going.
 [Boy in hoodie] And the German's  are just coming in, and everything's getting really bad. And like going back to their past, and showing it as such a nice place. What she does, is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison.
 [Teacher] Okay, what was the question?
 [Boy in black] How does the author  implement setting to contrast, good and evil? How is it affected?
 [Teacher] Okay.
 [Boy in black] ...purpose. And we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker, because it's happening in this nice place.
 [Girl in yellow] But she's forced  to saying the dark side of things, 'cause she's forced into her basement, where it's all dark, and you know, there's mildew on the wall, and it's flooded, and it's just really gross down there. And that's what's happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in. And then, her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days. You know, running with her friends, and chasing butterflies, and eating sweets. And it's just really happy, and bright, and cheery. And so, there's a major contrast.
 [Teacher] And, as you go into the  book, does that darkness continue? Or is it broken by light? How does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps?
 [Boy in hoodie] There's...
 [Boy in black] Go ahead, but I have an answer.
 [Teacher] OK. (laughs)
 [Boy in hoodie] At least up to the point where we've read, she's kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything. Arthur's letters stopped coming. And that's kind of the climax from how far we've gotten, where the darkness is. So now it's about finding the good things that are in that darkness.
 [Girl in glasses] Right. I think she has little flashes of good things, and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her, of a bright future. But it is surrounded by darkness.
 [Teacher] And in the camp, did she talk about physically light and dark also?
 [Boy in black] Like the dramas,  and she wrote plays; And they had fun there.
 [Girl in glasses] The single light shining in the dark room .
 [Teacher] Do you have anything to add, Abbey? Can you think of times when she talked about light? Physically, light in the camps? I was trying to think. And how does she portray it? 'Cause that is an interesting motif in the book, the light and dark. And it will continue to play a part. Which camp is she in at the middle part?
 [Boy in black] She's in the, I can't pronounce it. It's the first one, where she's, they're sewing, they're weaving.
 [Teacher] So they're at the looms, right?
 [Girl in yelow] Yeah, they're at the looms.
 [Boy in hoodie] Did she pass  through Auschwitz? Or was that the one, she was in jail? I think she passed through Volkenheim [sic]?
 [Teacher] Yeah. Does she ever get outside? That would be a key, at Volkenheim [sic].
 [Boy in black] Outside of the camp itself?
 [Teacher] Just outside, in the outside.
 [Girl in yellow] Well, here's a  reference to outside. She talks about how the night was starry and beautiful. "From Heirgonk [sic] I could see the hill through a window. Slowly, the full moon rose..." So that is like a light in the darkness, literally. Because the stars... the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky, and just, her finding that comfort in that, also shows really extreme light and dark.
 [Teacher] But her comfort comes at night, in the darkness. And she has one source of light. So keep looking for those motifs of light and dark 'cause they play a part throughout. Have any of you gotten past the halfway point?
 [Girl in glasses] Yeah.
 [Girl in yellow] Yeah, we've gotten  a little bit past.
 [Teacher] In the march, you know that becomes very important. Alright, good. Good job. Alright, you guys! Bell's gonna ring. Keep your questions for tomorrow
