 Keep the rhythm sync. Soft. As we do our solos, here if you would take your pencils, and when you hear the soloists play, on these notes on the side of this changing. I want you to put a mark beside that change where you are. Put a count on it. Each rotation will be different. Sometimes they may play from the middle scale to the middle or the whole thing. Wherever you think that happens. I will be documenting it over here, too. All right. Today's volunteers are, beginning with the vibe player, and then we'll just go through the trumpets, the trombones, and saxes and those others who are assigned to play today. Here we go everybody got pencils ready? And one, one, two, three, four. [xylophone solo] Here we go Rockville. On my mark. One, two, ready. . . [trumpet solo] One, two, and one, two ready play. [trombone solo]
