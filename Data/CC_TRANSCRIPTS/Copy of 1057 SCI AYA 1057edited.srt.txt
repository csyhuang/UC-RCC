[Voiceover] Yes, I think if it's really, really quiet, and you want to talk about something, then, go ahead. But if a lot of people obviously want to talk, probably a good idea to raise our hands. Okay, what else?
[Voiceover] Be involved?
Be involved, yes. I will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion. Because everybody has an opinion, but I need you to express that opinion. What else?
[Voiceover] Don't criticize other peoples' ideas.
Don't criticize other peoples' ideas. Okay? What might you do instead? (classroom chatter) Suggest something, give your outlook, give your opinion. Okay. Give your argument. But don't insult the other person's ideas. This is a safe place to share ideas, okay? Now we're going to have three jobs. I'm going to need a task master, a reader, and a time-keeper.
[Voiceover] Time-keeper!
You want to be the time-keeper? Alright, you need to let us know when we've got about two minutes left of the class.
[Girl in Necklace] I want to be the task master.
[Teacher] Okay, so what does the task master do?
[Girl Wearing Necklace] They make sure that everybody's on task.
[Teacher] Yeah, what else? What might that look like?
[Girl in Gray Hoodie] Subjects get off, or out of control.
[Teacher] So, people get off subject, we could, a little bit of crowd control. What about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands?
[Girl in Gray Hoodie] You get to pick on one.
[Teacher] Yeah, task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk. Okay? Yes?
[Voiceover] Is there a praiser?
[Teacher] Actually, that's a good idea. Let's have a praiser.
[Boy in Blue Shirt] I want to be him.
[Teacher] You want to be the praiser? Alright, Michael is the praiser. What's the praiser do?
[Voiceover] Oh, can I do that? (class chatter)
[Girl in Blue Jacket] Dang it, always.
[Voiceover] You can team up with me.
[Girl in Blue Jacket] Can we?
[Teacher] This class, yeah, you guys want to be a team? Okay. So, what is a praiser? What are you guys going to do?
[Voiceover] Give compliments.
[Teacher] Okay, give compliments. Compliment their ideas, their expressions, okay? And then I need a reader. Preferably somebody on that side of the room.
[Voiceover] I don't know how to read. I'm unavailable.
[Teacher] You'll read?
[Voiceover] No.
[Teacher] Who would like to read? (classroom chatter)
[Teacher] About five seconds before I call on someone.
[Voiceover] I'll do it.
[Teacher] Okay so, the questions are all up here, there's five of them. You're going to read them so the whole group can hear.
[Voiceover] Okay.
[Teacher] Okay? Alright, so, task master...
[Voiceover] Oh, I'm here.
[Teacher] Okay, you're on task now, and we're going to start by having the reader read us the first question.
[Girl in White Hoodie] Okay, should people own ideas? (laughs)
[Boy in Varsity Jacket] I don't really think so, I think it should be shared, like for public opinion. Like, public knowledge, like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet.
[Voiceover] Great thought.
[Boy in Varsity Jacket] Thanks.
[Girl in Blue Jacket] You're doing good.
[Boy in Black Beanie] Well, I think that the information should be shared, but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it.
[Girl in White Jacket] I think that if you come up with an idea, shouldn't you have some like, you have conferences, everybody gets together and talks about stuff. So, why don't you have scientists and stuff, that like created this idea, come together and have a conference and talk about it, so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff. And then the people that made, that contributed to it, have like a patent, I guess you would say, or just like, copy, or not copyright it.
[Voiceover] Like discovered by, or?
[Girl in White Jacket] Yeah, like that.
[Voiceover] Good opinion.
[Voiceover] So, coming together would be easier then.
[Girl in White Hoodie] Sometimes I feel like, if... If no one gets credited, or gets, yeah. (laughs) They won't want to like... They won't want to--
[Voiceover] Put the information out there.
[Girl in White Hoodie] Yeah, put the information out there. Like they won't have something to, you know...
[Voiceover] Work for?
[Girl in White Hoodie] Work for! There you go. (laughs)
[Girl in White Jacket] Yeah, because I think that everybody like wants a part of getting like (mumbles). Because you want that credit, because you put all that effort into it. So, why not get a little bit of credit? That makes it worth it. How do you like that one?
[Voiceover] Okay, second question. Should people own genes?
[Voiceover] No.
[Voiceover] Yes. (class chatter)
[Boy in Varsity Jacket] Well, you kind of already own your own genes. I mean you kind of, they're your own. Like any, unless you clone yourself, I mean, nobody else has the exact same stuff. (mumbles) You could.
[Teacher] Let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene. The breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video, which is actually a lack thereof, of a particular part of a gene, that is patented by a particular company. Which means they found it, they spent money to find it, so they own the patent on it. If you are a person, you don't have to be female just to look for this, but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene, you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it. That's what it means to own a gene.
[Girl in White Jacket] I think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money, that can be like, "Oh I'm going to put a patent on that, "so boo-ya, can't take it."
[Girl in Black Jacket] Yeah I don't think that's right. I mean, if someone, they should like put it open to the public, because I mean if it's a gene like, say breast cancer, they should't just keep that private and make they pay for it.
[Voiceover] Yeah.
[Woman in Glasses] So, it's sort of like owning a part of a human. If you own a gene by a corporation, it's like owning a part of the person who has that gene, or doesn't have that gene. So... It's sort of a moral issue. Would you want to be owned by a company, just that little tiny part of your DNA? I wouldn't.
[Voiceover] Excellent point.
[Voiceover] You would?
[Voiceover] Good job, Jenna.
[Voiceover] I wouldn't.
[Voiceover] Oh, okay.
[Voiceover] You practically just went against everything we just said. (laughs)
[Voiceover] Anybody else have any input? (classroom chatter)
[Voiceover] I agree with Jen.
[Girl in White Hoodie] Okay, third question. Would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer?
[Several Students in Unison] Yeah.
[Several Students in Unison] No.
[Voiceover] I would not.
[Voiceover] Well, it depends on what age I'm at.
[Boy in Varsity Jacket] Because like, then you have that whole impending like, doom your whole entire life, like, "Oh, I'm eventually going to get cancer, "might as well just die."
[Boy in Black] That's why I die, (mumbles)
[Woman in Glasses] But if you do know, then you have the chance to actually deal with it.
[Voiceover] You're going to have to deal with it, anyway.
[Woman in Glasses] Yeah, but if you knew, you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life. You would know, you would live life to the fullest, I would. I would live life to the fullest if I knew that I actually had this cancer. I would know and I would do the best I could to live my life without settling.
[Girl in Blue Jacket] Yeah, so the shadow of you, that eventually (mumbles).
[Woman in Glasses] And that would just push me forward, considering--
[Voiceover] Drive yourself.
[Woman in Glasses] Whatever I do. Yeah. And maybe, just maybe if I knew, I would work to try to cure it myself. So, then I would be helping other people as well. I would want to know.
[Teacher] Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions. Please feel free to share.
[Girl in White Jacket] I think my, what's it called, my opinion, I'd want to know so that, if you didn't know, and you have kids you could be passing it on to them, and wouldn't that hurt you to see that, to have your kids have cancer? Like, I would think that. And then, if like I did, I would want to know, I would, like Jen said, live life to my fullest, and... Because some things, like, if I was, per se white, I would go tanning, wouldn't that hurt your cancer? Because like, radiat-- Well that's what causes it, you know what I mean? I'd just do things differently if I had it.
[Teacher] Remember what they said in the video, it's often a maybe. It's not a "you will have this," it's a maybe. There are things that they can check for that they can say definitely, you will or will not get, like Huntington's Disease, which is a very devastating disease. Remember how they talked about Tay-Sachs, which kills very early? Huntington's is somewhat similar, but it kills later in life. And starts to show signs mid-30's, and usually death is somewhere in the 40's or 50's, so that's significantly earlier, since life expectancy is in the 70's in this country. So... Would you want to know, yes or no, if you had something like Huntington's, which is definitely a yes or no, but what about in a situation that's a maybe?
[Boy in Beanie] I don't want to know if it's a maybe, because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not.
[Woman in Glasses] I would still want to know.
[Voiceover] Yeah, because what if your body starts shutting down like, one night, and you just start twitching in your sleep? (laughs) Wouldn't you want to know that's from cancer, rather than your brain's messed up, and drugs or something, I don't know.
[Girl in Black Jacket] Yeah, I think I'd want to know. I mean like, instead of just not knowing what's causing all this stuff happening in your body. Some think it's because I'm a very curious person. (laughs) I'd want to know what's going on.
[Girl Wearing Necklace] I would want to know. Because like Jenna said, like one night you're just having a seizure or something, you could take, like, medicine, like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have, rather than just like, trying to deal with it, and like, that you could die, because you never even knew what was happening. So I'd like, want to have that back-up plan with me.
[Teacher] So, just to clarify, we're talking about an offense end, rather than a defense team. So, rather than waiting until you have it and reacting, taking preventative measures ahead of time.
[Woman in Glasses] Like an inhaler for asthma. Some people have to take their inhaler every single day, twice a day, morning and the afternoon, but there's other people who don't have it as severe, or a higher risk, not as high as a risk, who only take it when they're having an asthma attack. So, what you're saying is, having like the pill every day, constantly. I would still want to take that chance.
[Voiceover] So, you would you want to take the pill?
[Woman in Glasses] Yeah.
[Girl in Black and Gray Hoodie] If you know you have cancer early enough, can't you get rid of it? Can't they get rid of it? If it's like... (classroom chatter)
[Teacher] Yes, the earlier you know, the better chance you have.
[Girl in Black and Gray Hoodie] Yeah, that's why I would want to know.
[Girl in Gray Coat] I don't think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer, that doesn't mean you're going to die from it. Like, you could get hit by a car today, and nobody could tell you that, nobody could predict that. So, I don't think... I wouldn't want to know, like if I was going to, if I have cancer or anything. I don't know, I don't think it's--
[Girl in White Jacket] You don't know that that cancer's going to (mumbles).
[Girl in Gray Coat] Yeah, and then I'm just going to be in fear all my life, like, thinking, like "Oh, I'm going to die from that." When that's not necessarily... Like, the, you know, exact thing that you're going to die from. Like, it's not a guarantee, so.
[Voiceover] Very good.
[Voiceover] Yeah, it's because of that--
[Voiceover] Great job!
[Boy in Varsity Jacket] It's because of that maybe, that maybe, like you might be, like how that guy on the video said, you have a 99% of getting a heart disorder, you might be that one percent that doesn't get it. And you spend your whole life preparing, spending all this money on preventative measures, and getting all these pills, setting up stuff, and then you go through your whole entire life, and you don't even get it.
[Voiceover] That's true.
[Voiceover] That, he does have a point.
[Voiceover] But then wouldn't you want to take those precautions, because--
[Voiceover] You'd be happy that you did, but then you spent all that extra stuff.
[Voiceover] But what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it?
[Voiceover] No I mean, you don't like, you don't, get all the stuff just in case, and you don't take, it's like, you don't even take the medicine. It's only for like, when you have like, Travis said, if you have a seizure, you can take that, it stops it.
[Girl in Black Jacket] Well, that's kind of just like getting hit by a car.
[Voiceover] Exactly.
[Girl in Black Jacket] Preventative measures is like, looking to see if there's cars, and if you don't look I mean, you could get run over, you could not. (classroom chatter)
[Boy in Black Beanie] But then you also, like, what if you lived in fear of getting that, taking all these precautions, is kind of wasting your life, trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen.
[Woman in Glasses] That's why people should, at the right age when you have the right maturity, decide whether you want to know or not, and not have it mapped out when you're born, whether you're going to die or not. Or by what.
[Girl in White Jacket] In the movie, how they just like, took that thing.
[Woman in Glasses] Right.
[Girl in White Jacket] That would be freaky as a woman. Like, you just went all throughout nine months of that, and now you get to find out that your child's going to die in it's kind of freaky.
[Voiceover] That actually brings us to our next question.
[Girl in White Hoodie] Okay. What genes would you want to know your children had? Why, and how would that change you as a parent?
[Voiceover] I wouldn't want to know, at all. I mean, that's part of giving like, human birth, the surprise, I guess.
[Voiceover] It's a gamble.
[Voiceover] You can't always like, create the perfect human being.
[Boy in Varsity Jacket] Well, if you could find out, what genes they were going to have, could you fix them? Like how that person got rid of the forehead thing?
[Teacher] Right now, no. But that is a direction we're heading in. You can, right now, completely sequence your child's genome, if you have the money, and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that--
[Voiceover] That's messed up.
[Voiceover] I don't care what my child would look like, I don't really care. But, I just don't, like you could prevent it from having, these like, life-threatening diseases, like cancer or Huntington's, or like Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's.
[Girl in White Jacket] But then again, that's a way of like too, like... I would want to know life-threatening diseases, but not, because like you can cure, like seizures. You can like, can't you? Like, my friend's been cured of that. She had them and then now she doesn't anymore because she took medicine and stuff, now she doesn't have it. But there's people that have been taking those medicines, and then still have it now, which doesn't make sense.
[Teacher] Is that cured, or treated?
[Girl in White Jacket] Treated.
[Teacher] Yeah. Cured means that you no longer have the disease. Treated means that it's managed with medication, or--
[Girl in White Jacket] It's treated, then. Wait, it's cured. Yeah, it is cured. (laughs) But, anyways (mumbles).
[Teacher] How would that change you as a parent, knowing that?
[Voiceover] You would know what to do if you have it.
[Boy in Red Jacket] Stay with your child at all times. (laughs) I don't want my kid dying.
[Voiceover] Your kid's going to be in like a stroller, until age 13.
[Voiceover] See, it wouldn't change me as a parent. It just wouldn't change me.
[Girl in White Jacket] I think it'd make someone stronger. Because going through all of that hard times, like with your child and it being sick and stuff, wouldn't that make you stronger than having a normal, healthy child? And make you closer to them?
[Voiceover] But you would still love your child the same way. You would still try to have the best memories with your child, either way. If you knew that this, that your child was going to die, or not. You would still do the same thing. Except maybe change their diet, or...
[Voiceover] Take more precautions.
[Woman in Glasses] Yeah, more precautions. Pad their room. They're going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something. But, you wouldn't change your experiences with your child.
[Voiceover] I would.
Well, I wouldn't. Would you Bernard?
[Voiceover] What?
[Woman in Glasses] Change your experience with your child?
Yeah.
[Voiceover] Just don't go to Disneyland, it's not worth it.
[Boy in Blue Shirt] It's not worth it, he won't even remember it.
[Boy in Red Jacket] Nope.
[Girl in White Hoodie] Oh, the fifth question. What does any of this have to do with you?
[Voiceover] Like as in personally, or as in?
[Voiceover] That's a good question.
[Girl in Black Hoodie] I'm confused.
[Voiceover] Say that again.
[Girl in Black Hoodie] As in personally?
[Voiceover] Yeah, both ways, as in persoanlly and as in a generation. (classroom chatter)
[Voiceover] Give yourself super powers?
[Girl in Necklace] Hey, stay on task. (laughs)
[Voiceover] Good job, Stella.
[Girl in Necklace] Thanks. (laughs)
[Girl in White Hoodie] I guess you're just kind of getting us ready for the future, you know? Like, thinking, like about your children, like, in the future, like what if, like what if you really wanted to know, and then like, what would you actually do about it, if you've never thought about this before.
[Voiceover] Is this technology possible?
[Several Students At Once] Yeah.
[Teacher] Not quite yet. So, who's going to have to make those decisions?
[Several Students At Once] Us.
[Voiceover] Our generation.
[Woman in Glasses] This generation and next generation. (classroom chatter)
[Woman in Glasses] The genes are us. And if you want to know everything about yourself, if you want to know, then you have to go through the genes. But if you don't want to know, then you don't have to.
[Girl in White Jacket] Yeah. And so those people that think it's like... That want to know, should... Wait, what? Never mind.
[Voiceover] Should be able to.
[Girl in White Jacket] Yeah, should be able to. And then, the people that don't want to know, shouldn't harp on them, they should just keep their opinions to themselves. And see it from their eyes too, and just have an open eye to it, not being so negative.
[Teacher] So what happens if, say half of society, would like to have their genomes sequenced, or their children's genome sequenced, and the other half does not want to, or doesn't have the means to, because it's probably going to cost money. Right? What might that, how might that impact society as a whole? Not just the individual. As in this country, individual's rights are paramount, right? Hmm?
[Voiceover] So, it'll be messed up like it is already. (laughs)
How?
