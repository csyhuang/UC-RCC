[Teacher] Now, I'm going to get to what we are beginning to learn today. I'm going to go ahead and put my tie up here... Now, is there anyone who can tell me what this is? What is that, Daniel?
[Daniel] A dotted eighth note.
This is a dotted eighth note. Who can tell me what this note is? Sedekia?
[Sedekia] One sixteenth note.
It is a sixteenth note, so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note. Now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot. With that in mind, can somebody tell me what the value of that note is? Cole?
[Cole] It would last for like three beats.
[Instructor] Three beats...
[Cole] And then you would have a sixteenth note. Okay, I think you're on the right track, it would last for three of something, but not three beats, Landon?
[Landon] Three fourths of a beat?
It would be three fourths of a beat, so let's think about this, remember, an eighth note in 4/4 time gets half of a beat. Everybody, what's half of a half?
[student] One fourth.
One fourth, so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat, that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat. Well that sounds a little bit complicated, but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here. So who can tell me what I would write for counts under this dotted eighth note? Raise your hand. Lydon?
[Lydon] Would it be one, e &?
One e &, because that's the same as having three of both, and Jaylin what would go here?
[Jaylin] a e.
Okay, so this is just another way of writing this. Let's do a measure of counting that. Ready? And, go, and...
[together with clapping] One e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and...
Now, I want all my first row to do that four times, okay? And, go, and...
[students] One e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and
Second row, ready, and, go, and...
[students] One e and a two, and one e and a two.
