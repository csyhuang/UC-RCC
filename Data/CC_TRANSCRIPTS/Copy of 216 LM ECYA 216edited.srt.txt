Hi, welcome to the library  media center. At the entrance, we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings. At our situation desk we have a suggestion box, our series list, and magazines  and books to entice students as they check out. In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners, as well  as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout. For the teachers, I have a professional library with over 3,000 books, DVDs, manipulatives and kits, developed to support the curriculum. Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library. The paperbacks, a student favorite, arranged by genre just like in retail stores. All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series. I give special consideration to my reluctant reader's needs if students interests were looking for fiction, or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels. We have 13 desktop computers, and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet, numerous databases, Impact, and a variety of software. On the school library website, they find reviews,  blogs, links to resarch sites,  as well as book suggestions, trainers, and podcasts, many of which are created by the students. On the left-hand side of the library, the reference and the non-fiction sections are located. Our many biographies are housed on the non-fiction side of the center counter. I have many displays throughout the  library and around the school, but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews, or projects, and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics. I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following  my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons  a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service.

(inaudible). (background chatter)
But we don't, we don't find our food and just like... (background chatter)
The three little pig wolf thing? (inaudible).
(inaudible).
She counted all the way up. And she wants to know the lines or something.
We're going to, now that you guys have most of your categories filled in, I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that's in front of you. There are two reviews for this book. Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review. If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist, or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge, then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews. If you find something in common, circle it on your graphic organizer. I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews. And again, you can work with your partner on this one. (background chatter)
(inaudible).
(inaudible). (background chatter)
(inaudible).
(inaudible) it talks about what they deserve and (inaudible). (background chatter)
30 more seconds. That's okay, (inaudible). Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked  for and found in the story? and what you find in the review?
[Students] Yes.
 The review has some additional items in it, doesn't it? There are a lot of people  with the same basic items. Anyway, I wanted to do a quick Venn-diagram up here, and compare and contrast. I want for each group, this group, I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn't in the review. Or, one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper. Okay, (inaudible). Okay, you guys, I want you to find, one for each of those groups, I want you to find one thing that was in common (inaudible). So this is compare, this is contrast. Contrast, compare. Find one thing that was in common, and one thing that's different. Oh, okay, here's a sticky in the middle of the table, I want you to write it on the sticky. You guys (inaudible) hard. (background chatter) (inaudible) Awesome, step up here and tell  us what it is and where does it go(inaudible). ?
(inaudible). Awesome, perfect. So all you guys came up with a (inaudible). (inaudible)
We did like don't count your chickens  before they hatch (inaudible) and it was in our graphic organizer (inaudible).
Oh, okay, (inaudible).
(inaudible).
(inaudible).
Perfect, and that was (inaudible).
(inaudible).,
Good, perfect. Okay, so everybody here found something that they had that wasn't in the review, it was in their graphic organizer. (inaudible). You guys, come on up. This table, everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review.
We found (inaudible).
Super, (inaudible).
(inaudible).
Super, so that goes in the middle because it's in common with both of them. This group?
(inaudible).
Perfect, they found both in the review and in their organizer that (inaudible).
(inaudible).
So that was a? What category (inaudible)?
(inaudible).
Oh, was that in common? Did you find it in the review also or was it...?
(inaudible).
Just you guys found it? So where would it go? Excellent, excellent. That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn't in the review, so it would go over here, perfect. Okay, next?
We found that the (inaudible).
Okay, so you found something that was only in the review that the, how the pigs disguised themselves. Where do we put that on that? Excellent, something that was only found in the review. Save the best for last. What'd you guys find?
We found that the graphic organizer and the review, they both talked about (inaudible) that related to (inaudible) like the (inaudible).
The allusions in there, Wizard of Oz, Three Little Pigs, Excellent, that was (inaudible). So we see an awful lot is in common with these. Sometimes, you guys find something that aren't in the reviews, the reviews sometimes had  something you didn't find. They are a little bit different. Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is. You won't necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there, and that's okay. What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book, and give a substantiated opinion of the book. Why do (inaudible)? What are the good features of this book? What are the weaknesses in the book that you read? Now there are other things that you may need in there, and I'll show where you can get some additional information. Let's bring this on down here. In the online catalog. Both of those computers are logged in over there. (inaudible). Okay, look up. So far (inaudible). So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself, "Oh yeah, that was a really long book",  or "Oh, that was a quick read." That would be something to kind of jog your memory there. Things like, "Oh yeah, this was about Korea."
