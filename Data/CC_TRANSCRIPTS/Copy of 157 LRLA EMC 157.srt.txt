It's "er."
"Er. " Everybody say "er."
[together] "Er."
Okay. What we're going to do... If you remember last week, we looked at some pictures. And when you heard the "er" sound, what sound did you make?
"Er."
No.
[together] E-R.
What did you make?
Tweet, tweet.
Tweet, tweet because a bird says tweet, tweet and a bird has "er." So my first picture is a train. Do you hear it?
Yes, ma'am.
No.
Do you hear an "er"?
Oh, no. No.
So are you going to say tweet, tweet?

Think about it. Don't say it yet. What word?
[together] Term.
Term. Eyes up here. Okay. Good. Now we're going to go to our work mats and we're going to build some words, okay? Okay. You can give the students a point, because you all did a very good job. Everybody was paying attention and participating. All right, watch how Miss Dodd is doing this because you're going to do the same thing. Get your word mat out in front of you and put your letters out so you can see them. We have to go kind of quick. I'm going to put this on top of this just for now, okay?
Thanks.
You're welcome. All right. Let's see. Let's see how fast we can get those out. Let's see. I'm going to say we can do it in 40 seconds. Let me help you out. Let's put all these out so you can see them.
You have a lot of words.
Shh.
Okay. We're not putting them down on the mat. We're going to put them up here and then we're going to pull them down to the mat. There we go.
Economics.
Shh.
All right. Let's see if we made it. Are we all done?
Yes, ma'am.
All right. Give the students another point because you did it in enough time. Okay. Miss Dodd has the words up here, also, the word parts. So first, let's look at the ending parts, okay? What do you think this says?
[together] "Er."
"Er." Very good. Look at this next one. What does this say?
[together] "Urt."
"Urt." Eyes up here. Eyes up here. Good.
What does this say?
[together] "Er."
Good. What does this say?
[together] "Urse."
And what does this say?
[together] "Erve."
Okay. These are the same cards that you have, so we're going to make some words, okay?
Okay.
First, we're going to start with "urt." U-R-T. So let's pull that down to where it says rhyme. U-R-T. Okay? And I want you to make the word hurt. Hurt.
Good job. All right. Let's spell hurt together.
[together] H-U-R-T. Hurt.
Very good. All right. So Miss Dodd will pull down my H and it looks like everybody got that. Okay. Now I want you to take your U-R. Pull down your U-R. Okay? And this time, I'm going to give you a clue. I want you to make the word that is something that is on an animal. Covers an animal. Keeps him warm. His what? We don't want our H right now. Let's see if you can figure it out. You should have U-R right here, okay? And now we're going to... So what was the answer to my clue?
[together] Fur.
Fur. Spell it.
[together] F-U-R. Fur.
Keep your U-R and I want you to make the word spur. Spur. We talked about this word last week. A spur. Okay? Yes.
Who put the things out?
I did. Okay. Who remembers what a spur is?
Something that you kick?
Very good. Here's a picture of a spur. Remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and it makes the horse go fast? Okay. So I should pull down my S-P and this word is?
[together] Spur.
Very good. All right. I want you to pull down your U-R-S-E. U-R-S-E. And you shouldn't have anything in front of the U-R-S-E. You should just have it just like Madison has it here. She doesn't have anything for onset. She only has her rhyme. Okay? All right. What does that part say?
[together] "Urse."
"Urse." Okay. I want you to add a P and see what word you get and if you have a D, you might want to flip it over. It's also a P. Okay? All right. What word is that?
[together] Purse.
Purse. Very good. Okay. I want you to take your I-R and pull it down. And this time, I want you to make your own word with I-R. It might not be the same word your neighbor makes. I want you to make your own word with I-R. Look at all the onset parts that you have and see what you can add to "ir." Good job.
All right. Let's look at what we came up with. What did you come up with?
Sir.
Sir. Okay. So I'll pull down my S here. This word is sir. That is correct and I see a few people have sir. Let's see. Let's look at this one. What did you make?
Spir.
But what two letters actually say "ur" in spur?
I-R?
Not I-R. Remember?
U-R.
Yep. Let's put it up here so we remember it. Spur is S-P-U-R.
I've got another one.
All right.
Dirt.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
How do you spell dirt?
Oh, yeah. Wait. Oh yeah.
We might not have that ending, but do you know how to spell dirt? D...
I-R-T.
Very good. All right. Let's move on to another one. Oh, I see that you have G-I-R. "Gir." What were you thinking when you wrote that? Can you use that in a sentence? No? Okay. This one is not a word, okay? Now we're going to pull out our E-R-V-E. E-R-V-E. Let's see how quickly we can get it up. You all are doing a good job. You're all probably going to get another point. E-R-V-E. Okay? And I want you to fill in the blank. The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food. The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food. What can we put in front of the E-R-V-E that would complete that sentence? It's got to make sense. All right. What is this word?
"Erve."
Let's see. What if I were to put an S? What word would I have?
Serve?
Serve. Does that make sense in my sentence? Do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food? Yeah. So what word did we come up with?
[together] Serve.
Serve. Very good. Okay. So this is what I want you to do. I want you to take all your cards just like Miss Dodd's doing here and I'm just going to put them together pretty quick. I don't have to really take my time here and then I'm going to stick them on my page. We're going to make a pile in the middle. Good job. All right. Good. And remember, it doesn't have to be perfect. Good job. And let's take it all...
Is this yours?
Good job.
No.
All right. I'm going to go ahead and hand you our story. We're going to take what we've learned and take it to text. We're going to read a story that has lots of words that have the "er" sound.
This looks like [inaudible].
I have one.
Yeah. That one's his.
Curls that swirl.
All right.
I can't put it...
Whoa. It's got 12 pages.
Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and take those so we can go ahead and start reading, okay? Okay. You can give the students a point because you did a good job last time. Okay. I'm going to give everybody a highlighter because as we're reading, I want you highlighting words that have the "er" sound. Okay? So what's my title?
[together] Curls that swirl.
Very good. Do you see some words that have the "er" sound?
Yes, ma'am.
Let's highlight them. What's my first word?
Curls.
U-R.
Curls. What's my next word that has "er"?
[together] Swirl.
Swirl. Very good. All right. Curls that swirl. What are they talking about, about curls? What kind of curls are they talking about?
Like curls in your hair.
Curls in your hair. Very good. Okay. As we're going, I'm going to be putting the words up here, okay? So we have curls and we have swirl and we will use these words again tomorrow. Okay, so let's open up to the first page.
Miss Dodd? Miss Dodd?
Highlight it again?
No highlighting yet, okay?
Cheryl? Oh, okay. Well, come up. No, no. We're on this page here. Page three at the bottom, okay?
Okay.
Okay. So let's see how quickly we can get to page three. All right. What we're going to do is I want you following along. Miss Dodd's going to model how we're going to read this page. As I'm reading, you can highlight when I say an "er" word. Does everybody understand the directions?
[together] Yes, ma'am.
Okay, but you need to be listening because after this, we're going to read it all together, okay? Here we go. Once there was a small girl who had hair that curled and swirled and twirled. Drop where you hand is.
I messed up.
That's okay. We'll go back and look at it.
This one?
We'll talk about it. It swirled over her shirt and way past her skirt. Okay. Now. Stop. No, no. We're going to just look at that one page because I see some things that make me ask some questions. What word did you ask me about?
That wasn't me.
Did you ask me about a word? What word?
There.
There. Okay. Let's look at the word there. Okay. Now should we highlight there?
Yes, ma'am.
Raise your hand if you say yes we should. Raise your hand if you say no we shouldn't. Okay. Well, let's look at it. Does it have E-R like we're looking for?
[together] Yes.
It does, but does it say "er"?
No.
No. It has a different sound. Every E-R isn't going to say "er." It's just going to be special times, so in this case, should we highlight it?
[together] No.
No, okay. And it's okay if you did, okay? All right. Let's go ahead and read it together now. Everybody follow along. Let's put our finger under the first word or your highlighter is fine.
