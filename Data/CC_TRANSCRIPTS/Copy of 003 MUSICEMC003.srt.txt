The whole song isn't a cappella. It's a cappella in parts. Yeah. It starts out a cappella, which means no piano. Jeffrey, sit up. It's a cappella for a little while, and then the piano comes in. Then it's a cappella again, and then the piano comes in, and then it ends a cappella. So it kind of goes back and forth. What we want to get from this, for today, from this piece, is I want to hear your expression. I want to hear that crescendo, that decrescendo. Same thing on the word "clouds." What do we think? What should... It's another one of those long notes. So we need to do something with it. What should we do with it? Decrescendo? Put a crescendo in it? Energize it a little bit? Should we try each? Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better? So the long "cloud" ♪ [Where the clouds, where the clouds can fly.] ♪ Two of them. We have two of them.
