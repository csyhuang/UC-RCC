Okay. So, basically that's improvising. I'm giving you a lot of ideas for improvising. Okay? And you will only use three notes when you improvise. D, F, and G. You don't have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes. When you improvise, there are certain rules to improvising. You can't just play any note, because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice. Okay? So, we don't want to play the wrong note. So, please make sure that you only play D, F, and G. Do you see that tune that's on whatever page that's on for you guys? There should be a page that's got solos at the top, and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune. You'll pick the third one with the tune. Do you guys see it?
Yeah.
Okay. Make sure you're on the correct side. I'll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds, and then I'm going to have you guys play it. Okay? Listen to my tempo. ♪ [music] ♪
