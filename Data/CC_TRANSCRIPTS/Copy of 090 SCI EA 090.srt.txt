[teacher] Plug in two. You got it?
[together] We got it.
All right. First question is... Once energy is used up, it's gone for good. Talk to your partner, no! Let's try that one more time folks, eyes up here. What was the rule on the darts?
The rule is don't do anything until you say so.
Thank you. Don't act until I say so. Go! [Background Chatter]
Yeah.
There could be a little bit left of potential. Is that what you mean?
Yeah. Well, [Background Chatter]. [Background Chatter]
All right. On three. I'm going to need eyes up here, please. One, two, th-- Don't flip your card until I tell you to. I shouldn't be able to tell what your card is. It should be much more secret. They're colored, guys, I can tell what they are. Okay! Here we go, on three, hold up your card please. One, two, three! Okay. We've got mostly disagrees. And then we have very one confident... Oh, we disagree. So here's what we're going to do. Put your cards down. I'm calling on Mark first. So where should we be looking?
[together] Mark.
At Mark.
Okay. Okay. So I strongly disagree, because say... So you know you... when you... You know how you eat food, you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running. And then you're out of energy, you're tired, you go to bed, you wake up the next morning, it comes back. You eat more food and it comes back.
Okay. So you're getting it from a different source.
Yeah.
Okay, but that energy you have originally. So that initial energy that you have, and then you ran. Does it go away? Yeah, you have plenty more, but does that original energy go away?
No.
Where does it go? Because you still don't have it, right? You have to eat more food. This is supposed to be challenging. Great job. Who has another idea? Or who can tell me where does it go? It's awfully quiet. Awfully quiet. What do you got?
I don't think it literally... Well, I don't think it goes anywhere. You just... It just keeps making more.
It makes more. So the energy I burnt, right? So I'm running, and I'm running, and I'm running. Where does it go?
Out.
Out where?
To the air.
To the air, in what form?
Breath.
Now this is tricky. This is where it gets tricky. Breath is made of what?
Vapor.
Carbon dioxide.
Water and carbon dioxide. And we call that matter. We call that stuff. Is stuff and energy the same thing?
[together] No.
No, and this is really a tricky idea in Science. So we're going to keep working with you on that. So where does the energy go?
Out into sweat.
Out into... Now, okay, sweat is?
Stuff.
It's stuff, right? But where... So where does the energy go? Does anybody want to change their answer? And say, once it's used up, it's used up for good? Anybody? Some people I think... Now Tatum what do you think?
I think that when you run, it's... Some of the energy go into the ground.
How many people agree with Tatum? That some of that energy is going to go to the ground?
Oh yeah.
[together] Yeah.
Okay. In what form does it go to the ground?
In static stuff.
What's that? I think you said static stuff. Is that what you say?
Yeah.
Okay, so static stuff is... Now this gets really tricky because now we're getting into electrons. But you're thinking about the rubbing, kind of thinking. Is that what you're thinking? How it rubs? And then you shock people? Okay. So that can happen. That's a little more complicated so I'm going to put that on hold for now. But what... So if I'm running, and that energy's going into the ground, somebody said that. Who said that?
[together] Tatum.
Tatum. Okay. So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground. In what form is it going into the ground? Yeah.
Energy transfer.
It is an energy transfer, right? This is going from my foot to the ground. What form is it in? Do you guys know what I mean when I say form?
[together] Yeah.
Yeah. We talked about kinetic, and potential, and heat, and what else we talked about? Elastic, and--
Light.
Gravitational, and light, and chemical.
Sound.
Heat, sound. Ooh, there's just hey, is any of that sound energy?
No.
No?
Maybe it could be sound energy.
Yes! Sound! Because you're... You're stepping hard. You're...
Okay, so if I'm running, I'm probably going to produce some sound. Anything else that could go in there? Jason?
Huh?
Okay, I think that as you step on... You'll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on, you all react to gravity to the ground.
So gravity's pushing down--, now remember what gravitational energy is, is how far it is away from the ground, right? So how much room it has to fall basically. So would there be... If I go like this, would there be any gravitational energy there?
Wouldn't there be if you raise your foot?
Now it's got gravitational.
Here's what we need, I'm really doing something to say... But here's what I want you to think about this one... Actually, let's do this one more time. I want you to re-vote on this. Once energy is used up, it's gone for good. Talk to each other for 10 seconds. [Background Chatter]
You're thinking it's going someplace else.
I don't know where but I don't think it just disappears for good. I think it's going somewhere.
That it's somewhere but just not sure where.
Yeah.
All right folks, we're going to re-vote on three. One, two, three. All right, put your cards down for just a second. Here's what Henry just said, and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry. And we're going to talk about, again guys, we're not getting answers to all these questions today, we will at some point. I promise. We're going to do it in the formal labs but not before I'm through telling you. Henry, tell me what you just said.
I think that it's not gone for good. I'm not sure where it goes but I think it doesn't just leave. It's still somewhere but I don't know where.
How many of you agree with Henry? That you think that it's somewhere but you're just not sure where?
I don't know where though.
All right. Do you know what form?
No.
No. Anybody else? Know where?
But wait. Doesn't it just transform?
It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be...
[together] What?
What kind of energy is it? All right, but here's what we're going to do, we're going to move on to the next one. If a person is pushing a box, the person has energy, but the box does not otherwise it would help out. Ready, set, go. [Background Chatter]
What's the evidence that the box has energy? What form of energy is that, that's moving?
I don't know.
Well, it's kineck, kineck...
One more try.
Kinetic.
Okay. [Background Chatter]
Because it's currently in motion.
Yeah.
Okay. All right. So now here's what I want... We're going do a challenge question. What about the person? What kind of energy does the person have, who's pushing it?
That... I don't know.
You guys all have it? Okay, here we go! Eyes over here please. Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement? All right, here we go. A person is pushing a box, the person has energy but the box does not, otherwise, it would help out. On three, hold up your cards, please. One, two, three. So what you're saying then is you all think the box does have energy, am I correct?
[together] Yeah.
Okay. Chloe tell me why... What is your evidence, that the box has energy?
I think it has energy because when you're pushing it, it has a friction with whatever you're pushing it.
How many of you agree that there's friction there? Because it's rubbing against what?
[together] The ground.
It's rubbing against the ground. There could be some rubbing against you, but most likely it's going to be rubbing against ground. But here's my question, what is your evidence that it has energy? It does have friction, and now it gives you some sort of indication that it's doing what?
[together] Moving.
It's moving. What do we call that, something's moving? What kind of energy does that? Just shout it.
[together] Kinetic.
Kinetic. So it has kinetic energy. So here's my next question, so does anybody disagree? The box does not have kinetic energy? Tate?
I didn't believe it. I thought it was transferred. I thought that it was energy transfer.
[together] Yeah.
Okay. So you think energy's being transferred from the person to the box.
Yeah.
Okay, but the question is still, does the box have energy? Even if I'm transferring it there? Does it have energy while it's moving?
Yeah.
Well, do you mean before the person?
I mean while I'm moving it. I'm in the process of pushing the box. Does the box have energy?
Yeah, but don't you think part of it, would be from you, and part of it--
I think all of it is from you.
Oh.
But does it still have energy?
Yeah.
Yeah, it does. So what's your proof? Chloe just said it. What's your proof that the box has energy?
[together] Friction.
It's moving.
That it's moving. Okay, now the friction is proof that's it's moving, perhaps. But you also see it moving, that would be the proof that it's moving. Okay, so here's my other question, I'm going to make this point, this is too easy for you. We're going to make this more challenging. What about the person pushing the box? So here is me, this is how I push a box. So if I'm pushing the box, what kind of energy do I have? Think about it. Jack, what do you think?
Kinetic.
How many of you agree with Jack, that I have kinetic energy? How many of you think there's something else going on there as well?
No.
So I have... I can only have kinetic energy, right? Because I am... ?
[together] Moving. Pushing.
Because I am moving and I'm pushing. Okay. What other kind of energy must I have?
I have to say something else, like it's kind of helping to [inaudible] and what disagrees. Yesterday, you told us the classic pool...
You're talking about energy transfer? You guys know what she's talking about? We're talking about the pool and handle.
Yeah. I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the [inaudible] because you have the stick in your hand, and you have the energy, potential energy and then you start moving it, and then it's kinetic and it goes through the stick, and through the ball, and it moves.
So you're saying that I have some form of potential energy as well?
Yeah, before you start. And then [inaudible].
In what form is that potential energy? Because I think Emily was about to say this, too. Think about this guys. Where am I getting my energy from? Is it gravitational?
[together] No.
Muscles.
Okay, so I've got my muscles, I've got my body. But where's that energy coming from?
Food.
Which is a form of what, Marcus?
Fuel.
Which is a form of what?
Potential!
Time out. We're asking Marcus. Marcus, what form of potential energy is fuel?
Um.
This is hard. Did you want a lifeline?
Yeah.
Anika, can you help him out.
Chemical.
Chemical, right? Make sense?
[together] Yes.
Okay. All right, we're going on to the next slide. Are you ready?
[together] Yeah.
Woo hoo hoo. Okay, here we go. Now, goodness, gracious. Okay, this is a hard one. Cold moves faster than heat. Ready, set, go. [Background Chatter]
And but also I remember my mom on hot days, she's like, "Don't go upstairs because it's hotter." Heat rises.
So is it, is it move... So your evidence that it's moving faster is that it goes up.
Yeah, and also when you put it in hot, hot water, it's looser because...
Okay, so you're saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well?
[together] Yeah.
Faster than heat? Okay. How about moving in other directions other than up? Is there... Do you have any... ?
Wind!
Okay, so that would... So does one move faster than the other? [Background Chatter] Tatum, what do you think? All right. Think about it. [Background Chatter] All right, here we go. [Background Chatter] Okay, here we go. So on three, hold up your answers please. One, two, three. We've got strongly agrees. We've got an in between. We've got an ooh, we've got a strongly agree. And we've got a couple in-betweens. All right. We're mostly in orange land, we've got one green. So here we go? You ready?
[together] Yeah.
And stand together, you're going to back them up.
Yeah. So, okay, so we agree that. . .
Are you sure?
No. Just kidding.
Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain. So you're a strongly disagree. Okay.
Well, I read it wrong. I thought it said heat... Yeah, I thought it said heat moves faster than cold.
Okay, so tell me why you strongly disagree then, Tim?
Well, because there's just as [inaudible] heat rises. So it has to be lighter to move.
And so it must be moving faster?
Yeah.
How many of you agreed with this... How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing? Interesting. And how many of you... Nope, you guys, it never crossed your mind. Okay. Let's hop to another... Tatum, do have anything else to add to that?
No.
What is your evidence that cold moves slower? Because he was just saying heat was rising, do you have any evidence that cold would move slower? Let's see, Alex, what do you think?
Well, because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules, they move faster when they're hot.
The coke can.
Yeah, the coke can investigation.
Okay, so I'm going to ask them for specific evidence. So what was your specific evidence in the coke can, the hot molec- that they were moving faster?
Well, there was steam coming out of it, and then in the solid, everything's... Molecules in solids are super slow. And then as they move on to liquid then gas, they move faster.
Okay.
And then you need heat to make liquid into gas.
How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold? How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold? So let me ask you a question, and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds, then we might move on, let's see. What is cold? Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold? What is the idea of cold or coldness? Okay, think about it for a second. Ellie, what is cold?
Well, it's like... It could be water that's frozen in... I was thinking that heat moves faster than, than cold because if something was frozen, the molecules wouldn't be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that.
Oh, then it might be [inaudible].
Okay, so she gave me an example of what is cold. But is coldness? So what, what does that even mean? What does that even mean? Anna.
Shivering.
What's that?
Shivering.
Okay, shivering is because you are cold. What is coldness? Okay... [inaudible]
I think it's when the temperature is really low and everything's kind of darkness, when you think of the sun warm, it's really warm, when you have the sun. But it's when you think of something cold, it's... sometimes.
Okay, I want... You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is. Here's what I want to think about... Okay, how to phrase this... Is there a such thing as cold? And if so, how would you define it?
It's a hard question!
Oh!
You got to answer! Get ready to answer! Get ready, and do one quick response and then we're going to put it aside for now, and we're going to move on. Come on, Hunter.
No, because it's just heat that's a... That's just water that can be heated or [Background Chatter].
Heat, heat is cold. Heat is that.
Yeah, it's like...
Heat, that's cold.
Yeah.
Oh.
So it's all just kind of a scale? Like you got hot over here and cold over here, and you're talking about there's less heat over here than there is here?
Heat has cold molecules.
Heat has colder?
All right. So here's what we're going to do, we're going to talk more about this later. We're going to move on to the next question for now. Here we go.
