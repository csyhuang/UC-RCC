[Teacher] That's heavier automatically sink. Hang on one sec. And then, we'll try to work through this one. If something is heavier than something else, will it automatically sink? Are ships heavy? Do ships sink? Occasionally, right? Especially if you're on that cruise ship, like last week, did you hear about that?
[Boy] It depends on the--
[Teacher] Okay, now we're talking about depends what it's in. So, now we've got all these different ideas working. Holy cow. Yes, ma'am, anything else to add?
I was gonna say, I don't know why, I'm just gonna hook on this whole list of things, but, like, a tin can will float if it's empty, because of the air that's stuck inside of it holds the object up. So, if that was hollow, I'm guessing that it would most likely float. So, the ships are hollow in the bottom, the air that keeps it up, but the bottom, how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn't hollow. That part sinks, but the air in the boat will keep it up and that's how things float.
