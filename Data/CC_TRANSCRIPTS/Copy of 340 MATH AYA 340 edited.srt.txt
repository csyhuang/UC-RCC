Okay, so...
[Voiceover] They're equal because of Right Angles Theorem
You are skipping a step. Again. Trevor, tell him the definition of an altitude. You tell me I have an altitude. You have to tell me then what's the consequence of an altitude. Read the definition of an altitude. Say it.
The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle. I don't know how to word that right,  but...
Somebody help him out. He's making sense, but somebody...  Yes.
Alright. It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly, if that's a word.
Don't say through because an altitude is bounded. It starts at a vertex and it goes... Okay, so! Now, Isaac, What should be the consequent step two there?
[Isaac] Right here?
Yes. Whatever they gave you in those definitions, Trevor's and the improved definition by Trey, nobody said anything about congruent angles. What did we talk?
[Student] That they're both right angles.
[Isaac] That they're right angles.
No, we didn't.
That BD is perpendicular to AC.
Ah-ha!
That's what I got.
Nice. That's what it is. So, just write on top of that, honey.
[Isaac] Right here?
Yeah, the step two, you should have that. Right? You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that's what reason says. It comes from a defintion.
[Isaac] And why is that  because of...
Tell him. Why is that?
Definition of altitude.
Definition of altitude. [No dialogue]
Okay. You see how when we were working with the picture, we put those boxes on the triangle. What did those boxes say, indicate?
[Isaac] That they're right angles.
They're right angles, okay. So, that should be... And why do we have right angles? Somebody tell me. Why do we have right angles?
Definition of perpendicular lines.
Yes. That's a consequence if you have perpendicular lines.
[Isaac] So, I'm going to write, ADB and CDB are right angles?
[Student] Yes.
[Student] Yeah.
Okay. [No dialogue]
[Teacher] You guys, the rest of you might have started with the fact that it's an angle bisector, right?
[Student] Yeah.
[Student] Yeah.
And that's okay if you started with that. It's okay. Doesn't matter. You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD. You don't have to start with a given, but that's traditionally the way we do it. [No dialogue]
I can't believe I got this. It's because of...
[Students] It's the definition of perpendicular lines. [No dialogue]
[Isaac] What's this?
Okay, wait. Breathe in and out. Now, let's go see what's going on. Okay, step to the side. ADB and CDB. Okay. Still, you need to have an angle, a side, and an angle. Do you have a congruent angle? After all that work.
[Isaac] I'm going to do that now.
Okay, what are you going to put?
[Isaac] Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles.
[Student] Nope!
[Student] Right Angle Congruency
[Isaac] Right Angle Congruency Theory.
Well, I haven't...
What is the definition of right angle?
That all right angles are congruent.
What's the definition of a right angle?
90 degrees
It measures 90 degrees
Yeah, yeah. All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he's writing. [No dialogue] Okay, let's see what we have. If you would number them, that would help. That's one. And what's the consequence for after one?
[Isaac] I'm trying. [No dialogue] I am old and somewhat blind from here. But I know... Is that a "2" right under that? At the perpendicular line, you have "2". What is that?
[Isaac] AD is perpendic...
No, after that.
[Isaac] Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB.
Wait. He wrote it.
[Isaac] It's all jumbled up and it's all there, so...
But, wait a minute. Let's make sense out of this because it has to flow, okay? You know when you have your perpendicular line, What should be at the  perpendicular line? The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines, is what?
[Isaac] That the angles are...
Somebody, somebody
[Students] That they're right angles.
[Isaac] I want to say that,  but then-- (Laughter) I just don't want to say  something that's wrong
No, you're fine. You were not here yesterday. And it seems you're doing great. Hey, so, take the blue marker, so that everybody can see. Take the blue marker because I would like to re-number it so they can see it, okay? So, re-number them again. One is the given, the altitude.
[Isaac] So, you want me  to write over?
Yes. And then that's two.  Now, what should be three? Don't put three on that one. What should be three? Somebody tell him.  What should be three?
The angles.
The right angles.
Yes.
Okay, now, honey, after you have right angles, what are you going to say?
[Isaac] That, uh, Definition of Right Angle Theorem.
No.
Okay, so right angles. What happens after right angles? Because remember angles are angles. I need to talk about angle congruency. But, you haven't said that. You talked about right angles. So now, what are you going to say? You have it there, honey.
[Isaac] Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE.
Okay, so that should be the next step.
[Isaac] That's four.
Okay, you remember. Good. Great. Remember when I asked you at the beginning, when we first started doing proofs, to keep track. So, you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle?
[Isaac] Yeah, right here.
Not yet, we haven't touched that guy yet. We don't even have a number for that guy. He's just floating in there. What angle is congruent to what angle? Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle?
[Isaac] Yeah, ADB is--
You just did right?
Okay, go cross out one of the As. I don't think you specifically did this, but I've noticed that some of you. I've noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you. Taylor, that you were always... After you prove something, you found it within your proof. You would kind of cross it out in here. Okay, I found this. Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here. It's like you're taking attendance. I need angle for an angle. I already have an angle. Keeping going. See what I'm doing here. I showed you this way back. Yeah.
He's probably getting confused because of number three. How he put ADB-- because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB.
[Isaac] Wait, what, what, what?
Number three. The original number three.
[Isaac] Yeah
The B should be in the middle instead of D.
It should be ABD and DBC.
That's right.
[Student] That's why!
[Student] That's why! Yeah!
[Student] I didn't noticed that.
[Student] Yeah, I thought he put that.
[Isaac] You guys are smart. Yeah, that's how you got confused with everything else. Okay, so now, segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property, so that's another side. And then it's given that BD is an angle bisector, so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD
[Teacher] Okay, but the issue here is he hasn't listed that as a given, right? Just like people say, "Well, you're making that up. "How do you know that?" And you just say, "It's given," but you didn't write it, --
Yeah, he did.
Yeah, yeah he did.
It's right there.
It's number four.
[Student] He just did it wrong.
[Student] It's backwards.
[Student] It's all there.
[Teacher] So, that should be step... Wait a minute. One, two, three... four, five...
Four should be one
[Student] Whoa.
Three should be two
One should be...
[Isaac] So, there's a one, two, three, four... and then five... Wait, five, right here.
[Student] Six right above it.
[Isaac] six, seven.
[Teacher] Okay, can you change the numbers?
[Student] Fix the numbers.
[Teacher] Yeah, please fix the numbers.
[Isaac] It's there.
Okay, we got it. We have an angle bisector, the consequence of an angle bisector. We have an altitude, the consequence of an altitude. We have reflexive property, so do you have them all?
[Isaac] Yeah.
So, what could you say now? The triangle... I'm going back to the black marker... [Classroom chatter] [No dialogue] Okay, let's get him out of the hot seat, okay? Micah! Yes, Micah. You tell us, is he finished with the proof?
No.
Why?
Because you said no.
Who said no?
You.
But okay, you're supposed to tell me if there's something.
Well, you have to put that... it is the... I don't know.
Frank to the rescue!
He hasn't proved that it's isosceles yet.
And how do you prove that it's isosceles?
I don't really know.
That sounded so tough, Frank.
Yes.
Okay, you say, segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C... Wait, how do you say it?
CPCTC.
Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent.
I always mess it up!
I can't do the CPC...  I can't do that. I say the whole thing. [Background chatter] Okay, now, Frank, is he finished?
[Student] I think.
[Teacher] Is he?
[Student] No.
[Student] Not yet.
[Teacher] No, he's not. Okay, why? Tell him why.
Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent, then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC.
So what should be his number 10?
Triangle ABC is isosceles. And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle. Yes!
[Student] I'm so proud.
It keeps getting better. I told you it would get better.
[Student] Teamwork.
[Student] I was stressing last night because I was like, it's so hard.
[Isaac] Okay, you guys understand what this means, but I'm trying to hurry it.
[Student] Good job, Isaac.
[Student] Yeah, Isaac, a good job.
Very good, Isaac! One big clap for Isaac, one, two, three (One clap from everyone)
Alright!
Yeah!
You did good! (Laughter) Okay, so. You know what?
This is the proof, that the new program where I give you... because I want to make sure you get it... enough information to do this on our own, okay? And then, I'm not going to  write it out. We're going to talk about how to do it. And then you're going to complete it tonight at home. So, what do we need to do? What is given there? Jonathan. What's given?
The middle one?
[Teacher] This one, honey.
CB is an angle bisector of ACB. CD is an angle bisector of ACB.
[Teacher] Okay, what does that give you? Once you have an angle bisector? No, that's not it. Don't look at that one. That's a totally different proof. This is one that I'm going to give you tonight. So, what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean?
