[Teacher] Trying to find meaning for their lives, or were they just trying to, what were they questing for, do you think?
[Blonde girl] Well, Gilgamesh was questing for like immortality, and that was for him, and not really his people, but Theseus I think was, I don't know.
[Girl with short hair] I think Theseus was just trying to help the people of Athens. I don't think either of them were really looking to find that, but they both ended up finding it.
[Girl in green] I think both of them were like looking to help their people, and then I also think like a small part of them was looking for glory.
[Girl in white] I think it's kind  of like looking for their destiny, like they know they're meant for something bigger, but they don't know what it is yet, so they're just looking for what that is, so....
[Haley] Then he goes to take the test, and the test kills him. Or not. Then, he goes back to his father, and he realizes that he's just like, you know, the father's really disappointed in the son, and then he's really disappointed until the son, I think it could happen in today's society. I don't know about Gilgamesh.
[Girl in red shirt] Well yeah, it  was a really like--
[Haley] Abstract, connecting--
[Girl in red shirt] In the really broad sense, it could happen, but like --
[Haley] Like the story line.
[Girl in red shirt] But when you  look at details, then like, no.
[Haley] But I mean, minotaurs don't exist. So it probably couldn't happen.
[Girl in red shirt] But like you  were saying, like metaphorically, it could be something, that, you know.
[Haley] Like the storyline could happen.
[Boy in blue] But metaphorically, you could compare anything.
[Girl in white shirt] That's true.
[Teacher] Can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically?
[Girl in red shirt] Like me.
[Girl with bangs] No, the  only one was like (Background Chatter)
[Teacher] You mean hypothetical.
[Girl with bangs] Theseus, not like he goes and fights a minotaur, and when he comes back, he's like not dead, but his dad thinks he's dead and kills himself. But it's like Haley said, I guess.
[Haley] Thanks!
[Girl with bangs] If you have like a test, and like you're bad--
[Girl in red shirt] Like a difficult situation  in general.
[Girl with bangs] Yeah, and like your dad or parents or someone are like, "You can get through this," like, "You can beat it," and they think that you, or like they think that you fail it, or like catastrophe fail it, or they think you do, then they're gonna be kind of disappointed in you, but like they're not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test.
[Haley] But still.
[Teacher] You can laugh if it was someone else.
[Haley] But maybe like on the inside, he's dying.
[Girl with bangs] Yeah.
[Haley] Your turn.
[Girl in red shirt] Okay, I just said, what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times?
[Haley] Well, the--
[Girl in white shirt] Probably the  whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed.
[Girl in red shirt] At least like  in the... to the culture, like the gods and goddesses aren't like a, you know--
[Girl with bangs] Big deal?
[Girl in red shirt] Yeah.
[Haley] I think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are, not like in charge, but that are higher up in our society, like the government people, and like parents and--
[Girl in red shirt] I just think  more like mentors, in general.
[Haley] Yeah, like people that are higher than us.
[Girl in red shirt] Like anyone  technically could like, you know, that you look up to, that you rely on for help.
[Haley] It's like a figure, rather than like-- - Yeah.
[Girl in red shirt] A physical--
[Haley] Yeah, god.
[Girl in red shirt] God. Yeah.
[Haley] Well my question was, show the similarities and differences between Theseus and his father.
[Girl in white shirt] Ooh, okay. So, I think like they both kind of, they're very different in their terms of like loss and like failure. Because like when Theseus's dad like thought that he was like dead, then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide. But when like Theseus like was with Ariadne or whatever, and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur, then he just kind of, you know, left her on an island.
[Haley] I think that, I don't really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on Crete seven maidens and seven children, but like, I just think that because that happens, and because he does that every year, I think Theseus is a better leader, he's just like better in charge of--
[Girl with bangs] I think that they're  definitely like different rulers, too. Because like Theseus is more, like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against Thebes, but doesn't try to like-- most people would like try to steal stuff from the city, but he's just going to like bury the dead, and then he leaves. So like that's more of a nicer leader I guess, whereas his dad wasn't really like put in that situation, but I'm guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city, and not include people very often.
[Haley] It says that (Background Chatter)
[Girl in gray] Because he lived  with his mom, so he didn't want to have a son. So then when he could lift the rock, then he could come over and meet his dad.
[Boy on far right] Is this question number--
[Girl in brown] No, we're still asking, predict what would happen if King Aegeus and Enkidu hadn't died.
[Girl in dark jacket] If the king hadn't died, I think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after, and there would have been no like--
[Girl in brown](Background Chatter)
not formed, you know what I'm talking about? Because King Aegeus--
[Girl in gray] No, but he  would have died sometime, and then Theseus would have taken over.
[Girl in brown] Yeah, that's true.
[Teacher] Can you go, dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy? What did you mean by that?
[Girl in brown] Oh, just like  right when King Aegeus died, Theseus came over and said, "We're going to have a democracy "instead of me ruling over all of you." So like, we don't know if that would have happened, or because if he just would have stayed alive, he could have like changed Theseus' mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea.
[Teacher] Mm-hmm.
[Girl in brown] Yeah. He would've wanted him to be-- he would have that as king. He would've been more like his dad.
[Girl in dark jacket] Yeah, that's true.
[Girl in gray] But if Enkidu didn't die, then Gilgamesh would probably like be happy, and then like, conquer a bunch of other stuff, and like they would probably like die together.
[Boy in crew cut] She could have sent him to Athens to claim him as his--
[Girl in brown](Background Chatter)
[Boy in crew cut] Oh, okay, nevermind.
[Boy on far right] You're allowed to go on.
[Boy in crew cut] All right.
[Girl in dark jacket] No, if Enkidu didn't die, though, I just think that Gilgamesh wouldn't have really known-- like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning? I think he still was kind of arrogant, until Enkidu died, so he--
[Girl] He would have stayed like that.
[Girl in brown] Yeah, he would have stayed that way.
[Girl in brown] Mm-hmm. Because he went through like a stage of depression, so.
[Girl in dark jacket] Yeah.
[Teacher] Do you think that each one reached humility at the end, or no? Do you think that Gilgamesh, you said, was still arrogant, even at the end?
[Girl in dark jacket] No.
[Teacher] Oh, he wasn't?
[Girl in dark jacket] Not after Enkidu died, but once he died, it stopped of course, but--
[Boy with crew cut] I think Gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn't going to be immortal.
[Girl in brown jacket] Well yeah, that, too. Because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn't live forever. He couldn't do whatever he wanted.
[Girl in dark jacket] Who's your favorite character between each story? Out of the stories?
[Girl in brown] Theseus.
[Girl in dark jacket] Yeah, I like Theseus, too.
[Boy in crew cut] We all like Theseus.
[Boy on far right] Yeah.
[Boy in white] It also said that Theseus was grieving.
[Girl in maroon] Was grieving her loss, or his father's loss?
[Boy in white] It was both.
[Girl in white] Debate which character  had more impact on their society.
[Teacher] Can you say that one more time?
[Girl in white] Debate which character  had more impact on their society.
[Teacher] Oh, she has the "debate" word in there. Okay, let's hear it.
[Boy in yellow] I'd say Gilgamesh--
[Girl in gray] I would say--
[Boy in yellow] ...he wants to be king.
[Teacher] Let's let him finish his reason. What's your reason? You think who?
[Boy in yellow] I think Gilgamesh. Actually, I think Theseus would, because he changed the kind of structure of government, and made it democratic. That's it.
[Girl in maroon] Yeah, I would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived, while kind of Gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered, and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story. While Theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind. That people remembered on high, rather than as like a low point of their society.
[Teacher] Weren't you going to say something?
[Girl in gray] Oh, I was?
[Teacher] I thought you were.
[Girl in gray] I think Theseus was, had an impact.
[Teacher] And the reason for that?
[Girl in gray] Because he like survived more than Gilgamesh did, and he helped people out of the maze, with Adrian's help, right? Yeah. Predict what would happen if the King and Enkidu didn't die.
[Girl in maroon] Well--
[Boy in blue] I don't think  Athens would be democratic. I don't think the king would have done it.
[Girl in maroon] Yeah, he probably would have been poisoned.
[Teacher] Why is that?
[Boy in yellow] Gilgamesh--
[Boy in blue] I don't know, because--
[Boy in yellow] Gilgamesh probably wouldn't have been searching for immortality.
[Girl in maroon] Yeah, he wouldn't have gone on that Journey.
[Boy in yellow] Yeah.
[Girl in maroon] Okay, well my question is: how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through?
[Girl in gray] Wait, what was the question?
[Girl in maroon] How would you have handled the situations?
[Teacher] Wouldn't have done any of them?
[Girl in gray] No, I get scared  really easily, and stressed, so that would not be good.
[Boy in yellow] (mumbles) the Labyrinth thing.
[Teacher] Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.
[Boy in yellow] I wouldn't go to  the Labyrinth thing.
[Teacher] Why is that?
[Boy in yellow] It kind of sounds like a bad idea.
[Girl in maroon] I might go and  just not defeat the beast, and in the first place, I probably would have traveled by water, and not just said, "I'm too good for that, it's too easy." Because, I--
[Boy in yellow] Bandits have sharp swords.
[Girl in maroon] Yeah.
[Girl in gray] Okay, what's yours?
[Boy in black] Choose your favorite character and explain why. From, because you like Gilgamesh or Theseus.
[Girl in gray] Okay. Oh, not like our favorite character, just in the story?
[Boy in black] Yeah. Well either way, it doesn't really matter.
[Girl in gray] Well because my  favorite character from Gilgamesh was Enkidu? Is that how you say it? Because I think he like really changed Gilgamesh for the better. And helped him and humbled him.
[Teacher] Do you agree with that?
[Girl in green] Yeah, I agree with that, because I feel like he was kind of-- like Gilgamesh was so awful, and like Enkidu came in and just changed all that. Plus, I thought that it was kind of cool, his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy. Yeah.
[Girl with short hair] I don't think that Enkidu really meant to change Gilgamesh, though, I think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen.
[Girl in green] Enkidu's mom kind of made that happen, too, didn't he?
[Teacher] Did you feel like Enkidu was just kind of created, that he, I mean we were saying that we like him, but did he seem real to you, or was he just something created?
[Girl white] See, when I read it, the entire time, he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix Gilgamesh, so he didn't really have that much of a personality to me, so that's my opinion, I don't know.
[Girl in green] Yeah, he seemed  like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out Gilgamesh.
[Girl with short hair] And he did.
[Girl in green] Yeah, he did.
[Boy in black] My favorite character  from these stories was Ariadne.
[Teacher] Oh.
[Boy in black] Well, because I  didn't feel sorry for her, because she helped Theseus, and like without her, he would have been trapped in the Labyrinth. But then to repay her, he just ditched her on an island, and just left her, so that wasn't very nice. So I feel sorry for her, that's why.
[Girl in gray] Okay, mine is: how would you have dealt with these situations in (mumbles)
[Teacher] Can you repeat it one more time?
[Girl in gray] How would you have  handled these situa-- (audio cuts out)
[Girl in green] I wouldn't run away from the-- (audio cuts out)
[Girl in green] I would not have gone  on this journey. I probably just would have stayed home, not gonna lie.
[Teacher] Do you feel like, that people, to be great, have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements, that that's what greatness is?
[Students] Not necessarily.
[Girl in white] I don't think you necessarily have to seek them. It all really depends on what your definition of greatness is.
[Girl in green] I feel like to get that like glory and all that, I mean, I think you can do that, if you have enough impact where you are, you don't need to go off on a journey.
[Teacher] What do you think, Dinesh?
[Girl with short hair] I don't know, I feel like, if we're going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories, that obviously you don't have to, I don't think you have to seek greatness, necessarily, I don't think you have to seek it to find it, but I think that you do have to go off, if you're just going to stay where you are, you're not really going to be able to achieve it.
[Teacher] So if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by, that's not greatness. That can't constitute--
