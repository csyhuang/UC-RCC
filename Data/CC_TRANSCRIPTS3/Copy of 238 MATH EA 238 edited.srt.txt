Okay, guys. I see we'll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication. Okay, so can you read the objective with me please? So, I ...
I will be able to do fraction multiplication.
Okay. I've also put it in Spanish just in case that helps you. Okay, so the first thing I want to discuss with you today, is, what do you think about that? Do you agree or disagree? And then, why? So, one-half, does one-half equal one-half? Why or why not? And then, give me some examples. Okay, Raul.
It's becuase it is one-half. They're the same.
Okay.  Abraham.
It's like you cut a pear in half, it's gonna be in equal parts.
Okay, so you guys are saying it's equal?
Yes. 
Okay. What do you think? Eddie believes he thinks the same thing. Taleah, what do you think?
I think it's the same.
You think it's the same? Does everyone think it's the same?
I do.
Until you think, why wouldn't it be the same.
Okay, so Jose is saying why wouldn't they be the same. Okay, so one thing Jose says is he's trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn't be the same. Joe.
It's not the same because 
No, that's just the board point.
Is there a times?
Nope, it's just one over two equals one over two.
I was thinking it was a half times a half.
Okay, so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it's the same. Right?
Yeah.
So now, how do you explain to me why you think it's the same? Why you think it's the same? Joe?
Because they have equal parts.
Okay. Equal parts. What do you mean by equal parts?
They have the same fraction.
Okay. Jose.
They're both practically the same thing.
What do you mean by practically the same thing?
That once you cut a square in half, you have equal parts, and they're gonna be the same thing.
Okay. Who is someone we haven't heard from? Madeline, what do you think? So I heard you say they are the same, right?
Yeah.
So why do you think they are the same?
'Cause they're both equal parts and the same 'cause half equals a half.
Okay. Antonio, what do you think? Think it's the same? So, sounds like we're all thinking it's the same, okay. Abraham, what do you think?
I think they equal the same thing.
Equals the same thing. Okay, so now let's take a look at ... maybe, 'cause it sounds like we're all on the same path here. So let's take a look at something else. Are they really the same? Is that half of a ...
Cookie.
Cookie. Half of a cookie. Half a ...
Pizza.
Are they the same?
No.
Yes.
One at a time, 'cause I'm hearing a lot of good stuff, but you guys are all saying it at the same time. Okay. Miguel.
They're the same, 'cause if they weren't,  the same is just half.
So I'm hearing, they're the same, but one's bigger than the other one, 'cause one's a pizza and one's a cookie.
Yeah.
Tina, you're kind of shaking your head. What do you think about that?
I think they're both the same, 'cause they're still one-half they are just different size.
Victoria, what do you think? Same or not the same?
Same 'cause it's still half.
Okay, so let me ask you this: I'm hearing a couple things, and it's kind of contradicting itself. Meaning you're saying one thing, but you're also saying the opposite. Like I heard it's the same because it's one-half, but it's different because it's ..
Different sizes?
different sizes. You just told me it's the same, but now you're telling me it's different sizes. 
They are both fattening!
Oh, cookies and pizza are both fattening? Okay. Felice.
Why I think they're still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it's big or small because it's still chopped in half.
Okay. So if a half of a half, so would you rather have half of $10, or half of $100?
Half of a $100!
Why?
Because it's bigger!
Because it's bigger. But I thought it was the same?
No.
No, 'cause it's the same thing.
It's still half, but you're commenting, half of a hundred ...
It has to be the same thing. Like the pizza, a whole pizza, and you cut it in half.
Okay, you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen?
For it to be half.
For it to be half. But here, it's not the same thing. You're saying to me that it is equal. So which is it? 
So now you're saying you don't think they're the same.
No. You get more pieces than a cookie.
They're still the same.
They're still half.
Okay, so who still agrees that the one-half equals one-half? Raise your hand. Okay. Alright now, who says that one-half maybe, sometimes doesn't equal one-half? Okay. So we got a couple. Alright. So, Delphina, what's your thinking? I haven't heard from you. What's your thinking?
I think it depends on what you are looking at.
So, in case you didn't hear her, Delphina said it depends, okay. Hear what she said? It depends on what you're looking at. 'Cause she said with the money example, that you guys, well all of you unanimously, chose half of a hundred, that's $50, as opposed to $5, half of $10. So it does matter. So now we just go back to the question, does one-half equal one-half? Okay, Raul?
I think one-half equals one-half. I think it's still the same. It's not talking about how big it is, it's just talking about a half.
But it didn't say in the question what it was. I think the question is supposed to say what it was  to say if it's the same or not.
Okay, so what Dallas is saying, what Dallas is saying, that it needs to tell you what one-half is. 'Cause she's saying here, the previous question just had the number, one over two, one over two. Equal. Alright, here, she's saying well all of a sudden yeah, the numbers are gone, but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie. So now it's not the same.
But it's the same question. What Dallas is saying, in the question it should tell you what is it.
It's actually like 10 fives ... five-tenths and and one-half.
So what do you think? What's your final thought as far as one-half equals one-half? What's your final thought?
They're still the same, it's a half.
It's still the same ...
because it's half.
Okay.
It's the same and different.
It's the same and different. Miguel.
 and they tell you it's different.
Okay, so, good question. Good question. I like the look of that. Yes.
If they are, are they the same? They're the same, it's one-half or something. One is bigger than the other one.
Okay. Rodrigo. What about you, bud? What's your thoughts on this?
I'm still thinking.
You're still thinking? Or are you still, will you compete?
I'm still basically undecided.
Okay.  You think they're basically the same? So, you added that 'basically'. Why don't you just put they're the same? Why did you put 'basically'?
Because one's bigger than the other.
It will obviously still be different. Where we're going with this is, you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is. Your whole unit. Okay? Alright? So that's why sometimes you have to be careful, what it's asking you to do. Okay? Let's go on to the next one. Okay, so what does one-half look like to you? So just think right now in your head, when you think of one-half, okay? What do you see?
Half a dollar.
Half of a dollar.
Half a fifty.
Half a fifty.
Half a gallon of juice.
Half a gallon of juice.
Half a body.
Half of a body. Half of a cake.
Half of a cake. Okay, Guadalupe, what do you see?
Half a paper.
Half a paper, okay. So let me take it to the next step. So what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice. Does it make sense?
No.
Does it make sense?
No!
It doesn't make sense. So we have to make sure that we know what?
You have to make sense.
Well, it makes sense, but how is it gonna make sense? It's what?
If they're the same.
If they're the same. But what's the same?
The object!
The object, or the whole unit, right? Like, what is it we're talking about? We talking about pizza? We talking about cookies?
Paper.
Paper. Juice.
People.
People.
Eggs.
Alright, so the other thing I wanna talk to you about is, does multiplication always make things larger? Bigger?
Yes!
No!
So I heard yes, yes, yes and then ...
No.
So now then, what?
'Cause sometimes it makes it smaller. If you do nine times one, it's gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero, it makes it zero.
Jessie. Did you hear her example?
No.
Okay, so what she said was, 'cause it's important. I want you to make sure you understood. She said that no, because nine times one is nine. Then when you go nine times zero, it's zero. So it actually made it less, right? What do you think though? When you multiply in general, when you multiply, does it make things larger? When you multiply two things together?
Yes.
Okay. Abraham
It gets bigger, because like six times two, it's 12, and it gets bigger.
Okay.  Raul, what do you think? Raul V. When you multiply, does it always get bigger?
It depends on the number.
What?
It depends on the number.
It depends on the number so give me an example.
Zero times 8100, is gonna be zero.
Okay. So can we ... so I'm hearing kind of like, a lot of you are saying yes, it makes it larger. But there's still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always. Like if we go back to, if we go back to that one-half, if we go back to that one-half and that dollar. Gino, what's 100 times one-half?
Times one-half is ... a hundred and a half?
A hundred and a half?
50?
50. I got 150.
150? Taylor, do you agree? One hundred times one-half is 150? Raul B.
500?
Five hundred? How'd you get five hundred?
I thought it was half of a thousand.
A hundred though. No more thousand, one hundred. One hundred times one-half.
Is it 110? Half of 10 is five.  Half of 10 is five.
So what is your answer? The one hundred times one-half?
Five hundred.
Five hundred? Okay, so one hundred times one-half is five hundred? Tina?
We don't know because we don't know what one-half equals.
Okay, so Tina's saying now, you don't know what the one-half is. What if we're just talking about numbers? One hundred times one-half, what would that be? One hundred times one-half.  Let's say it's money. A hundred dollars times one-half. 
It could be five or 50. If we're talking about $100, then it's gonna be one-half of $100 is 35.
Okay, so,
45. there was a lot of people talking, so you couldn't hear, but Louis is saying it depends, but if you're talking about money, if it was hundred dollars times one-half, it'd be half of $100, which is $50. Let's take that example. One hundred times one-half is 50. So then when we multiply that, did it get larger?
No.
Yeah.
It got smaller. Didn't it? You start with a hundred, and you multiply and you got 50, which is less. So what do you think now? Do you think it always makes things bigger?
No.
Sometimes it makes it smaller.
So, let's ... can you give me another example then? That's just ... make sure we prove it. Is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then?
Like five times four?
Five times four? We start with five times four, you get what?
20. It's a bigger number.
Okay, so that's if you multiply it times a half, right?
Ten times one-half?
Ten times one-half would be?
Five.
Raise your hand if you think it doesn't always make it bigger. It depends on what you multiply it by. Alright. Very good. So, we're gonna use the area model to show one-half times one-half.
That's a whole.
One-half times one-half Abraham says it's a whole, but let's go ahead and ... let's take a look. I'm gonna go ahead and shade in one-half, okay. And then we'll take a look to see what it actually equals. Here's a half. There's a half. How many squares are shaded both colors?
One.
Two.
One out of how many total?
Four.
One-fourth. So, one-half times one-half is one-fourth. Is one fourth smaller than one-half?
Yes.
That's another proof that when you multiply, it doesn't always get bigger.
You could make it into money. Like one-fourth is 25 cents.
Alright, very good.
A hundred divided by...
So, let's take a look at another example. If we're to use an area models for this, what would that look like?
Three-fourth. It'd be one-half, right? We'd see one-half times one-fourth. So what do you think?
Half of a fourth? One-eighth?
Half of a fourth, which is one eighth, he said. One-half of one-fourth is one-eighth, do you agree?
Yeah.
Okay.
