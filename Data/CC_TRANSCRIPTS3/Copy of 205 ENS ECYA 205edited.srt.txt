 Okay.
 What's the next one, Zach?
 
 Jen, you can put on a 50-line poem on that one here if you wanted to.
 I got that.
 You have 
 Okay what was the main? What was the summary?
 What would be a good summary sentence?
 
 Well, they competed in a game known as the Memoriad.
Uh huh. You guys had that one, don't you? You have the names and faces there. That was great.
 The game. 
 Are you doing the vocab though?
 No.
 Okay.
 So wait, hang on. Should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words?
 You can just do anything from that article. The pictures were just to get you thinking about it. That's why we did the words. And the vocab was just to help us understand. So it doesn't have to go off the vocab. But the vocab kind of connects with an idea. So it may kind of work out that way. You'll have to let Zach see, because you took what he had, which is great, and you added to it.
 Do we put the name of the movie?
 I'm doing . It's a song. The croak part is a song.
Mm-hmm, that was part of the.
 Okay, I was getting.
 There, there's the song.
 
 I was stuck on the reading one too.
 Got one left.
Zach, what's the text structure?
Sharpening his pencil.  Just go like that.
 So was the Puppet in 1970? Or was it?
Yep, 1970.
 That must have been old.
1968 is when the Yellow Submarine came out. Yep.
 
All right. Do you guys want to put your pyramid up there? Zach, do you want to help do that? Do you agree that he was right on the text structure?
 Yeah.
See if you can build it. I tried to size it just about right, as close as I could get. So it should fit in there pretty good.
 I don't think it's sized up very well.
 What? I just got it as close as I could, Zach. It may not be 100% perfect. And then the person that didn't read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers.
 That means we got to do another one.
You each got a chance to read.
 Yeah, that's the tone one.
We need one more detail. Did I make it a little too big, or is it pretty close?
 It's a little long.
 Could be a little long, huh? Had a little extra at the bottom. Next time I'll shrink it up just a little bit.
 We still have one more.
That's fine. And who read it? Was it Zach?
 
We'll let Zach read those when the girls get done.
 Okay. Do I read the summary?
 Do you just want me to read? I don't know if he knows.
 Start with the details.
 Memoriad is an unforgettable competition. Memoriad games is memorize 50-line poems. People compete in the games called Memoriad. The game is to memorize it.  Memorize names and faces and memorize a 50-line poem.
Very good. And what was your text structure?
 Description.
Description, because they were describing all about 
  He just talked.
He did the talking, you did the writing. Somebody gave you ideas.
Kinda maybe.
It was a good partnership. The girls are just about done. We'll let them read theirs. And then we'll do our Jeopardy.
 Can we tape the Jeopardy game?
Mm-hmm, yep.
 We have the same people in Jeopardy that were in here.
Yes, it is the same group. Okay, let's not have a sword fight right now. She has one more task there. She's got it all grammatically correct.
 Okay. 
Let's just, Judy over here.
 Do you mind if it's off to the side?
 There's another one.
There's two of them. Oh, did it fall off? Well, we can put a little piece of tape over it. Oh, here it is. There you go, that should hold it up good. All right, see if you agree with what the girls have here. Are you listening, Zach? Got a pyramid all set up.
 Our text structure is, wait, do I start at the bottom?
Start at the bottom, and the details kind of add to the summary.
  The movie they were talking about was the Yellow Submarine, starring. Is it starring or staring?
Starring, I bet.
 Starring the Beatles.
 The Beatles, okay. Their song called Being Green was made in 1970. Summary, the television was made in 1953. Kermit was in 1970. Stoplight was made in 1920. They all had one thing in common. They were in a color.
Very good. I love that last sentence. They all have that in common, they're in color.
 Text structure is sequence.
Sequence because?
It tells the order of them.
All the years, very good. Okay, one of you guys go grab a marker board, one from each team. And I'll go get Jeopardy. And you'll need a marker to write on the marker board. I will pull the screen down. All right, Zach, Zach.
 Where are the markers?
 You can grab one back there. There's one up here. As long as you got one or two for your group, you can take turns. Now, these questions I think will flow pretty well today.
 Whoa, I can't even see it. I think the yellow is better. I know with the lights on, it's a little harder, but it helps to have the lights on.
 Did we run review?
 What?
 Did we run review?
 
 Text structure!
 My music didn't come on.
 Confucius says! Vocab. Text features.
 Features. Thank you, Zach. Yes, they're different.
 Confucius says?
 Yeah. Okay who started first last time? Was it the guys?
 Yeah.
 Okay, we'll let the gals start today.
 So do I do text structure?
 Oh, you're gonna win.
 Text structure 500.
 Text structure 500.
 Yeah, what's the "Confucius Says"?
 We had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit, they were little sayings, and you decide just which text structure they go with.
 So that might go with text structure.
 Yes, it'll be a text structure question, yeah.
 
 Is that what you guys wanted was text structure, right?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 In our state, dams have been built
 Zach.
 on many rivers. These dams are used to product electricity we need. But they also create problems.
 Scoot your chair closer to your partner. Scoot your chair back.
 Prevents the other wildlife near the rivers. Therefore, we should not build any more dams. Instead, we should use solar energy, or energy from the sun, to produce electricity. This will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us.
 Hmm, which of the five text structures?
 We think it's problem solution.
 Problem solution, correct. Give yourself 500 points
 Because it said problem in there.
 All right, what would the guys like? Hey.
 Sorry. Zach, what do you want?
 They did text structure 500. It'll pop up yellow after I click on the next one.
 Vocab for 500.
 Vocab for 500. Want to read that one, Zach?
You should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response.
 Hmm, what does ponder mean?
 You think.
 Ahh, perfect. To think about. Give yourself 500 points. All right, what would the gals like?
 Should we try the Confucius question?
 Yeah.

 This is one of the five text structures.

 Index would be correct. Good job, guys. What would the gals like?
 Oh, 500.
 Yeah, I just did that 500.
 Should we text features for 400?
 400, okay. All right, Judy can read this one.
 What text feature gives definition for vocabulary words?
 Wait, what is it? Wait.
 Yeah, what do you mean for that?
 Oh, I didn't, that one doesn't have the choices like the other one did. It would be an index, a glossary, or a title.
 Glossary.
 Glossary is correct. I put the choices on the other ones. I just must have missed that one. Very good. All right
 Confucius says for 400.
 Confucius says for 400. Could you go for Mrs. Lloyd's for just a couple minutes? Okay.
 I wanna go tell Mr. Debush.

 It's Zach's.
 Zach's turn? Okay.

 Yeah.
 Okay, all right.
Oh man, basketball.
 Whose turn to read?
 Confucius says, "Net in soccer "is much larger than net in basketball."
 Compare and.
 Yeah, compare and contrast.

 You want to do vocab for 400?
 Vocab for 400.
Yeah, vocab.
 Vocab for 400? Okay.
 Many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs.
 Very good. Just a second. What do you think?
 First players.
 Okay, the first players. You're exactly right.
Oh, my gosh.

 Structure.
 Yeah.
 Structure 400?
 Yeah.
 They want the big point ones.
 Is it my turn?
 Yeah, I think so.
 Living in the country is very different than living in the city. A city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people. In the country, there are fewer cars and people. In the city, many people can walk to the movies, stores, and other activities. In the country, people must drive to get to places.
 Compare and contrast.

Drained?
 Drained, yep. Empty, gone, you used all your savings. And basketball shoes can cost a lot of money, so I can see that happening. What would the gals like?

 Nope, he just did the vocab.
 Okay, I want to do text structure for 300.
