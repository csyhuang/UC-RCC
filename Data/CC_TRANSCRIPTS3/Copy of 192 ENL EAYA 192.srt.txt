Okay. What objects or pictures do you see?
I see a flag.
A flag.
 A sign.
The sun.
And the letters.
A sign. Yeah.
And the birds.
There are birds over here.
People carrying bags.
Okay, people carrying bags.
There's a ship.
A ship.
The ladies all have hats.
Okay. The ladies all have hats on. They look like they're dressed to go somewhere, right?
 Yeah.
Good. All right.
Do you want us to write it in here?
You can copy it. I have the words spelled up here. We have Uncle Sam. We have a boat.
Do you want us to write it?
I'm going to have it up here. Yeah.
Oh.
We have a flag.
We have this thing. What does this thing look like?
Kind of like a witch.
No. No.
Yeah. It looks kind of like a witch. Something scary anyway, right?
 Yeah.
Broccoli.
It looks like broccoli? Okay. Yeah, it does. It's kind of fluffy on top. I agree.
All right.
There are people.
We've got people. We've got birds.

Mm-hmm. So here are our objects. Uncle Sam, boat, American flag. I wrote scary devil-looking thing. If you want to put witch-looking thing, that's fine.
I'm gonna put both.
Traveling people and birds.

I put enough blanks for a few objects, but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote. All right. Okay. Which of the objects-- whoops. Okay. Which of the objects do you see could be symbols?
 The flag.
All right. This is what I want you to do. Stop. Turn to the person beside you. Beside you, beside you, beside you. See if you can think of-- you already said flag. That's a perfect example. It is one of them. I think four of these are symbols. Not every object is going to be a symbol. So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more. 

Each pair can be that.

Two different. Yeah.
Oh. 
All right. What did we come up with?
We came up with the top of his hat thing. It's the same as the flag.
It looks exactly like the flag, okay? So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of?
 U.S.
Of the United States. Good.
Did you come up with one?
The traveling people.
The traveling people? What do you think they symbolize?
They're from other countries.
Yeah. They symbolize people from other countries. Good. Did you come up with one?
The scary devil-looking thing.
Okay. What is that?
It's clouds in the sky?
Okay. It looks like clouds, but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary-looking thing?
To get them out?
To scare them?
Or maybe it's the rain. They're scared of storms.
Okay. Who is the devil-looking thing? Who is he going after?
 The people.
The people. What are the people running away from?
From their other countries.
From their other countries. So what could the cloud be a symbol of?
Bad things.
Immigrants?
Yeah. They're the immigrants. What is the cloud?

Yeah. Their governments from their own countries.
Oh.
Is coming back after them or trying to scare them, anyway. All right? Here we go. We have these four. Uncle Sam, the boat, the American flag, and the devil-looking thing. I didn't do one for the travelers, but you're right. They can symbolize immigrants. Uncle Sam symbolizes America. This is one you didn't say.
I told you.
The ark, this boat here symbolizes what?
 The Bible.
The ark from the bible. Okay. Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible?
 Yeah.
What did the ark do?
It saved.
It saved Noah, his family, and who else?
Animals.
And the animals.
Oh yeah. Now I remember.
So what do you think this boat's purpose in this picture is? What's the boat going to do?
Save them.
Save. Okay. So knowing that, knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America, what do you think? Are these people being stopped or welcomed?
 Welcomed.
Welcomed. And how do we know that?
He's letting them in. He's like, come on, let's go.
But how do we know that he's welcoming them and not telling them to stop?
Because it's the ark.
Because it says ark, okay? And we're connecting what we know about the ark to this picture. That is called an allusion. In English class, you talked about allusion. Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous. Some famous piece of literature. Okay? The flag stands for freedom. The scary devil-looking thing is governments from other countries. Take a second and copy that down. Okay. I'll go on to the next question. How are the words-- How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean? Okay? We talked about this already. The U. S. Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States. Okay? Identify the cartoon's caption. All right. In this cartoon, there is no caption. There is no title at the top or at the bottom, but there are some words that help us understand and that's this sign. The sign says no oppressive taxes, no expensive kings, no compulsory military service. So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants. To the traveling people. Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon. Okay? What words or phrases here can be used to identify?
I was going to say the ark.
Yeah. The Ark of Refuge. And what does it identify?

The ark.
It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon? What is the ark?
The boat.
But what is it a symbol of?
Welcoming.
Yeah. A symbol of welcoming people, right? Or a symbol of America itself, because once you're in, you're in America. What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant? All right? Calling the U.S. a refuge tells us people come here for safety.

We'll come back to it. And here, the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings. Tell us why people left their countries.
To get good jobs.
Yeah. To get jobs.
To have a better life.
Right. What were they running away from?
From paying taxes.
From paying taxes. From kings. Now, any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings?
1900s.
19th Century.
The 19th Century, which would be the periods were very big. Kings were a problem in some places in the world. No oppressing taxes. Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s, people were dealing with this, okay? So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out. All right? List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean? What adjectives are in the cartoon? It's on this sign for one thing.
Oh. The kings.
Okay. What did they call the kings?
Wealthy?
What did they call kings? What kind of kings did they have? It's kind of hard to read there. Okay. Here we go. We'll do it this way.
Controlling.
Yeah.
More powerful than others.
Expensive  can't see...
I know, I know. So oppressive means it's controlling. Expensive means they spend too much money.
 Yeah.
Compulsory means that you have to do something. Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army. So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army.

The army's a fantastic place, but not everybody wants to be there. You do understand, right?
Yes.
Okay. Anybody not want to be in the army?
I want to serve my country.
Yeah. Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it?
 No.
I want to have a choice.
You want to have a choice. I want my army to have chosen to be there. Right? Because I don't want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there, okay? Okay. Describe the action in the cartoon.
Action?
I can't cover those.
I forgot to put the space bar. Okay, so what's happening in the cartoon? We've already said this.
Everybody's coming to Uncle Sam.
And what's happening?
The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam.
Right. All right. What is the message of the cartoon?
It's that we have to welcome the immigrants.
Correct. The message of the cartoon is that the U.S. is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don't like. What special interest groups-- now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it. What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon? Stop and take a second. Turn to your partner. See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon. Talk to you partner.
What is it?
Okay. A special interest group. Go ahead, keep talking. A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them, okay? So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree?
