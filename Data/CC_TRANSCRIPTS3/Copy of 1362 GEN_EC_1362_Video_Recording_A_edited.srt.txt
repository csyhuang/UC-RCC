How do you know?  How do you think it might be different? Okay, maybe Ethan goes here . Measure yours and let's see.  And which one do you think you're going under?  I don't know.  Okay, all right.  Okay, well you all, listen to him, listen to him.  You all talk about it.  You talk to them, I'm gonna walk around.
It's my turn, EJ. 
 Okay, let him do the writing. 
Why are you taking them out of that one?  Okay, and what are you trying to make it do?
Balance.
Okay, balance. Let's see you trying to make it balance.  Okay. 
We need to put it right there.
Okay.  Did you balance it now? Okay, so what do put in that point? 
 I'm going to scoot this just a little it. And then you write it down, good. How did you know it was balanced? Good.  You said which one was heavier here? Okay, why did you say ?  Think you can do that one? How did you know it was balanced? Is it balanced? What about that?  At first, which one was balanced? Because why?  It was heavy, okay. 
Okay, so how many of those are ?
I think it was one more.  Okay, you're put it in. You'll put what in this one?  And the number of crayons you all used.  You had another object that was moving? Look right here. You think their eraser didn't move?
 What you all gonna test next?  Did you even measure that one? 
And I'll come back. Alright, what are you all doing here? 
Do you think if you did the scissors, and Matthew did the scissors, do you think it would measure the same?
 Let's do it.
Okay. Let's do it one at a time. What's happening? You guys can't measure, try this one. Here's my question. If Matthew blows the paper clip, is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip? What do you think? You don't think so? Why not?  Matthew, you blow.  Okay, all right, so remember that, okay? Now, Weslee, I want you to test it. You said you thought it would go different. See if you can make a difference. 
Yeah, why did it do something different? What's that that you're blowing out?
Air.
Air, and what is it?
Gas.
Gas, good. All right, you all can go ahead and finish measuring.  I saw Ella trying. Now, if you and Ella both try to blow on that do you think it's going to move? Why don't you think it's going to move?  You think it's too heavy? And you don't have enough breath.  Try it and see. See if you all both do it if you can get it to move.  You're going red in the face and it's going away. Did you all think it was going to move? You all didn't think it was.  How did you find this? What'd you do?
Counted. Okay, counted, and what are you working on right now?  The colors.  Okay, which one do you have to count now ? Which one do you have there?  This one, and what is that one? What is that one? A solid, a liquid, or the gas?
Solid.
A solid, how are you going to find out? What are you gonna do?
Look at this.
You're going to look at those, can you count those? I'm gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph, okay? You're doing good. Okay. Okay, can you come over here and count? You might have to get out of your chair, you have lots of them. 
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Eight. 
Five, six, seven, eight.
Check your numbers, and you checked to make sure. All right, whatcha going to do now?
Tally.
Tally them, okay, think you all can do that? Okay, you need help putting it on , remember which one is the total .  How did you know that so quick? I heard you started counting and then what did you do? You found it quickly.  You remembered from that, okay. How else could have known that fast?
Go down there. Go down there, okay, good.
