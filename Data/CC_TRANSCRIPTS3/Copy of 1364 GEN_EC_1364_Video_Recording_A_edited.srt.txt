So can you record two on that? 
It's harder to write two.
Remember, here, you can use your number line if you need it to help you. Do you want me to turn it? So there's the two. Can you try to write it?
 I did it. 
Awesome. That looks like a two. So was this awesome, all right, or super bad?
 Super bad.
Super bad. Why do you think it was super bad?
 Because it's not heavy.
Because it's not heavy.  Okay, Julia, what's our second problem?
Ow.
 The styrofoam ball.
The styrofoam ball. Can you find the styrofoam ball?  Yes, that one. We can, first we're gonna make--  This one is bigger. How does it feel, though? Is it round?  It does? We're gonna be answering questions over here. Julia, can you let  make his prediction?  Which one did you pick?
That one.
You picked all right. Why did you pick all right?  Because it's little. How does it feel? Feel it. No, it's not heavy.  What do you think? Is there anything that you're wondering about that?  What's next?  What do you think?
All right again?
You think all right, too?  Mark them all right.  You think awesome? You think it's gonna go 15 or more? Okay, let's see.  Are you ready? Can you pick up the tape and do it again? Gonna get the tape. 
You're supposed to do it again.
Because there's another space? Yep, we're gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time. Okay.   Put it this way. Ivan's gonna put it in, is everyone ready? Oh wait, you have to keep it upside down so it can push. Okay? Can you try it over? Ivan, are you ready? Let's try one more time. I'm gonna put this cup right in front. One more time.    Well, feel it.  Is it heavy?  That's okay. I'm gonna be right back.  Has anything surprised you so far?  What happened?  The orange ball? So what kind of push was it?
An awesome.
 An awesome push. So did that surprise you? You didn't think it was gonna go so far?
I though it was gonna go like .
Is that where the tape went? So you guys can pick up the tape. Should we do the green ball?
The green ball. Which ball so far...
 A zero.
A zero?  And it didn't move at all?
Yes.
Why do you think it didn't move?
Because it's so tiny.
It's so tiny. But does it weigh a lot?
No.
No, it didn't. Do you think that's why it didn't go far?
And it's so tiny. And it doesn't have more mass.
Ahh, I see. So, should we do this again?
Yeah.
The super bad is actually this one right here.
Oh, it's so tiny.
So feel it. How does it feel?  Let Luka feel it. How does it feel?  So Jacob, why don't you make your prediction? From all right to super bad. What do you think, Sofia? What did you put? Why did you put all right?  So right there. How far do you think it's gonna go?  What did you put, Sofia? Sofia picked... Luka, what do you think? Which one do you think? What's it gonna be? Awesome, all right, or super bad? Good pick, all right. So we're gonna do it down here on this one. All right. Are you ready? Make your prediction. And then we're gonna put it on the ground. What do you think? Awesome, all right, or super bad?  Who picked awesome? Sofia, right?  Do you guys have anything that you're--
Remember when we were... 
I do remember when we were trying to . What did we find out? What is it?  What do you think for the second ball?   You think a rock is inside? Maybe.
If they were rocks, then they would be so hard.
That's true, is it really hard?
A little.
A little bit hard? What do you think is inside? Can we find out? We can open one of these, probably. Let's put it down first. Everybody write it. Jacob, are you the recorder? What are you? The counselor? Are you the starter? Okay guys, is everyone ready?  You know what? We're gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup.  We can move the tape now.  Sofia, we need you to count. Move the cup over. How far did it go?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
Will you count again with me? Ready?
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Jacob, this went 10. Can you write 10 down?
No! 
For the super bad, it went 10. Yep.
It's super awesome.
So what do you think? Where did it go? Was it awesome, all right, or super bad?
Awesome.
All right.
It was all right. Why was it all right?  And is 10 more or less than 15? Less than 15. So that's why it's all right. Okay guys, I'm gonna go to the next group. Now what you're gonna do is trial two. You're gonna do every ball one more time. Okay? Yep.  We're gonna do it one more time. Okay, I will be right back.    How's it going over here? Has anything surprised you?  What surprised you?  Which ball didn't push it very far?  Wait, how far did it actually push? So that means that the cup didn't move at all?  Why do you think the cup didn't move?  Because it's so light? Which one moved the farthest so far? Which ball?  The orange one? Is the orange ball really light?  How does the orange one feel?  Like it has more mass? Is there anything you guys are wondering about?  If they're bouncy? Let's put this ball back. Does that one bounce?  I wonder why not.  Okay, so what are we putting next on your sheet? What should you do?  Are you putting the rubber ball?  Yeah. Are you guys all putting that you think it's gonna be an awesome push?  Ready?  Put tape here. Alexandra, are you the taper?   
It's on the wrong side.
No, she got it, she did it. So move the cup over. Now Nicholas is gonna count.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. 
Can you help write in 13?  Yeah, this one right here has a one and a three. Can you try writing that?
It's gonna have one more.
 It's gonna have one more? So if the styrofoam ball went zero, and the orange ball went 13, which one is more?
13.
How do you know that? You just know that?  When you count, does it come higher? Yes, it does? Okay, Ivan's ball is next. We need to do a trial shoot of which one?  Okay. 
You have a red...
Yeah, mine.
What do you guys think about this ball?
It's awesome.
It's awesome? Why is it awesome?
It's awesome because it's red and it's the Cardinals' color.   
Well, I would love for you to come. Should we see how far it goes? All right, let's check it.   It knocked the cup over. Let's try one more time.   It knocked it over again. We're gonna put the tape here.  Do you think that was farther than the rubber ball?  But when the ball goes farther.  Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.  What?
Can you find it on the number line? Where's 11? Uh huh, that's what it looks like. Is 11 more or less than 13?  Is it more than 13 or less? Which one?  Is what?
More than.
Is more than 11? If you look on the number line. So you're right, 13 is more.
Yeah.
Yeah. Okay, you guys can start putting the balls away.
