We gotta work quiet. 
It's three and a half inches long, and is it? Seven centimeters.
Keep going, gotta keep going.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
It's probably about one pound. 
Okay, yeah let's go.
I don't know how...
You measure it with this, inches then centimeters.
One inch.
That's one inch.
One inch.
Yeah, then do it across.
We need one inch, one and a half.
One and a half.
Three and a half.
You got it.
It's a bone, got a bone.
Pick it up.
It'd be easier if we could pick it up.
Here's a bone.
There's one yeah.
You all, let's put it in the middle.
We gotta tear it apart now.
We don't have to tear it apart even more.
It's a bone. It's part of that.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
 and feathers.
You all start pulling those ones.
It's on my finger!
There's a ball.
It's a bird, it's a bird.
No, look at this claw.
It's a bird, it's a bird.
It's a birdy bird.
Look, there's its, wait where's its?
There's its teeth and there's its--
It's a skull.
You all be careful with those little ones.
Just broke it.
Oh my god, I found something. 
You guys are being mean. 
A skull.
I found a skull right there. 
How many skulls did you all predict would be in your owl pellet?
I put one.
One? How many have you found so far? Was it right?
We found a couple bones.
What about skulls, how many skulls?
It's tiny. Alright, how can you determine what kind of animal it is? How much did it weigh?
Ten grams.
Ten grams. Do you think, do you think its weight has anything to do with how many skulls inside? Why would that have anything to do with...
Because the skull might weigh about two grams maybe.
I think here's another skull. It's got a lot of bones in it.
Okay, see if you can determine what animal it is.
Looks kind of like a teacup.
This is a rat skull because I can see its teeth right here.
I know, Jake found another skull I think.
This is a skull.
This is so cool.
Let's get playing boys and girls.
You all, I think this is what we got.
No, that is a bone.
No look, look. Where's the claw? And look at this claw. I think it's the same.
And then look.
Look, let's see.
Oh, that's a skeleton.
Oh, that is a skeleton.
Ooh, my touching it.
A whale,.
Ooh yay, we found a skeleton. Look at the skeleton Chloe.
It's a skull. It's a skull.
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
Put the feathers and stuff over here.
Or whatever it is.
Yeah, we need to  the feathers.
Look, this is soft.
It's not soft, it has something.
There's a little baby bone.
It looks like a squirrel.
Look, I got a baby bone.
No, seriously.
What animal did you predict you would find in your owl pellet?
A bird. A bird, a gopher and a rat.
So what have you, have you decided what it is?
A bird.
How did you determine it was a bird?
We found like big claws like this.
How can you be sure that it's a bird claw?
Because these are usually as hard and like sharper. 
We put this.
Oh, we got the skull and we got a skull.
How many animals, how many skulls have you found?
We only found like two. This is what I was thinking. You know how it has sharp stuff up there?
What's a way that you can determine what it is?
I think we got a bird, we got some more claws.
However much bones you find...
Compare the bones that you found to the bones on the chart?
I found another skeleton.
Keep working.
It has to be a bone, this might be something right there.
Let me get that out, because I haven't got anything out yet.
We got two skulls.
I found something, I found this.
Another skull.
Yeah, I think.
Found another bone.
You did?
Yep.
We found all sorts of, here's another, this  is a claw.
It's a bird.
Is this a bird claw or, I don't know.
I think that's a...
Where's the bird skull?
Found something.
What is it?
Wait, hold on, wait.
I think we'll find another skull.
What do you think this is Daniel? What do you think this is?
I don't know.
Know what that is?
I bet that's probably something.
I think this bone might be something found in its arm.
You all, look what I found.
I think this is a skull right here because...
We got them two, don't worry.
We got a bone, we got a bone.
We got the same skeleton.
Have you determined what your animal is?
No, we don't know.
I think this is an eyeball.
We got a bunch of eyeballs.
Here, let me see that.
Look, look, look.
It's a tooth.
Eyeball.
Let me see.
Look, I found this. 
This is the  part of the eyeball.
Look, look, I found the--
Ew!
I found the pelvis! I found the pelvis. 
The owls are on this chart. 
I think that might be something, wait. 
With the tweezers.
Here's an eye socket.
Over there somewhere.
This is this I think.
We need to get the hair out of it.
Oh my word. I think we got...
Look, I got the head.
See how sharp these are?
