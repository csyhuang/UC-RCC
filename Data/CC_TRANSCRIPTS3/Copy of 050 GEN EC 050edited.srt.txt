They thought they would settle the land.
Okay, Karev, why did the government give them free land? 
Okay, they were . What did they have to do on that land?
 Build a house.
Okay, build a house, that's right. That's right, so what kind of house did they build?
  A sod house.
They made a sod house. Why did they not make a wood house?
 Because there weren't a lot of trees on the prairie.
Okay, but you said the trunks were made out of wood, how did they get trunks made out of wood?
 Because they made it before they left.
They made it before they left, that's correct.
Can the doll have long hair?
You're doing a great job. You're just gonna have to imagine that. That's right, they made their trunks before they left. Did they just need one trunk?
 No.
Okay.
 Twice.

Wood.
 A lot of wood. Good job! You can go sit down. Thank you! You did a great job! Very good job.  Did they take everything with them on the trip? Why did they not take everything with them?  Okay, so when they got there, did they have furniture to put into their sod homes?
No, because 
They just moved in, they had just moved in. Where there good things about a sod home? Eli, what was good about a sod home?  That's right, and what made them that way?
Because the ground is cooler.
Okay, the ground is cooler. Were the log homes good as well?
 Yeah.
Okay, but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house?
 It's not warm in winter.
And do you remember when we did a Venn Diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two?
Yeah, 
So that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through. What was the best structure to live in?
 A log cabin.
A log cabin.
So that, animals couldn't get on top of it and 
If you lived in a dug out, Cayden, would you, if it came a big rain storm, would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out?
 Back.
Why?  It's a dryer place, isn't it. Okay, you guys continue to work, okay?  Tell me what you know about a log house. Willie, tell me something you know about a log house.  Okay, they didn't have any air conditioners, . Kennedy, you guys are making a log house. What are you putting in your log house?
Dolls and some family and some furniture.
Okay. Did they have a lot of furniture for their log house Brody? Did they have furniture for their log house?
 Yeah, but when they got there, they had to have time to gather up some furniture.
That's right, when they first moved there, they didn't have any furniture. But eventually they built some, didn't they? I see you're putting a fireplace in there. What did they burn in their fireplace?
They were burning, um buffalo chips.
They are? In a log house they're burning buffalo chips?  That's right, in a sod house, they're gonna burn buffalo chips. Why not wood in a sod house?
Because, in a prairie, they would run out of, if they had enough wood, they would build a wood house, build a log house.
That's exactly right.  Were there buffalo chips where there were log houses?
No.
Why were there not buffalo chips?  So buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were. Where did the buffalo live? What was it called?
The prairie.
 The prairie. And what is a prairie?  Open grasslands, that's exactly right. And what are you making, Dillon?

 A lantern. A lantern, why do you have a lantern in your log house?  Okay, and so, you can see?
