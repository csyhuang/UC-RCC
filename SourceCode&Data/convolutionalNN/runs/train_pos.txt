 Hi welcome to the library media center At the entrance we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings At our situation desk we have a suggestion box our series list and magazines and books to entice students as they check out In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners as well as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout For the teachers I have a professional library with over 3 000 books DVDs manipulatives and kits developed to support the curriculum Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library The paperbacks a student favorite arranged by genre just like in retail stores All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series I give special consideration to my reluctant reader s needs if students interests were looking for fiction or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels We have 13 desktop computers and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet numerous databases Impact and a variety of software On the school library website they find reviews blogs links to resarch sites as well as book suggestions trainers and podcasts many of which are created by the students On the left hand side of the library the reference and the non fiction sections are located Our many biographies are housed on the non fiction side of the center counter I have many displays throughout the library and around the school but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews or projects and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service But we don t we don t find our food and just like The three little pig wolf thing She counted all the way up And she wants to know the lines or something We re going to now that you guys have most of your categories filled in I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that s in front of you There are two reviews for this book Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews If you find something in common circle it on your graphic organizer I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews And again you can work with your partner on this one it talks about what they deserve and 30 more seconds That s okay Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked for and found in the story and what you find in the review Yes The review has some additional items in it doesn t it There are a lot of people with the same basic items Anyway I wanted to do a quick Venn diagram up here and compare and contrast I want for each group this group I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn t in the review Or one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper Okay Okay you guys I want you to find one for each of those groups I want you to find one thing that was in common So this is compare this is contrast Contrast compare Find one thing that was in common and one thing that s different Oh okay here s a sticky in the middle of the table I want you to write it on the sticky You guys hard Awesome step up here and tell us what it is and where does it go Awesome perfect So all you guys came up with a We did like don t count your chickens before they hatch and it was in our graphic organizer Oh okay Perfect and that was Good perfect Okay so everybody here found something that they had that wasn t in the review it was in their graphic organizer You guys come on up This table everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review We found Super Super so that goes in the middle because it s in common with both of them This group Perfect they found both in the review and in their organizer that So that was a What category Oh was that in common Did you find it in the review also or was it Just you guys found it So where would it go Excellent excellent That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn t in the review so it would go over here perfect Okay next We found that the Okay so you found something that was only in the review that the how the pigs disguised themselves Where do we put that on that Excellent something that was only found in the review Save the best for last What d you guys find We found that the graphic organizer and the review they both talked about that related to like the The allusions in there Wizard of Oz Three Little Pigs Excellent that was So we see an awful lot is in common with these Sometimes you guys find something that aren t in the reviews the reviews sometimes had something you didn t find They are a little bit different Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is You won t necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there and that s okay What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book and give a substantiated opinion of the book Why do What are the good features of this book What are the weaknesses in the book that you read Now there are other things that you may need in there and I ll show where you can get some additional information Let s bring this on down here In the online catalog Both of those computers are logged in over there Okay look up So far So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself Oh yeah that was a really long book or Oh that was a quick read That would be something to kind of jog your memory there Things like Oh yeah this was about Korea 
 Write at the top of your paper The color that you want for your sugar and the color you want for your salt on both of them Sugar on one salt on the other Yes because you can make from your sheet two Now the purpose of these sheets is so you can actually take your spoon Malik take your spoon and dip out onto that paper This gives you a better visual of how much sugar and how much salt is in that particular food Now what s the most important thing about the label Serving Size Serving size Good Aaron serving size So that is showing most of these is the container itself That s the reason we went to snack foods so that you could see how much that is This also gives you a better idea of how much you eat Some of you like Aaron may eat two or three of these especially if it was Gummies right Aaron Yes It s not Gummies but it s close Okay so any questions before you get started Okay decide who is going to do calculations decide who s going to measure first I want you to rotate those responsibilities around and Devon what is your question Remember the personal column is how much you would eat the serving size Doesn t matter your group remember has to cooperate figure out who s going to do what and just look at responsibilities Just make sure everyone sees how much sugar how much salt it is That s the important part On the back of your paper When it says about 29 grams right here What s the serving size Serving size is here there are four servings in here They would eat half the bag then it would be two servings So next is the total calories and it s got 130 calories total carbs ok so nine grams Now when you dip out your salt and sugar try to replace it in the correct bucket we don t want the salt in the sugar or the sugar in the salt So pay attention to what you re doing Now remember you have to calculate what you would eat Give me some sugar 11 grams divided by four Put two teaspoons on here Is it sodium Dip it out you see how much See visually how much it is I don t have any salt Yes Paul I want to encourage you that after you done something that s really sugary do something that you would think would be salty as if it surprises you how much sugars in it 
 Does everyone agree on the first question Yeah What did you all agree on That it wasn t really fair for For First and Second Class to go through without any problems and the people from the Steerage had to go through examinations and this whole long hassle And why was that Why did people who were First and Second Class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations Cause of the money What about the money Because they thought that they had they were perfect They had no disease They had lots of money and thought they would work hard So the stereotype is what That rich people are more can work harder or have less chance of disease than the people in Steerage Do you think that that stereotype is still true today Or do you think it s not true anymore It was just for First and Second Class passengers for Steerage passengers before emigrating Well it s kind of like this It s not over the top but it s just a little bit What do you guys think about what Eric said I agree with him Why It s not fair because First and Second Class usually are kings or royalty and so if you re in Steerage you re just a normal person If you re in Steerage it s not going to be fair You have to go walk through that and Well First and Second Class Passengers they weren t necessarily royalty they were just people who had a lot of money People who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive What do you guys think about what Eric said That the stereotype today is still here but not really Just kind of back and forth It s back and forth They don t do the same thing anymore Who s they And what s the same thing The American Embassy The people that take care of the immigrants and everything and all about them They don t go to Ellis Island anymore They don t go to Ellis Island anymore You have to go on a plane or you have to drive here But do you think the stereotype in general that rich people are better or they don t have diseases and they re just better than people who don t have a lot of money Do you think we still have those stereotypes today Sometimes Sometimes Have you seen it ever No No but you just think it s still there I haven t really seen it at all Yeah I agree with Okay You can start the next one Hold on Josh did you have something else to add Yeah On TV shows sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes And they re usually pretty snotty And how do you know they re snotty They re always like Don t touch that It s going to fall and you re going to pay for that Oh okay So you do see in TV sometimes Yeah All right Do you think immigrants were treated fairly at Ellis Island Why or why not I don t think they were treated very fairly because they had to go through I agree with Jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at Ellis Island but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in America Yeah and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay Some of the doctors two people could have the same diseases but both the doctors one doctor could send one person home and one person could stay at Ellis Island which is unfair Possibly because of their religion or the way their language I think they were mostly I think they were mostly yeah So they were mostly treated well but sometimes not Sometimes not Yeah The doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back And remember the book that we read It kind of said that the cousin he had to be sent back to well he almost had to be sent back to his country because To Russia Yeah to Russia because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected His father was trying to tell him but they didn t listen Yeah He didn t I think they should have translators with all of them so then it would make it fair That spoke English and that language That language So they can understand things So I would say mostly Yeah Mostly So should we check them both off I think we should check off the first one If they were sick or something or if they needed food they had places where they could get food Or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital like Sophia said So I m in the middle Kind of Because sometimes they were treated badly I agree with Josh because if they were sick they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases Like Oh Get away from me because you re going to spread that disease to everybody It s going to be an epidemic I want to add if they were sick they could have been contagious and there were a lot of people at Ellis Island so they might have Usually if they were at a hospital they were curing curable diseases because if they couldn t cure it they didn t have a medicine or anything to cure that they got sent back Yeah I agree with Eric and Sophia Go ahead Were you going to say something I was going to say if we all agree on this So your general feeling here is were they treated fairly at Ellis Island They weren t treated not very fairly Like they were treated half the fair that they should have been but they weren t treated really good They were fed very well and all their needs were there but they weren t treated very good like if you were on an airplane in First Class It s kind of like I would like to add they were treated way better in Ellis Island because on the ship in Steerage they didn t have good food They couldn t really bathe and it was all crowded They didn t really have a good place to sleep but in Ellis Island they actually had okay food They weren t treated like Do you think that it was fair that they each had to have 20 on them in order to stay Yeah Sort of Sort of What I think is they need to take care of themselves and America is actually bringing lots of them over here America just could say Stop No more immigrants at all but they ve been letting people in A lot of people in and they ve been very generous by giving them food and letting them live here in this wonderful country So they ve provided enough I have something I have two things to say I agree with Sophia because I sort of agree with Sophia because if they didn t have 20 they wouldn t have much to live and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants They re responsible for themselves They re on their own and I would like to say is that going back to Sophia s It said that then they were fed well and that they were All wanted to get to America and even if some of them had money how do you know that they didn t have a disease or something How do you know if they didn t have lice or something I kind of agree with you because if they paid more I think they shouldn t get a lot a lot more but I think they should get a little bit more but they still should go to Ellis Island Yeah Sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships and kind of gave the medical exams to First and Second Class Passengers to make sure they didn t have any diseases And then if their medical exams checked out fine then they could skip everything else So they didn t have to get asked all those questions and they didn t have to wait in all those long lines and things like that So what do you think about that I think it s still unfair that they didn t have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat I think instead of Ellis Island they should have checked them before they got on the boat for everyone Yeah I agree with you I think they got all seasick Think that s where they all got sick Yeah Like in the Steerage Some of them got sick because they were in Steerage and then when they got to Ellis Island they had to get sent back The reason why some of them got sick was because they didn t have fresh air and so they couldn t breathe that well Stuffy in Steerage I think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don t like them for their religion and stuff Could doctors send people back because they didn t like their religion Doctors could send people back why Doctors couldn t send people back but they would mark letters on your back Why could they mark letters on your back Because they probably thought they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch So just if you were hurt and then they had to go through further medical exams to see but doctors couldn t just say I don t like you You have to go back They were just examining you to make sure you didn t have a contagious disease that could get other people sick When we were reading they said something about the doctors where they didn t have any diseases or anything but they d still send them back And you read that in the book We were reading one of the things Oh and why would they send them back Why would they get sent back by the legal inspectors and other people Sometimes it was like there were random reasons they sent them Just because Yeah That s not fair That s what you re saying Yeah I d also change the part where they had to why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes Yeah I mean they should have given a sheet or something Or something Because what if that s the only thing they had You know I think they should mark on their skin or something so then you could just wash it off Like a marker or something No I don t think they should do it on the skin because then if there was a water fountain they could just wash it off and say I m in this line Right True They could They could do that We all agree they should do something other than your own clothes They should give you a sheet of paper and You could rip it apart I think that they way they did it for example that guy in the book did his jacket inside out They should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them Because someone could just say Take this jacket inside out and then go into the other line Or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow Yeah Oh I don t have a jacket Yeah Yeah If we didn t have Ellis Island not as many immigrants would be here probably because it d be a lot harder And Ellis Island they fed you food It was good I like it I agree with Josh because they gave you food and water a place to sleep They built stuff and made kinder cares and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown ups The people that were there at Ellis Island didn t even have to pay for any of that That was all for free I mean imagine that happening to us right now That will never happen I definitely agree with Sophia because if you just come to Ellis Island and they just give you potato soup every meal it s kind of like they don t get a good impression of America I think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on America from giving them good food and a good way to start their time in America and then they realize how complicated it is Yeah According to everyone I kind of agree It was good I think 
 At the end of class I want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further Because the faster the bat goes the further the ball s gonna go And there s three things that we re going to do to make the bat swing faster Okay we re going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer We re gonna hold the end to make it longer A longer bat means a faster bat We re gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we re gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing And we re learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy Because there s lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles And we re gonna do four different things today I m gonna ask you to talk to a partner I m gonna do a little experiment we re gonna play spotlight tag and then we re gonna have some personal practice And I ve created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like Now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster I want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement Go ahead Hey everybody let me get your attention If I pull your stick I want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something We re green No we re red Jeremiah where s Jeremiah Yes Softball Softball very good Raquel where s Raquel What Raquel Game or something you can play Do we use a bat to play soccer No No How about Stephanie Baseball Who said golf what about golf What about ping pong Do you know what ping pong is Yeah So all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat Now we re gonna go around the blue house and you re gonna sit on the red dot until I say go and I m gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further I would like you to walk please be careful Go Okay thank you for sitting Now over there I said the longer the bat the faster it goes The faster the bat the further the ball goes So I m gonna show you what I mean Is this a very long bat No No so I m gonna swing and see how far it goes Did it go very far No Now I m gonna make that longer Who thinks it s gonna go further Let s see if it goes further It went a little bit further huh Yes Now by holding the bat at the end it ll make it longer and it ll go further Now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles So I m only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat You think this will this go very far Yeah Yeah Okay let s see No I didn t use a lot of muscle Now I m gonna use lots of muscles on this step and I m gonna twist see how far it goes Do it again do a lot of muscle Anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster Hit from the bottom I had it written over there Does anyone else remember I want to make my bat longer I want to use lots of muscles and Alex That s how we use lots of muscles I want to swing the bat for as long as I can in order to generate speed Now if I start my bat right here and I swing it do I have lots of time to hit the ball No Do you think it ll go far Let s see what happens Now if I start way back here do you think I ll have more time Yeah You think it ll go further Yeah All right let s see So raise your hand if you want to hit the ball far Hitting the ball far will help you be successful and if you re successful you re going to have a good time But today we re going to learn different ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast Don t swing please tell me It makes the bat go faster Why does the bat go faster The bat goes faster the ball goes faster But what makes the bat go faster because it s short or long Long Longer bat means faster Okay rotate Rotate Dominant hand on top Step twist We re practicing what grip is the best How d that one go Fernanda what grip are you using Mr Holden can I go to the bathroom Hurry Excellent twisting Derek excellent twisting What number are you going to read it Try this one hold your bat with your hands apart Put your left hand on top I mean your right hand on the top Left hand at the bottom Spread your hands apart like this Now try it again How did that go Is that one good You think so Now hold it at the end see what happens It s right here Now hold your hands put your right hand on the top Right hand on the top your right hand on top All right Fernanda Big step let s see it Big step twist your whole body Get your bat back there you go Try it again Did the ball go further that time Okay sit behind your little cone and answer the question on your card Alright now read it out loud for me Which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest Holding it at the end Remember when we talked about how long the bat is A longer bat can travel faster or slower Faster so when you hold it at the end it makes it longer and then you can swing it faster and then the ball goes further Is that what happened Yeah All right rotate Alright are you going to twist or not twist Back foot step Put your weight on your front foot Alright so pretend your feet are stuck in mud so you can t move them So we ve been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far because when we hit the ball far our game and when we re batting is more enjoyable We ve practiced we ve talked about and we ve discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further When we re batting okay I have a sentence frame for you it says I can blank to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further Okay you re in your batting team groups right now When I say go I want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further And then I m gonna pull our sticks and you ll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster So now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers Are there any questions No Okay I m gonna give you about two minutes Use the sentence frame discuss with your group Go ahead Alright how is your group doing Jesse you getting to share I might pick your stick Talk with Alex What are we coming up with Jeremiah How are we gonna make the bat go faster Do you remember Okay how about Alex Why do we twist Alex Alex why do we twist Alex sit up please When we twist we use more what Muscles What color were we Black or green Red Oh we were red Okay second grade eyes on me please Sit down on a number You ve had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster If I pick your name please stand up speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster Let s see here Jonathan All right Jonathan stand up buddy Jonathan use the sentence frame I can I can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further Good answer give him a round of applause When we have a longer bat it generates more speed and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further Now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster

Alright now one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high frequency words and learning all of our high frequency words Our high frequency words are on our word wall So that s one place that you can look if you get stuck Another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part So we re going to go through and that s what we re going to do right now We are going to look at the pictures Are you ready Hedgehog is hungry That s our title Now what time of year do you think it is Winter Winter It is definitely winter Because all of the leaves are off the

mouth ready for the beginning sound Alright let s run our finger underneath it now Let s look at it Let me write it Let s do Bug Let s spell bug and see How would we spell bug Get your arms ready Is that going to be the word bug No No So we re going to have to look at that This is the word beetle Can you say that word Beetle And look underneath it What do you see underneath it That is a slug Ooooh Now just like eyes are up here Lilly Eyes are up here Okay there we go Just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound you all also know how to decode words Is everybody s eyes up here So we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend which is sl What sound is the U going to make Uh Because there s only one vowel And what sound s the G going to make Guh Let s blend it together Are you ready Sl u g Slug Now look at me You have three ways now You can look at the pictures You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound And you can decode words that have one vowel

hedgehog Let s all get together Here we go Hedgehog is hungry Here is a snail Hedgehog is hungry Here is a worm Here is a caterpillar Here is a beetle Here is a slug Hedgehog is hungry in the spring Very good job I am very proud of you all 
 Exactly Right So what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically I know you re the big newspaper man and everything What do you think about that That s what I m talking about I m talking about the growth of the poem overall The first passage it s almost not objective but it kind of states what s happening It doesn t actually say what the author is thinking As the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it s more of the author s point of view and the author s stance on what s happening Nora what do you think about the poem so far I thought it was a good like utilization of the message I m taking African American history this year Okay We ve been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks So that first part we were talking about how they were like the sickness What are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything We have jettisoned the blind to no avail It spread The terrifying sickness spreads It s claws have scratched the sight from the captain s eyes The slaves were all tied together in their own so the sickness and disease could spread through them But also the slavers like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease That s where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they re in such close quarters that it s inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them superior as civilized but they re still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle So you really think that there s a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks who they think are savages I don t think it s even a point of transformation I believe that the author Robert Hayden is talking about this as it has been So this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they re sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it s like there s all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are er these whites are becoming like the blacks What s your favorite line that shows this Nick Standing to America bringing home black gold black ivory black seed Now I especially liked the middle part of that black ivory Because ivory is usually white Of course Yes Yeah So you have the juxtaposition of black and white Yes I think the lines after that Deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones New England pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes Jordan what do you think the about this religious connotation Well seeing that I m not too familiar with the Bible Judaism and Christianity are similar but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading I saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals these slaves and making the best of them in the new world Between that and the evil that they re really bestowing upon the slaves Standing to America bringing home black gold black ivory black seed is kind of glory and that contrast between evil Deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones New England pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes They also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they re going through a time of spiritual crisis What port awaits us Davy Jones or home I ve heard of slavers drifting drifting play things of wind and storm and chance their crews gone blind the jungle hatred crawling up on deck It s like they understand that they re becoming uncivilized and they re trying to find a way to change this To justify their actions Yeah That s what they need a justification for their actions So they say God is with them and everything is okay And you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn that Jesus our Savior pilot throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the God into all of this so that it s almost as if to me they re looking for their justification They re looking to justify the horrific actions that they re putting out Which is ironic because these are often these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil So it s ironic that they re claiming that God is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks I think it s also ironic though that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world At the end talking about John Quincy Adams he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers The suffering that they had been enduring And that s like the moment of irony Yeah The slavers are saying How paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august John Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters And with his Roman rhetoric weave a hero s garland for Cinquez This is what I want you all to think about Think about the historical connections here John Quincy Adams one of our founding fathers fourth president of the United States was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for Cinquez and the other slaves that were on the Amistad which is a ship that of course being discussed in here Think about these historical connections I shall return All right group What s going on We re talking about a poem You re talking about a poem I m going to talk about a poem too What a coincidence I know Isn t it coincidental What s going on What are you all discussing so far We re looking for the marrow part You re looking for the marrow part Yeah I m glad you all have your Beloveds out and everything What really interests me is the fact I think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated This is their story is it not What do you all think How can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of Beloved In the second part in the last paragraph it says The fever is melting down my bones Yes Right now we re connecting that to Stamp Paid who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow as in his bone marrow We re looking for the page right now Okay Found it Okay And it s on this Whoa What is that Read the passage to us My marrow is tired he thought I ve been tired all my days bone tired but now it s in the marrow It must be what Baby Suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life Okay So let s connect what you say in this stanza you have I d be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones What is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion We thought that her fever is melting down we thought that it was it s pretty much the exact same connection because it s bones going into the marrow so the outside going into the inside The fever is melting down to my bones it s just taking a different way And to get more than a physiological point of view here the marrow is where Where is the marrow In your bones It s like the core So Raphael when we re suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way what does it mean for us It basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted Okay So in essence then from a symbolic point of view just like in Beloved we can relate this to the poem What kind of corruption do you see here For me it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy Okay Hypocrisy in what context Mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right that they were different like this passage this short passage here It sickens me to think of what I saw of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men true Christians all like so much jetsam Yes And then at the very beginning they re talking about how they re throwing slaves overboard Or even when the slaves decide to Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks sang as they went under Yeah So there s this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning Laura what do you think is going on in this particular context With all of the jumping off board it s a true escape to eternal freedom I guess if you believe in Heaven The thing that confuses me is I understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over obviously death and more of a pain but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness the blindness and having to wait I think it s like another three weeks before they come to port So it s really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth This poem focuses I think on both sides on black and white Yes It really does illustrate both Which do you think is best illustrated Laura the black side or the white side The black side is really I don t want to say common but it s similar to everything you hear about slave ships And the slave trade and the slave trade So I think it s interesting that Hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don t really focus on what came of slavery Even though it was a horrible thing on the last page here it says That you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves I thought it was interesting because I often fail to make the connection that through the slavery we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the Civil War Jordan continue I was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about Here it says Their moaning is a prayer for death Yes Some try to starve themselves And then you go down one two three four stanzas later it says Jesus Savior pilot me over life s tempestuous sea We pray that thou will grant O Lord safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls It s not so much praying for death it s praying and knowing that Jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of Who is praying for Jesus here Jordan The slaves Really That s how I took it Okay Did anybody here take it a different way I took it as the sailors Exactly Good Not that that s I think you re on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves So I think that they could be So I think there s a real sort of duality there For this point in history they evangelized Evangelized They had already Evangelized Yes It s a hard word to say Africa I know the Dutch for example had already been there So historically speaking then Raphael when you say it s the slavers that are the ones that are praying what s ironic about all of this That they re so much in the wrong and they don t see it all and that kind of hypocrisy And they re looking for justification for their actions Speaking of justification what I want you to think about now for a few minutes I m going to talk to the other group up front here why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style It s all quotes It s all basically kind of like it s from a ship s log So think about this and I m going to be back to talk to you about it All right group what s going on It s all going on It s all going on Okay Tell me What have we discussed Everything Everything Tell me more Well we ve discussed about how in this stanza That there was hardly room tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon fashion there that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood That was talking about the capture of the Africans Yes Who wouldn t be so thirsty that they wouldn t tear open their own skin and drink their own blood Which is just crazy in terms of the suffering Yeah And how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery And yet in the next stanza it talks about how the crew would lay with the The Guinea Rose Yeah The crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins Okay Well let s talk about it for just a second We have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering What do you think Yeah It s a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew like would sleep with these women Exactly They re fully taking advantage of them Imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey Yeah It s a very big contrast because they are calling them animals So what happens after their lust In the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew They abandon the ship It goes up in flames Exactly So it s basically set on fire and then what happens 
 It s big Okay And that s all and the little blood cells and I drew one on there in kinda like a magnified and there s little blood strands they re blood strands DNA strands Now those DNA strands are only in the blood Are they anywhere else in your body They re in your hair and in your fingernails in your skin they re everywhere Okay so it s not just in the blood But you usually get it from the blood Blood Okay alright It looks like you ve got a couple questions You can call on whoever you want Me Are these questions You guys are these questions for Ryan Okay How do you know Chuck was right What Well he s a pretty smart guy Who Chuck my uncle Oh okay Maybe Even though there s a bunch of DNA on the strand what does that have to how do you know that a piece of that DNA came from either the mom or the dad That s why because DNA comes from both of them The dad gives the DNA and the mom provides the DNA Okay David It was in the blood right You said it was in the blood right Yeah Yes but couldn t blood be transmitted to another person because they had the yeah it could be transmitted to another person so that s not really a trait Sure when someone gets a blood transfusion Yeah Right Like if you re in the hospital and you re injured and you get blood transfusions If your eyes are blue and you get a blood transfusion from a brown eyed person does that turn your eyes brown No It could if Okay Does it give you a widow s peak when you have a straight hairline No Okay If I get a blood transfusion tomorrow hopefully that doesn t happen but if I get a blood transfusion tomorrow is that going to give me a cleft chin No If the person had a cleft chin But how do people die when they get when they get blood transfusions Carlos can we talk about that later maybe Let s stick with how we get our traits Do we get it through the blood Okay not really Girls what do you think over there I was sure it had something to do with the blood but that s between your parents and it has nothing to do with the traits so I don t know Do you want to come over here too I want to come over there with the boys Yes I You guys are you guys haven t even said anything yet and already they re they re joining your group Okay should we hear from the people who think I ve got a large Lorenzo do you want should we hear from you Or are you thinking about coming over to this group too You re set okay Let s hear from Lorenzo Okay Lorenzo what do you think I think that it was that brown eyed people have more traits than blue eyed people because I know more people that are brown eyed than blue eyed and I think I read somewhere that usually brown eye is a dominant trait over the blue eyes So for most of the times brown eyed people if you have brown eyed parents you will get brown eyes but how is So you heard something about a dominant trait Okay any questions about that dominant trait Brown eyes being dominant trait Because a lot of people have brown eyes like that and not many people have blue eyes True Blue eyes are more rare Okay Lorenzo whoever you want to call on you ve got two people So like what you were saying right now something about your parents then you would get it from your parents Hmm What Because when he was when he was saying that about the traits he said you if your parents have brown eyes or blue eyes that you re gonna get that trait from them So from your parents so Interesting Do you get what she s saying What She s she s saying she s sticking with this group because it s coming from your parents Okay That s why they say it s half and half Okay Also I m in your group too but what s it called Yeah I see more brown eyes but still they always get their traits from the parents not only But a lot of people have some people still get blue eyes and then others it s because of they still get the traits from the parents and some of them don t look alike so What about what about some people have both of the parents have brown eyes and some of the kids turn they have their blue eyes though Yeah that s great because that s a great how many of you guys have seen something like that I have seen it Where two parents have one trait and then their kid has the opposite trait Like brown eyed parents blue eyed kid You guys have seen that Why does that happen What do you think I m not really sure I know my parents have brown eyes and me And you have green eyes Yeah Your parents both have brown eyes right And your eyes are blue Yeah Okay so why does that happen Lorenzo since it was your idea let s hear from you If I m correct there s more brown eyed traits so you get if you have a brown eyed parent and a blue eyed parent you get a brown eyed trait and a blue eyed trait but because brown eyed is dominant most of the time you get brown eyed But you still have blue eyed traits so even if you have two parents with brown eyed trait if they both also have the blue eyed trait you could get blue eyes I have a question for you Lorenzo You keep using this word dominant trait Does in your mind does dominant mean more More When you re saying more traits in your mind does dominant mean there s more of it Yeah Okay what do you guys how many of you guys have heard this word dominant There s recessive too which is Recessive Okay does dominant mean more Anyone know that It means power over the others Like an overpowering trait he s trying to say Are you trying to say more Are you trying to say more or are you trying to say stronger Stronger Okay so this group the group you re sitting in the group one right now is someone who thinks that there s more traits come from the brown Do you think that You re not sure Say yes But you know something about dominant Okay I ll stay with my group Yes Can I make my own group where it s like Yeah Good yes What are you thinking I m moving Maybe it s just maybe that nature decides what something will look like because I don t know my parents have brown eyes and I have blue eyes and we don t really have anyone else who has blue eyes You re picking the Wait a minute Fiona no Olivia Yeah nature Okay nature makes so you ve got blue eyes nature had something to do with that not your parents Yeah Okay Anyone want to respond to that Ryan How does nature do that How does nature choose your eye color Doesn t it have something to do with your parents Of course how could you just a slot machine where it s like ching and then the eye colors roll around and stuff Oh you got blue eyes I don t know Let him respond You re not sure No I m not sure I m still Any other questions Oh yeah And like you know how I was gonna ask this what if you get it from your grandparents or your Grandparents have black eyes Or from your aunts or something I really don t know If your aunts and sisters Yeah what if his aunt and sister has blue eyes That s right What if somewhere way back someone in your family had blue eyes You guys better I don t see how that How does that happen Does anyone know people who look like their grandparents Yeah my cousin does Lorenzo My mom said that I look like my grandparent because I have a mole or something that s in the same spot as my grandpa If that s the case for you does that support what he s saying Nature decides Or does that keep you in what you re thinking It keeps me in But I have a question Okay How do people one eye is blue and the other one is green Oh I know that one That s a mutation No no some people have really Yeah like All right let s refocus Let s refocus We haven t heard from this group We haven t heard from the few groups that have the most amount of people in them Okay so let s give them a chance to talk Ladies can you start us off You guys read it I have to read it We agree that people get half their traits from their parents We think this is a trait from both of their parents Also for example that What For example if one person has one parent has Because for example for me I have my dad s eyes and I have my mom s my mom s She has traits from some from your mom and some from your dad okay Yeah It looks like you ve got someone who wants to say something about that But if what if you get more if you get some traits from your ancestors too and not just your parents What about your That would just go back a generation though Does that still support what you re thinking Yeah No because we re talking about the parents How they have half Yeah but you then also get from your parents some of them so some people don t look like their parents at all but they look like someone else in their family I m seeing this issue come up again What about grandparents Kids who look like their grandparents How does that happen Does anyone here wanna any of you guys Go ahead You still get it from your parents because your parents if your grandma has it then that trait is somewhere in your mom or your dad It just doesn t show up as much so it can transfer back to you What can we call that That there s a trait in you and you just don t see it Does anyone know a word for that Invisible I heard it over here Recessive Yes recessive okay Who else has heard recessive Raise your hands Scientists call a recessive gene a gene that does not express itself It doesn t mean it s a little gene that s quiet It just means that it s a gene that s not showing Or a trait sorry a trait that s not showing That s called recessive You also want to talk about this more a little bit more let s stay on this topic I think it will help us figure it out Yes Ryan Like he was saying it s probably about the DNA strands when they when two people combine in different parts or put in different pieces of it like maybe one like maybe the blue eyes is out and brown eyes goes in there Or maybe when they have one of those recessive genes the recessive genes get it goes into the strand too Maybe when Tyler said that none of neither of his parents have blue eyes maybe his grandpa or his grandma or their grandparents maybe one of them had blue eyes and it was in his mom or his dad and it went into the strand that he was created from It didn t show up in the mom but then it popped up in the kid Yeah Okay David I don t know I think I don t know if I agree with him but I think I kind of do because like he said it was dominant but he still has he still has a little bit in him so it s kind of like a well because you still have some of your traits or your parents still kind of have a little bit How are okay how are how is this idea that brown eyed kids have I m sorry brown eyed there s more traits in brown eyes right Is that what this idea is about All you guys right here How is that like this one That we get half from mom and half from dad Or how can we use some of this thinking and layer it onto some of this thinking so they re both right The question is how are those two the same Right How are that one and this one the same How are pieces from this how do we use pieces from this idea that Lorenzo is bringing up dominant and recessive how do we use pieces from this and combine it with pieces from this group over here Let me get you to talk about that with your group Let me ask I ll ask that question one more time What s right about what these guys are saying and how can we add it to stuff this group is thinking What if the kid is born blind right Or what if the kid comes out deaf and blind some express themselves and some don t Woo That you just gave me a brain scan because you read my mind Say there s two DNA strands One in this hand one in this hand They combine The dominant ones from each of these take over and make one of all the dominant ones that were in them Can you give me an example With Tyler maybe there was a dominant gene The blue eyes was dominant Maybe it was passive before it started whatever it s called recessive and then it became dominant but over time and then it went in Tyler How can a dominant gene become a recessive gene and become dominant again Maybe every time it gets passed down Hmm Like with us we get bigger What if your if your mom had two blue eyed parents but Ryan here today And they combine I found it All right are we ready to pull back All right I didn t get to hear from all these two groups but I did get to hear from them I think what this group has is something good and I think you guys want to hear it you re gonna be the spokesperson for that group Great We agree that people get mom and 50 from their dad We think this because if there s two people who made the baby then it s logically should be split in half But all every time someone has a baby all of their genes of both parents go into the baby Only some of them decide to express themselves and show Go ahead Say I have two DNA strands from two different people Say Mary and Joe Mary and Joe both had grandparents that both have blue eyes and that gene got passed down to them Now they combined to make one gene Say Mary had blue eyes had a blue eyed gene and Joe had a blue eyed gene Those two genes combined to make one dominant blue eyed gene and it goes in like what Tyler like with Tyler Right so we Tyler he used you as an example Your parents both have brown eyes right Mm hmm And what were you guys saying about his parents both have brown eyes but something they had something else too Yeah Because everyone kind of has a little bit of everything in them it s just some some color or some trait just decides to show because it s more dominant You know the movie you know the movie that movie They went to some place and they went to go get found out they got the book from some person and they matched it up to ours and it was different colors so they had different kind of genes for like for things So if you compare a baby who has blue eyes and one who has brown eyes it s gonna have it s gonna have different things with the eyes The DNA thing will be different Maybe those DNA genes that in a DNA maybe they would look different for a blue eyed person than a brown eyed person Yeah Did you wanna say something Maybe the DNA of Tyler s parents for example if their grandparents had blue eyed DNA accumulating in them it might have been passed down through them And then when they got to where they were forming Tyler inside their his mom s stomach it might have the blue DNA might have overpowered combining those two blue DNAs by getting it might have overpowered the brown eyes which made Tyler get the blue eyes 50 It could be like 50 That happened in my family They re saying what color eyes are your parent s Tyler What s your mom s eye color Brown Oh Yeah what you got on your mom s side From my brown eyed mom Brown So what about your mom s mom What about your dad s What about your dad All right you guys let s talk Let s talk for a second If we ve got an example of one person in science you never hang everything on one person Let s be careful about that And we don t want to have him be the reason for all But this is a good example Do we think that people can have genes in them that aren t showing but then they can have a kid and then those genes pop up Yeah because if the two genes Did you want to say something about it Lorenzo Yeah because I think that if a parent had brown eyes and one had blue eyes but the brown eyed parent also had some blue eyed genes then the baby would probably come out blue because it has the blue eyed gene and then half of the blue eyed gene from the other parent How could we figure out how we get our traits for sure Because we have a lot of ideas but what in science class what will we do What kind of activity could we do What kind of research could we do How would we find out We could go on AskJeeves com and we So we could look it up on the Internet Okay guys one resource we could look at How else could we figure this out We could take a survey Didn t we do that the class We did No But we could whole school so we have more to research or more I don t know Make a larger sample size Then we get information and we find out that X percent of our students have brown eyes and X percent of our students have blue eyes How does that help us find out where those traits came from It gives us more of an idea Their parents and their grandparents too And their great grandparents We d have to ask people to we d have to ask people to do some research on their families Okay so we could do some family research Sonja We could make up an assignment Sure Okay 
 It s similar to when we had the hand warmer What happens is when you add heat energy to the hand warmer it makes the water rise up So in the glass in the two liter bottle in the glass too the heat lamp added heat to it the heat energy Then the water started to rise up Of the water okay So why do you think the water spilled over last time I think that it s because of the molecules expanding Okay And then the molecules didn t have enough room Well the water didn t have enough room so it had to get out So then it popped out through the tube Okay Do you share the same idea Yeah Do you agree with her Yes Okay Alright Let s talk about this Yes I have something Like with mine we thought that since there was oxygen I mean there was a glass tube that the water had room to expand and like spill out So what s why it did Okay thank you Alright Let me ask you something How many of you put that water molecules expanded Raise your hand As a reason for water spilling Alright Okay They gave you the reason why right So who can tell me why you put that Alright Rebecca I put that because well you see it Well in the bottle lab we had water in there so when it heated up they expanded and they didn t have enough room so they had to it had to come out So molecules got bigger right Yeah If you don t believe molecules got bigger what did you guys think that the water spilled over Yeah I think if the water molecules didn t get bigger I think that the heat caused them to move around and bump into each other Okay so what is the evidence for both of these You played with the water heater Where is the evidence to support this Anybody Anthony Like what I think is that that the steam is like mostly involved with this cause the only type of air water has is steam And like since the water was heated so intensely it had to let out all the air it contained So it spewed out steam Okay thank you very much Good job I m gonna go over with Moorea Why do you think that water You didn t agree with water molecule being expanding right Yeah So what is your evidence that it is not expanding Well I think when we added the heat to the water I think the molecules started getting hotter and the heat was transferred from the lamp to the molecules and they started moving around more Kind of like how sugar makes people like have a sugar rush and kind of move around more and get more excited And then they just needed more room so they spilled out into the tube Okay Now let me ask you something If that is true how come if I press it here it s going down Why Yes Tyshon Because of the heat in your hand What s happening the heat of my hand Right Saron So it goes down faster because the heat in your hand is enclosing around the top I guess So it will make it come down Jake I m not sure but I think it goes down faster yes because of everybody else saying that when you hold from the heat of your hand But I think it s also because gravity pushes things down Okay Alright Alec has two finger means he has something to add I agree with Jake And I also think that since the water went down it s because it had more room at the bottom So when you put your hand around it it immediately goes down also because of gravity and how it has more room How did you come up with that answer Well when you were holding the top I saw that the bottom was empty And like so I thought that cause of gravity when you hold it at the top it has more room to go down But if you hold the bottom Look at the whole bottom Hold the bottom What s happening It s right there It s against the gravity It s going up So hold on I m gonna provide the evidence about the result This is computer simulation Watch this carefully I want you to watch this carefully And look at this The right side is water Okay the right side is water And did I turn the heat on Yeah Yeah Okay So who turned it off I m gonna reset it Okay And then heat is off Watch Look at air and water molecule Let s look at the water molecules first since we re doing the liquid part Are you with me Yeah Alright What is happening to water molecule Write it down with your group You ve got 30 seconds Talk to the group Molecules are vibrating very slightly Since the water s mostly cooled down more than the air it s more stable It s like doesn t vibrate as much as air cause water is like more still and more like a solid than air Okay Please observe everything And I m going to be asking you questions Alright And here we go I m gonna turn the heat on As a group you need do discuss and write everything down what you see here Just the air I mean I m sorry Just observe the water yes Everything okay Here we go Group Water only Okay now discuss with your group Alright Water only The water molecules they aren t moving around like the air ones but they re vibrating They re moving like back and forth They re vibrating like really violently They re staying in the same general area Like But the water ones are like I m sorry the molecules in the air are bouncing around and when the heat is applied they start bouncing around faster I agree with Maor but I think that with the air ones that they have more room to bounce around That the water is all contained in one thing So the molecules have to stay in one position but the air has to What do you think ladies You haven t said anything I think the same thing as Maor because the air molecules have more room to the surrounding because it s really nothing in there And since water is a liquid it has less room Whatever I see that the more the heat gets on the water Alright 30 more seconds So we re gonna start the discussion There are people who need more time to write but you already know what to do So here we are Okay I m gonna call on individuals so please do so You don t have to stand up Ivree I saw that when you turned on the lamp it started vibrating faster than Which one We re talking about which one The water Okay Vibrating faster Joon Po you think through The temperature also started rising very little Excellent Dylan what else did you notice I m noticing that when the heat is on the water is starting to vibrate very fast when it s turned on but they are staying stationary they re not actually moving anymore So why do you think the water molecules are vibrating Chelsea Because of the heat that is going on to the molecules So what you re saying is the heat source is going to molecules Class What do you call the heat source Which is the lamp What is it Heat energy Heat energy Very good So in this case I don t know if you agree with Chelsea Raise your hand How many of you disagree Raise your hand Alright How many of you agree with Chelsea Raise your hand Okay Alright The molecules are transferring energy The heat energy is transferring heat to the energy Thank you very much Now next part I m going to give you a life problem to solve And I want you to come up with solutions Okay How many like to play ping pong Oh excellent You know I grew up playing ping pong because in Asian culture ping pong s a lot cheaper to purchase than basketballs So most every home has ping pong or ping pong table because it s easy to make out of wood Now having said that Suppose you received a set of ping pong balls for holiday because you asked for it from your parents and your parents being really nice and you behaved really well They decide to give you these ping pong balls you got The problem is you lost all of them except one And your best friend came over to play with this But he stepped on it on accident So now here s a dent Right he has to fix it Can you fix it You re all worried Because you ve never seen anybody can fix this So give me some suggestions by talking to your group Alright You have buddies back up there alright Kind of like the water bottle right Especially like you can fix another part Maybe you could do the same thing with the ping pong ball Like if you start to squish the ping pong balls down and maybe you could its place It d be easier to pop it out I think you can apply air You can apply air like with heat Like at least heat Cause you know when the heat was added to the water Right Like you could apply air with a little Do you need more time Like the thing Okay So I m going to write the solution alright by asking group that has an answer Just stand up one at a time the group that hasn t answered yet Alright So here s a solution Say ping pong ball dilemma Alright Okay number one Which group is gonna be Just stand up Just stand up if you haven t spoke in this group We already thought that you could try and use your hands and like pop the air back into it and get it to its original shape Okay Alright number two Something different Which group that hasn t spoken yet Okay Chelsea s group Alec said that if you push around the edges it might pop back into shape So kind of the same thing Yes We think that somehow if you maybe poked a hole in it you can use like an air pump or some sort of machine to get the air in it and maybe the air will push against the dent And make it a sphere again Let s see how many of you believe this dilemma raise your hand Okay Alright How many of you believe this is gonna work Raise your hand How many believe this is gonna work Alright Is there a third option anybody Okay Yes I don t know if this will work but maybe you can put in front of a lamp Okay Excellent start But why would you put it in front a lamp Let me ask you something Maybe so that the molecules in it like in the water example maybe they ll start like vibrate No you re okay Well it s air so You want to add heat energy right Yeah you want to add heat Alright so we re gonna try all of those So let s try with number one So I m going to give Sasha a ping pong ball that s been dented by my best friend Or not my best friend Her best friend so she s gonna try to do it Okay number two is what Pop a hole in it So how many of you disagree with this Or of this idea Why would you disagree with this idea Dylan Because if you poked a hole in it it would be kind of like ruin it and release all this stuff and it would be kind of hard to Okay What are you ruining in this case The ping pong ball In other words What you re saying is a surface of the thing Yeah Okay Did you try Yeah like it s really hard So it s actually hard to pop it back in Let s see Who s strong Me Okay You re strong She wants to do it If she doesn t work then let s do it Okay how about the lamp Lamp thingy So Let s see Are you the one that says the Come on over Okay Leave it like this Turn the heater on Okay On the top yeah that s it The other way There you go Right there Yeah there you got it Oh okay Oh what happened It helps if it s connected isn t it Okay Try that again There So we re gonna time it While we re working on this for a couple minutes Okay Alright Okay Alright So who has the ping pong now The dent was too strong Okay now Look at the ping pong ball I m gonna show it to you Okay look You saw it right All of you What happened It has more dents Not only the dent What else It broke Is this gonna work That s completely ruined What did that do Nothing Alright so let s say first idea is no good Okay So second idea poke a hole We agreed that it s not gonna work because it s gonna compromise How many of you agree with that It s gonna compromise the shape of the thing Okay Alright the third idea Alright It s about a minute Nothing s happening Okay Do you have any other suggestions Who hasn t said anything Sydney I think maybe you could like put it between your hands because it might work the same as the lamp but just faster Okay So how many agree that looks like both of you if I m not mistaken that you have to have some kind of heat right You said because I said because like the water it needs room to expand Well it s not actually expanding but it needs room to move so the ball will probably expand Okay I m gonna show you this simulation Is there something Yes Dylan Yeah I want to add Maybe it would work better under a stronger heat source Okay like a sun Yeah like Okay Can I tell you something that I did before the class I put it under the lighter and the ping pong went like pshhh You know to be honest with you the ash was big as this one That was it I was looking for ping pong ball It ll burn Alright now I want to show you this simulation again Okay So bear with me here You all said the two things I m gonna talk about You all said the molecules were expanding meaning molecules are getting bigger right Tell me Is this molecule getting bigger No Okay so molecules are not getting bigger How many of you believe it s not getting bigger Remember simulation is evidence Is that what is happening Like many of you said already Jake They re moving around really fast in the space For air and water they re vibrating So look at the air this time Alright The air So class which one would you say is moving faster Air Okay So air is moving faster Okay we re gonna discuss this next step So everyone s gonna get a big picture You have a question I need to see the finger thing Yes I have a I guess reason Well I have another thing that I noticed about that I guess you could say I think that the reason why the water molecules are moving slower is because the water is taking up space and they can t travel around that fast because in the air there s really nothing in there that s stopping them from moving But I guess you can compare it to us when we re swimming under water We move slower than we normally do on land Yeah So air molecules are moving really fast right So what s happening as it s moving very fast Sydney you have something to add Okay I was just gonna say if you look at water it sort of looks like it s in an invisible cage And it s trying to move around but it can t So it s restricted It doesn t move as well 
 Look at your station one information And the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather And yesterday you guys constructed a graph to show that data Why is it useful to construct a graph in science class Sky Because it s a visual way to show you information It s a visual way to show you information I have a case up here as an example Based on that graph what does that pattern reveal about our question Gabrielle The cooler the temperature the more the I mean more increases in time The more what increases in time The more uh weather Okay anybody want to restate that Rebecca The colder it is the more time it takes to weather Very good The colder it is the more time it takes to weather If we re talking about dissolving a tablet is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering Logan Chemical weathering Chemical weathering So the colder it is the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur Would you agree Thumbs up or thumbs down Thumbs up I would agree Now I want to talk about so what Why does it matter to us Why does it matter in our daily lives Talk about it for one minute record your thoughts on your wipe board and be ready to share back We could consider where to build our stuff In what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot What about up north You ve got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts Okay it might dissolve faster in a warmer place Or what type of rock would I want to avoid Limestone why Okay very good very good Alright let s share some of our ideas with the class Info managers table three what did you find If you live in a cold environment there will be less chemical weathering than there is in a warm place Good point if you live in a cooler environment there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate Who s gonna be particularly concerned with this What for instance job field is gonna be concerned with this idea Forrest Construction That would be one area what else Statue building Yeah any kind of artist who s designing statues What type of rock would you want to avoid if you re living in a warm area And you know that chemical weathering could be a problem What rock would you avoid Patrick Limestone Limestone Do you guys have some proof for me Somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone Which station Alex Station three Flip to station three for me At station three who can explain to me what the lab was that you did Someone I haven t heard from Colin We put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk And the chalk didn t dissolve in the water but the acid made it fizz bubble and it was just dissolving And why did we use chalk What is chalk a type of What is chalk a type of Jeremy It s a type of limestone It s a type of limestone So your evidence showed that yes limestone weathers quickly with acid Why is acid a part of our environment How does it become part of our environment Andrea Acid rain Acid rain acid rain Now as we grow up it s important that you re environmental advocates That you fight for protecting our environment What types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain Give me two ideas on your wipe boards Two ideas Is that polluting our water our air Polluting the air and it s getting into our clouds Very nice very good So air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation You are making worst case scenarios You don t have to consider the unthinkable It can happen alright You don t have to consider the impossible So we can unplug outlets when we re not using them We can turn off the water when we brush our teeth What about things in your house Electricity Cut down on your electric bills Remember you burn fossil fuels to make electricity So right now as middle schoolers the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use Alright I want every table to share one idea Info manager from table one give me one idea One idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school instead of like everybody having their own individual cars Good point Or even better you can walk Instead of having that carpool line going on let s take busses Table two give me one idea Save power by changing your lightbulbs to CFLs Yeah use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs they use a lot less electricity good idea Table three give me one Conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth Now conserving water Think about what the question was How can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain We can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets Very good Unplug items from the outlets that s good Table four We could use hybrid cars Hybrid cars that s good They burn less fossil fuels good idea Table five Recycle Recycle How would that help acid rain Okay so it s cutting down on factory use that would be a good one Table six Cutting down on electricity Alright cutting down on electricity because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels Table seven is there any that haven t been said Carpool to work and school Carpool to work and school I love it You got something to add I was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them Yeah very good A lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling but it s good to reuse too That s a good idea as well So we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering We haven t yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering Which lab would answer that question How temperature affects mechanical weathering Station four Alright look at station four Take one minute you don t have to write this one down discuss it What does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life Take one minute And it like ice wedges and then it ll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks What were you supposed to be measuring In centimeters You measured in milimeters but you meant to measure in centimeters So how much was it in centimeters Well if you said it was at 79 which would be right there What centimeters is that at Around 15 Write down 15 Oh wait wait I had it going the wrong way and no one even noticed So if it was at 79 where would it be At 79 the tick mark right below the 80 About 16 About 16 and if it was at 76 where would it be at About 14 and a half Very good Alright let s pick someone at random who s the lucky person Andrew P What did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid When it was frozen it was taller When it was frozen it was taller What does that mean that it was taller Lucy Well the water was frozen to ice So it expands a little It expands I like the use of that word Water expands as it freezes Here in Louisville how is that a problem And it s been a particularly big problem this winter Ethan Because like the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings Soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads Right very good point Now that affects us here in Kentucky because we have those cold winters What types of areas would it not affect Forrest Florida Florida areas that don t have freezing that s a good point Now we ve talked about climate as far as temperature goes We ve talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering What is the other aspect of climate other than temperatures Other than temperature what is another aspect of climate Patrick How humid it is How humid it is Which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather Flip through Sky Seven Let s look at station seven Now during our labs the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready A material manager Can someone explain to me what s the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup What would that difference be Lucy Well the steel wool that was covered well the steel wool that wasn t covered with the cup it was all like stuck together and it wasn t rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out like it wasn t all stuck together and it was rusting Okay so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened had a lot of rust And the one that was moistened but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust Would you agree Okay what is the purpose of covering it Why do I cover that Otis Keeping the water from evaporating Yeah it s keeping that water in So is the covered cup a dry environment or a humid environment Humid environment A very humid environment I have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas and tells you what their humidity is like I m gonna flip off both lights to help you see it This is a tropical wet area tropical dry area semi arid which means dry arid then marine west coast Mediterranean and humid sub tropical These areas that are marked as humid sub tropical such as down in Florida those areas that are marked as humid what do they have to be cautious about If it s a humid area what do they have to be cautious about Don t see a lot of hands talk about it for one minute What do humid areas have to be cautious about Now think about this an area like Kentucky And our summers aren t just hot they re humid So we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering and we have to deal with Yeah so we re kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios Yes we definitely are Good point Alright I need someone I haven t heard from to share let s see who the random card is Lucy What do you think They have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff They have to be careful of rusting Good point Because the more humid the air is the more likely you are to have what Oxidation Now there was another lab where we used steel wool What was the purpose of the other steel wool lab What were you trying to answer what were you trying to determine Jamiel what do you think There was the key word the what kind of water Salt water You look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate You look to see if salt water did Silently look at your data and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Jeremy did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Yeah 
 This one is probably medium So this one is mine So this has to be a medium And this one has to be a large because My medium is half way up to here So it has to be a large So you make a prediction about how many small rocks it takes to make a big I think it s gonna be 12 small rocks That s a good idea Put our small rocks we have here so we make it draw two little blocks and if we have 12 Draw a rectangle and just put put your line through right here What do you think how many small rocks I think that there is going to be eight We have eight rocks So I think that there s going to be What about you I have 10 11 12 Boys and girls I had a good question If you ve got more rocks than you do boxes you know that we ve got how many boxes How many boxes Ten There s ten So at the top you can write since we ve been working with place value with tens and ones you can put ten We know that s how many boxes we have You could put plus six if you have which number 16 16 If you all had 11 what could you do You got ten so you would write plus one If you had 12 you would write you ve got 10 so what would you write above it Plus two So you can do it that way Good question Now what about you make a prediction of five then you ask us how many baby rocks we think that ten makes I think that there is going to be These can be large And there s one two three four four larges He s already told you how many mediums there are However you think Very good So you ve got yours sorted by size or you could see if there s another way you can sort your rocks We just did size first so we could do our work Very smart Very smart Tell me about looking at the graph how many small you had Diana How many small rocks were there Five Alright how many medium rocks did you have 11 And how many large Four Good good and you sorted them Oh you got some nice rocks Oooh Nice rock there it s pretty Neat Now this looks much better much better Medium there s one two three four five six seven eight nine Three four five six seven eight nine 10 Wait wait One two three four five Now we need five more to make 15 One two three four five six seven eight nine Four five six seven eight nine I counted 14 Put them together One two three four I d say like maybe it goes with the white Okay what about this one That goes with the white right What about this one Hmm I d say like what does it have the most of I d say probably white What about this one This one goes for tan This one is this one goes This one goes too This goes with the gray too This one goes to the I think it goes It goes with the white Now let s see I think it s a pretty rock Wait oh That one goes there I know it They all do Wait these go with the green No this one this one is gray It s still got sand in it This one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish I d say like maybe green too We ll have all yes Okay now this rock Okay Diana Cam and Gaelin What I want you to do is you ll probably how about you just take the rocks Because I can t remember What s going on We re sorting them a different way You re sorting them a different way And what way would that be How did you all decide to sort rocks I thought we d sort them by color and now we re gonna do it by cut Tell me that again because I don t I don t know that part Now since we did the color we re going to do is we re going to do by texture What s texture It s by how it feels Oh well can you teach me Find out the texture from these two rocks I see how it feels And since this one feels very smooth I ll put it by itself Well can I feel it Pretty smooth Pretty smooth Have you felt it Feel it How you think it feels Smooth It does feel pretty smooth And it looks like a piece of meat It looks like a piece a meat Yes Better not eat a rock should I Okay where does this one need to go It needs to go Over here We haven t finished quite yet so Okay And this one is like I ll say pretty rough Pretty rough can I feel this one Oh gosh Whoo Yeah It does feel a little rough It does feel like it s got some sand on it You know a word that I can think of that makes me think of that Rough Rough or gritty You know sand is gritty feeling Well that s kind of gritty It does feel a little rough It can stand up It stands up I m gonna do it put it by itself Okay And we re going to keep on doing it Until all of them are sorted Okay this is a pretty cool rock how does it feel I ll say pretty bumpy kind of rock Pretty bumpy pretty rough Oh this one s very rough So rough I can hardly stand myself Look at the shell on it It does have a shell in it On the other side look On the other side turn it like right here it has another shell It does so what kind of rock would this be A two fossil rock A fossil rock And what kind are they what s it called If it has a fossil imprint in it Fossil If it settled and got a fossil Sedimentary It would be a sedimentary rock Very cool I m so proud of you That was definitely very rough Have you felt it This is What do you think On the back is kind of squishy It is rough Okay you all keep working you re doing a good job I m proud of you Okay Now you can put it with the rough the super rough I think this one is I can tell I say medium a little rough a little smooth This one goes in the middle This one is smooth This is super rough Let me feel Smooth I m gonna put it in the middle because I think Very good Arianna I like the way you One more medium rock than large Because we have eight medium and seven large Because you can see A smooth side and a rough side Because if you add two more together it make 12 Medium is seven and large is eight And I have an idea when you do your rock what about you trace it 
 It s probably three Because five to the third is 125 Alright so let s test that out Can I use my calculator You can have your guy test it out here Oh The other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this This is something that is unusual because it s got that subscript Read that first line up at the top where it says pronouncing logarithmic equations Log base b of x equals y Yeah so can you transfer that pronunciation to for example the one in example six How would you say that out loud Log base two of eight equals It s three Equals three So that s how we say these things out loud Log base two of eight The little number this subscript is the base Keep going you guys are doing fantastic Speak up The log of 10 000 is four Forgot I don t have a pencil You re off No pencil In number nine is it one For number nine Yeah When the log when the base is equal to X When B is equal to X it will be one So would 10 be negative one Uh 10 yeah negative one Oh I think I get it now And then 11 would be Negative three Negative three yeah It s like the power stable thing you know Yeah It s like four to the y would be equal to this Yeah So 12 and 13 would be zero Let s see Yeah Yep Okay Pretty easy Yeah and What s 14 14 is one half So again what you re saying is If it s a fraction or if like like for 14 Yeah It d be a fraction So 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half Yeah So that what about that one made you think it s going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers The other ones were integers because in the log the little exponent there Mmhm is less than the actual number Okay let s work on the pronunciation because this is something that s brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud Let s go back up to the top where it says read this out loud So Matt I ll have you Are you the what is your role here We re professors here Oh so that s a good role for you So why don t you speak that out loud Log base root of x equals y Yeah now I want you to say the first example out loud Log base of log base five of 25 equals 2 Yeah so it s hard to pronounce it Yeah But the little number that s down is what Uh base Yeah so it s the base So when we say it we re gonna say base little number whatever it is Alright so now say what you were saying before either of you guys You told me why it comes out a fraction How will you recognize it comes out a negative number When the y or when the x is a fraction and the log base is a whole number Okay yeah so like which examples do that Ten and eleven Alright that s good How will you recognize if it comes out as zero See any patterns for the ones that log If the x is a 1 Alright yeah Why does that make sense Have you figured it out Like any number to the power of 1 is itself or no it s zero Or I mean not any number to the power of zero is one Exactly Alright you re very you re getting right to the idea of what a log is How will you recognize the ones that will come out one without calculating X equals the base Okay well said Why does that make sense in terms of exponents Cause if you divide itself it ll equal one Can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one Because that s the next thing we re going to try to do Seven to the fifth power Seven to the one equals seven Good having done all of this can you say what a log is in one word A single word It s like the power of Mmhm it s the exponent Yeah Good a log is an exponent Now what I d like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is yeah Woah oh oh oh oh It would be Don t stop So it s gotta be two Take the so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number So right to the there Yeah so 32 Something with Something to the fourth Yeah Maybe five five to the fourth Five to the Execuse you So 59 is One 52 equals one So it d be 59 Yeah 18 would be Just three Is it a thousand Yeah a thousand You put ten thousand I have a question Yeah For this one what s the for this one what s the log No well yeah I don t know The log of what I think I understand your question but you first have to figure out the way to read these things Read that part that first because the pronunciation is challenging at first Log base b of x equals y Alright so now read example Well we know example four is three So the log is three So read example four out loud So log three of 27 equals three Good except I want you to say the word base in there Okay log base three of 27 equals three Perfect so I think your question was about examples seven and eight So what s the base Wouldn t the base be one it s just not there It s not there Here s the question the answers the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight Go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation What s equivalent to that Oh if it s not there the base is ten Alright so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven Ten squared equals 100 Ten squared equals 100 Does it still work for that Is that void Mmhm Because it would be ten to the fourth equals But I thought he just said the base was one Well he said the base was one He thought it might be Oh it s not It turns out it s ten Okay So the base if not written is ten I want you to check this two ways Who s our calculator person here Alright so Brandon I want you just to type in the log but just use this button It s next to the seven Just type in log of 100 So if he doesn t use any base it comes out as two Now try it with the log base on the new operating system log base ten of 100 Log base ten of 100 Mmhm See if that still works Two It turns out it s sort of optional If there s no base what is the base Nothing No it s a certain thing So if there s no base written like all of the other ones had a base written Okay If there s no base written it s saying what s the number to raise a certain base to to get 100 And this one came out two So what s the number that you can use as a base squared to get 100 Ten Yeah so if there s no base the base applied is ten And it turns out you can write it or not So what I d like you guys to do is as you re working through these also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you re taught So just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again Yeah sure And the one s at the bottom you can t just type into the calculator So you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there Then for like any number in there That s a really good insight How come that s the case Because anything to the zero power is one You got it Yeah Except for one number There s one number you can t put there Zero Yeah good job You got it good job Thank you 20 would be 81 I wasn t even close So ten alright so ten to the third would be 1000 For 18 wouldn t it be a thousand supposed to be base is implied to be ten Ten to the third would be 1000 I m not sure For 18 I don t know Alright Alright say it again except this time include the word base Log base of log base of eight Wait log base of eight equals zero Close Log base eight Log base eight of one equals zero That s it exactly yeah Okay So we say base where s the base always on a log equation Under the exponent Yeah its a subscript it s down A subscript So I d like you to pronounce number 12 Log three of one equals zero Close I want you to get the word base in there Log base three of one equals zero Yeah and that way if you re always saying what the base is when you create an equivalent exponential function it s going to be a lot easier So next to each one of these let s do a few together Let s do the top row going one six 11 I want you to write an exponential equation using 5 25 and 2 So it would just be five squared equals 25 Exactly What s the base in that equation It s five Yeah So you did two cubed equals eight Yeah Yeah so now you recognize you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent Yeah that s good Each of these numbers is an exponent What d you notice about the ones that came up zero Would you be able to recognize those and predict Any number works for it Really What do you mean any number works for it For this one Oh I see for that last one You could put any number here other than zero Yes I thought it was one but they had got it One works but so does two So does two three four and five I m wondering about the ones like 12 and 13 How would you predict or recognize in the future that the log is going to be zero If it has a one for the X For the X yeah Mmhm yep I think there s a fancy mathy word called a characteristic for that But we don t use that word very often But yeah you could say the x cause that s how it showed up in our first equation Sure How will you recognize that it s going to come out a negative number If it has a fraction in it Mmhm As the X Okay well said yeah Why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents On the green chart whatever is on the left side and whatever s left Yeah Our powers table You re talking about all of our fractions here Yeah How about the ones that came out with one as the log The log was one They have the same base and the same x value And what about this one This is a fraction so Yeah how come it had a negative log Well I know it s because it s a fraction Can you write an equivalent exponential equation Two to the no two to the negative one Mmhm equals it doesn t equal this right Actually it does Two to the negative one equals half Okay Yep Okay so that s correct 
 Our is like Crown Crown Royal and like it shows like a helmet and like an ad for it and it says He who wears the crown I think that s like if you wear the helmet you will seem cool Mm hmm and the helmet is for what do you think Motorcycles or cars kind of racing kind of stuff And Crown Royal tobacco or alcohol Alcohol and racing a car Thoughts Drinking and driving Huh Well that s bad But they appeal to your your uh love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff but those two don t really mix do they Next group Ours is tobacco and it has a picture of a firefighter and it says A bit braver so it s trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver and trying tobacco So the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver What do you think Could it really work If I chew tobacco Am I gonna be able to fight a fire No But firefighting appeals to a lot of young children right That bravery that toughness that rugged fireman thing It s like if I do chewing tobacco I m a rugged fireman type Um what are my teeth gonna look like though Yellow Not gonna look like the rugged fireman type am I Fireman sounds like he smiles is that what you said All right um ladies Um ours was alcohol and um they got our attention by like the grandma and the daughter playing patty cake and telling stories about her So grandma and daughter and granddaughter playing patty cake lovely little sunny porch sponsored by Budweiser Oh my Oh that s so popular So drink You re appealing to the family nature And the message is drink our drink Yeah it says that like all stories weren t about family they also had some other stuff Family and Budweiser Yeah No Yeah you re getting it now All right Ladies Um ours is um There s isn t really an ad There s is a display at a grocery store Yeah like there is um a whole bunch of like alcohol in the background and up closer there s tobacco and then there s a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids Right next to the The tobacco Tobacco okay Candy bars Like right there and then um also you have pretty much the candy Alcohol behind the booth tobacco right up front and candy bars right at hand level Kids would probably think that tobacco s candy They might Or as good as candy Does tobacco come in flavors like candy does Yeah No Yes it does Oh Mint berry apple Ew really Really Hey I think I missed a group Did I miss a group This one up front Nope Did I get you guys already Did you guys share Oh you did share just with me Share with the rest of the group It s Ours is alcohol and like if you re a rockstar you ll drink like if you drink this then you will become a rockstar What hook did they use The girls in bikinis So how many guys are in that picture One One guy and he s the one who s drinking the alcohol and Fifteen girls Fifteen girls in bikinis So if the message is if you drink this You ll get hot girls You ll get hot girls yeah All right you ve had a chance to let Oh sorry Eyes Ears Mouth Thanks You ve had a chance to look at these ads Um you ve got a chance to see how they re trying to hook you in You re knowing that the messages that they re sending are slightly warped It s their trick to pull you in but it s your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills Weigh it out Consider but then choose something else that s healthier So we ve looked at negative influences It s time to talk about positive influences in your life things that can help you say no to all of that no matter how appealing it is no matter how many girls in bikinis show up Leave your cards right where they are in the center It s time to take a look at the charts that are around the room There are five of them These are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs alcohol tobacco like a social activity um something you can do with someone else Ideas Have a sleepover Sleepover good All right so in just a few minutes we re gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings We re gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this Can anyone name one physical activity something you can do that would be instead of using drugs a positive thing Football Yeah Did you want to share too Go ahead Um riding your bike around the block Good You re on the right track guys Keep those ideas in your head When you get to the chart you ll have to write it down What s something you can do with your brain a mental activity that would be positive Chess Chess I like chess Math Not for everybody I understand Um this chart over here says Emotional What s something you can do um that can make your emotions feel better your passions or whatever How can you support yourself emotionally so you can say no to this Trying to think happy Yep Positive thoughts Watching emotional movies Definitely gets your mind off those I know you got great ideas and I m gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes so save them in your head Okay The last one is spiritual Spiritual Somehow you can nurture your spirit so you have the ability to say no to negative influences Go to church Church All right Save it You ll get a chance Time to look at your pencils again Leave your papers right where they are okay Face up This time we re gonna go by color and you might notice that there are markers at each station for the right color So when you get to the station if you are patience I promise I ll explain it No worries When you get to your station we re gonna start with your bag of colors You will take your bag of colors and your marker and you will only use your color marker So if you are a green guy you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first You ll write down however many ideas you want You ll talk it out with your group You might notice Mitchell that I also put group work uh reminders up here about how to work with others in your group One everybody has the right to speak so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to and to write it down the topic Don t interrupt Give everybody a chance to share their side Two everybody has the right to be respected We re not looking for put downs We re looking for ones that can encourage us positive things so when you re getting ready to write positive things speak positively to each other as well And three everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict So if you re having a difficulty in your group talk it out Work together to solve that problem If it s not working and you can t solve the problem who can you turn to for help You Me And others in your group So if you re a green person you re gonna get one green marker and there are multiple in here in case your marker doesn t work Get a different one Write down whatever ideas you want When you hear me say Switch or Rotate you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock Take your marker with you So there ll be multiple colors on here You ll get a chance to write on every one Yes How does this work Are you supposed to write it down like a list You can write all over that paper Yeah Anywhere as long as we re on the front Everywhere all over that paper so you can all be on there at the same time as you want you can take turns you can arrange however you and your group want to You each can have a marker though There s plenty of them for everyone Yellow s are over here at Emotional um I believe blue s are Social purple s are Physical and oranges are Mental Questions before we begin Think about something to do besides You ll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute so listen for me to say Switch Keep writing until I say it Go Here How about we take this and put it on the floor Does that work better I know it s going everywhere isn t it Here you go You guys want to take that one down too put it on the floor so it s a little easier to write on Yeah Good I know isn t it cool Yeah So I see you got chess on there Anyone think of some other ones Other mental ways to use your brain things you can think about it Think of school kind of activities things related to learning using the brain Spelling You can practice your spelling You can do your math I think you guys are in right place You have a lot of good ideas Tell me your favorite one so far Give him a spot Good How do you spell baseball Oh online The Playstation yeah that is definitely a social event I ve got XBox Live So social means involving what Talking to other people human beings a relationship with them All right Ready in 10 nine finish what you re writing eight seven six taking your marker with you in five Oh our marker Four Yep Your writing in your color Three two one rotate Spiritual All things that are spiritual What does that really mean Your spirit Your spirit yeah It could be feelings I think we did emotions though right Yeah So this one would be more nurturing your soul yourself We ve got meditation We ve got mediation right Yoga Oh yeah Why don t you write that one down How do you spell yoga Yes perfect The Bible poems How much do you connect with your spirit or your soul Any other resources or people Pastor from a church Friends you know from the church or wherever you attend services Who else besides a pastor can lead um a group You can pray Pray good You guys are on the right track Emotional support Where can we find emotional support Family friends good Who are some other resources for emotional support Culture How can we nurture your own good feelings What do you do to feel better Cuddle your pets Cuddle your pets You know that one s my favorite too It s okay you don t have to spell things All right capping markers Ready to move 10 nine eight seven six ready gentlemen in five taking your marker in four three two one Rotate 
 Right here Okay so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is Yeah Yes because your asymptote is where this would be undefined right So it s gonna be X equals what Positive two Positive but okay if we put positive two there we have two plus two So it d be negative two Negative two that s why we have an asymptote that X equals negative two okay Now is there another number out here No No so what would that other number be See there is one here but there s not one here So it d just be zero So it d just be zero So does that tell you what your other asymptote is Y equals zero cause f of x stands for that s your y isn t it Okay So you can tell by looking at the function itself what your asymptotes are gonna be Okay tell me what this asymptote s gonna be your x your vertical asymptote Zero Zero X equals zero so you re gonna be drawing your asymptote right there What about your y Remember how we covered this up and you would have y equals what Negative one Negative one y plus negative one So the function itself tells you your asymptotes doesn t it Okay does that help Yeah Okay All right so No but it s like that right here though But see she has negative two Right here Then how did she get the did we write the first one wrong then Cause x equals zero No because she got zero and negative two and that s what I got You wrote it down wrong Where Right here cause zero is supposed to be on top Oh so no never mind you got it right It s the same I just switched these around No but you re right because you know how x is vertical okay so for this one it s going to be the x is going to be negative 2 right Mm hmm Okay I got it So wait the asymptote isn t the same thing as the parent function right No Did you have the graph Did it turn out And how do you know up here Check this thing out Huh So what would the parent function be That s what I was trying to work out for you Did you find the parent function For what It s not x squared is it One over x All of them is going to be one over x Cause you can t just put x She said put a one divided by x That d be the parent function All right How do you know which is the parent function It s the one that s consistent That first one that you put It s the one that s exactly in between the first and third quadrant This is your parent function This is your parent function This one and this one right So blue right there and right there But you totally ruined it Yeah Yeah the colors I used are kind of weird Do you have a red Are you using it This is the graph right So if it s the first one and the third one right Hey wait that first thingy comes out at negative three not negative two Hm This first little line right here comes out negative three not negative two Is the parent function still I mean is the asymptote still negative two I think So how is one negative two You gotta switch it because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative so the y would be zero because it s not going to negative How would the y be zero the y is a negative You got em switched all you gotta do is switch em I m not understanding She busy Okay Oh I know why It s because we don t have no y in the equation Like this one it d have a y The y would be negative one And on this one we don t have it so automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two That makes more sense All right you got it Yeah I had to think about that So that s how you do it So then the asymptote is the right here Uh huh Which one So then the translation is the down one Wait what The translation is the down one So what is this down Let me plug it in Divide by x parentheses One over divided by x minus one Okay so we don t need no parenthesis No I m almost done You re crossing it that s the y yeah But that s the x This is x and this is y Yes Well look on the sheet It will show you that um I basically used this one as an example It s like the same type of format that the problem is Okay Okay yeah that makes sense So the asymptote is zero It says h equals x Yeah Yeah so zero yeah wait Yeah This is the graph you start with Yeah that makes more sense cause that s how the graph is Okay we got the asymptote X equals is it zero Yeah and then y equals negative one And the translation is one unit down Do you have a value Yeah Uh oh So it d be three units down We would put this on negative three cause that s y So since it s y we would have to put it on negative three and zero Right Cause it s the same as this Yeah And then y equals negative three Yeah x equals zero and y equals negative three Translation three units down Wherever the lines like go the furthest but don t touch Okay Oh you re just marking down the asymptotes Yeah She said she forgot yeah so I guess you can just put up there yellow Okay Are you on number four Yes So on number four it would be five units to the left Number four yeah yeah you re good Okay She just told me she just told I just wrote it wrong I guess then How do you know how to graph it with Like in the calculator In here And it s really not good to graph it here Yeah Okay This seems to be not that hard now that I get it Really Like remember how Grayson thought that it was three I knew she was wrong I mean I didn t think it was wrong You just instinctively knew that it was wrong Is it going to have a vertical shift also Yep up down down Okay up or down Down how many Two On number five Oh three It would be three Three Okay so you re going to have two shifts on number five right Okay Uh huh I haven t plugged it in yet We re going to have a shift here right What would make that undefined If x equals How about positive two Because two minus two is zero I mean the zero is where you needed to be So x equals two right Okay now what are we going to do with this thing out here That s a vertical shift of y equals negative three Y equals negative three So we have two translations okay Two units right and 
 Megan what quadrant am I going to be centered in Quadrant four Good okay so I m gonna go to the right six and down five I know my radius is three root seven Now this may be a little difficult for you because three root seven is kind of a hard number to wrap your mind around Any thoughts on how we can tell which quadrants this goes into I want to know if it goes into quadrant one first Twink what could we do Do you un simplify it so when it gets through the center it d be like square root of 63 and then you like have so it s in between eight nine or I know it s in between seven and eight Okay did you guys follow her on that Yeah Yeah okay so Twink knows that this decimal is going to be between seven and eight because she knows it s the square root of 63 And the square root of 64 is eight So it s just below eight All right So you may be able to picture a decimal in your mind close to eight but not quite so we re armed with that knowledge true or false this circle goes into quadrant one Melissa Agree No Ben Yes it does go into quadrant one Do you have anything to back that up Yeah because it only the center point is down six and if we go up one more than that at least James It s down five and since it s more than seven it s gotta be at least past the two There were a lot of pronouns there What James was saying is we re five units below the x axis the radius is seven point something units long so we re going to top out right around there There s the top of our circle okay Let s speed up this process a little bit here The is it going to go into quadrant three Yes Why Abby Simpson Because it s over six and yeah you count seven the other way Okay Or a little over seven So we re going to be there Oh and now for the great dilemma will this circle go into quadrant two Robert what am I going to have to resort to The distance formula I can t hear you The distance formula Okay give me some more pairs to plug into this formula William Zero sorry zero minus six squared and then zero plus five squared All right Now what is the square root of 61 in simplified radical form Rue Is it just square root of 61 Good maybe that was a trick question Maybe not it s not going to break down any further because 61 is what type of number again Prime Prime okay so we ve got square root of 61 Robert you told me to use distance formula I used distance formula I followed your orders to the T I still don t know if this goes into quadrant two or not It does not The circle doesn t make it to quadrant two No So you re saying it does this Yes Prove it Well if you actually put I don t know Call on someone else please Maddie Since you know that your radius is the square root of 63 and that s a larger number than the square root of 61 it therefore passes the origin and it goes into the opposite quadrant or quadrant two in this case So you re saying it goes like that Correct Is that good enough for your piece of mind The radius is longer than it needs to be to reach And therefore yeah you re right Moral of the story The circle goes through all four quadrants So far we ve kind of been in been there done that land and so now I m going to take you into some new stuff right now The x and y intercepts First the x intercepts of this graph How am I going to find where this circle collides with the x axis Let me ask an intermediate question what do you know about every x intercept in the universe They all have something in common Abby All of their lines like the y equals zero What I m sorry Okay all like the y s equal zero like the y Which variable Y Equals Zero One more time Y equals zero Okay does that makes sense to you guys Yeah Because if you do go up or down to plot your ordered pair I ve got bad news for you you re not on the x axis any more Thus it s not an x intercept All right just one more time Abby I forgot what you had said earlier Y equals zero Okay so how am I going to find my x intercepts here Twink I have a question does it like the circle cross over x like the x axis twice Well we ll find out if it does I mean sometimes doesn t it Yeah So what do you do if it does So this is the first time in your math careers where you might have two x intercepts Colliding once and coming back down and colliding again with the x axis that s good instincts And I ll just warn you right now yeah we re going to have two x intercepts here Maddie how are we going to find these two We use the formula of a circle and we plug in for y zero Okay so let s get the equation up here because I forgot to write it earlier Josh Ah I don t remember Ella May X squared X squared plus or minus six Or no x minus six Okay Squared plus y Plus five Squared equals 63 Okay Maddie now we have our equation and you said to do what to it Since you know you have when you re looking for an x intercept you re always going to have zero for your y Oh Abby told us that Yeah you have your y in that formula equal zero Literally literally Well we ve got to see what x is Ben Well I know but that s it Does it make sense to you Yeah It isn t that hard of a concept and that s why I had Abby repeat it eight times If you get that y literally has to be zero you understand why you literally make y zero and then solve for x We re finding here s one of the ordered pairs right here that we re searching for and I ll be darned if the y is gonna be zero The question is what s the x All right so I ve got x minus six squared Plus I m just going to write five squared equals 63 So according to my calculations we have that right there Mason You forgot that middle term It should be minus 12 x Yeah or something like that You forgot the middle term You forgot like the something x Yeah it d be x squared minus 12 x and then plus 36 Oh so I need to square both those terms Yes no wait what d you say I just wanted to square the x and square the negative six No you didn t you wanted to square the whole thing Okay which means we utilize what process in math What s that called again Twink Foil Foil we had forgotten our oi Ben Where did we get 12 x from Vanessa We squared x minus six so we used factoring We did x minus Now do you see where we get it from Ben Okay thank you Ben What to do with the 63 what to do what to do Mason Do you just combine like subtract 63 from both sides combine all the like terms of the whole numbers and then you have a quadratic equation Okay Well now I have a quadratic trinomial and it s arranged in what What do we call that Kate Ellie Descending order Mm hm Nice so let s try and factor that Michelle you re shaking your head like no way It doesn t work Well all right then I guess we re stuck That s so stupid Don t we have to do the quadratic formula Yes if only I could remember that though It s been such a long time Sing the song You tell me the song I ll actually write the line pertinent to this problem what s the first line Keep going Plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4 a c all over 2a Okay I m going to do some of the math for you and then I m going to have you do some of the math for me because I m more interested in seeing that you can do this So I get 12 plus or minus the square root of 152 over two Now normally normally I would have you guys simplify that and give me exact answers But it s hard on a graph for you guys to see where something like 12 plus root 152 is I mean that s kind of an abstract So we re actually I m going to let you do decimals here So here s what I want to do Kevin s row through Sarah s row I want you guys to find the plus branch so you do plus You two rows find the minus As soon as you get an answer real quietly and quickly check with a neighbor and make sure we have confirmation Let s go to the nearest hundredth Okay if you ve got an answer that corresponds to what your neighbor got regroup Regroup Ellie If you ve got the same answer as your neighbor raise your hand right now over here So Melissa what was the value of x you got 12 2 12 2 what is it to the nearest hundredth Oh 12 16 12 16 All right that sounds about right And then over here my branch with the negative sine in there Ellie Negative 0 16 Okay now let s not lose sight of big picture here Context what the heck s going on Why have we been trying to chase down x and why are we getting two different answers And which one is right and which one s extraneous Help me make sense of all this now that the procedure is done Michelle Neither of them are extraneous because the circle hits the x axis at two points So what are my two x intercepts 12 16 and negative 16 In ordered pair form 12 16 zero and negative 16 zero There s that one right there makes sense And then the 12 16 zero hopefully you have room on your paper I don t have room on the board for that Should be somewhere over here It s a good pit stop moment right here Pull off to the side of the road Stop for a second are you sure this makes sense to you 
 Do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge Put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt Do I get a lot now You get what You can t do anything down here You need to help him roll that out He s going to need help right there You can put one in one side and then pull it down through there One right there When in doubt put a button If you re wondering if it should be in there it should be We re a little far apart right here You definitely need to put one right here So it s under Reach down right here and put one in This back end going to um Wrinkle Before you put a nail there Can I nail the top part of this Yes absolutely Because if I Your feet need to be on a button regardless on which side you re on you need to be on the button Please nail that one right behind you This sun coming out like this makes this felt Hot Hot and soft and it ll tear easily Now this is 30 pound felt it s not 15 pound felt So it s a lot thicker than what you got two common kinds you re going to be putting on Okay Okay how are we doing over here If you lay it up there the top won t fly down That s right That s good Communicate Communicate with each other right there Did that work out work for you Yeah Stand this way How many rinds do we need You got your left rind Now we need our interval going up to the roof Tell us what it is What you need to do on a three tab How far what is our interval here Remember Can you remember What is it Speak up Five Five Five inches okay Don t be scared You know it You shout it right out Five inches Five inches up Every five inches Be sure to measure from the top of the seam Don t measure from here It s got to be from right here Measure up five 10 15 20 Just go ahead and mark it up you re roof Get your layout there and your layout there Double check each other Check behind each other If the layout s not right and we have to tear shingles back off are those shingles any good No What No sir They re not any good Let s make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct Remember Team work just like on the job Anybody can make a mistake You have a couple of eyes on it Checking behind that s a lot better You can mark on this side It s not going to hurt a thing You can put a bigger mark on there so you can see it Alright Something like that Okay You can see that That s not small and tiny That s big Look at the difference right here Enrique My marks and your marks right here You can especially I mean this is relatively new felt This felt gets marked up and scratched up If you put a large crow foot mark on here you re going to know exactly where to hold that thing Make sure that you get it where you can see it We re going to cover this stuff right back up Now watch this felt as I pull this up and down See those bubbles in it Right here I got the bubbles at the top that means I gotta pull it down to get those out You want this stuff laying flat If it doesn t it ll probably show up underneath the machinery If I pull it down too far it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom So you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it I ve got them out and I m just a little bit below my line right here but that s okay It s more important that this is out right here that it s on Does that make sense Yeah So just make sure Now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here Don t forget our nailing pattern that we discussed Here here here here and here You can feel right here where the plywood is You want to put a button right here and your nail line is going to be right in here on this You don t want to nail into the fascia board You want to come right across in here and put them every six inches And about every two feet right here and one occasionally Be careful not to step on the felt Step on the buttons so you don t end up sliding Just be careful anytime that you re stepping on felt You never want to step on loose felt Okay All right Go ahead and nail that off This one right here See how you re doing this shingle Yeah We re gonna come back with a starter right here turned upside down This right here is gonna have to be cut off So go ahead and just cut this off even that ll be fine right now This one over here don t nail that yet Hold on just a second Come here a minute You can do it that way That s one way that you can run it down and cut it or right here I can just take this soldier just like this and I can cut it off right here Or I can just lap it up there and nail it like it is The other soldier is coming down to right here So just come up here and cut this off Got your hook weight on you Yeah Take and cut one tab off of the shingle flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there It doesn t have to be straight right I just cut it Pardon Does it have to be straight Just eyeball it No it doesn t have to be perfectly straight just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back That ll be fine Hold it down There you go Never cut back on your handle These right here we ll be able to use for the caps on top so don t throw these away Tabs always go in on these So make sure your tab s in flush it up and nail it off Once you ve done this you need to pull a layout and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles If we re gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull Thirty 36 We re gonna pull 36 inches and we re gonna pull 30 inches Top and bottom topping your lines All right Does that make sense Yeah Okay so do that Once you nail this off do that and then run your starters You can go ahead and cut that off The inches right here you can go ahead and cut them come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute You got a hook blade Y all have it You go ahead and do that then you can do the other side right here Go ahead and get your lines snapped put them on there and mark it and pop your lines Either way You can do it either way it doesn t matter but since we re gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway Flush it up and hang it Don t pull that down If you do that s just gonna take and break that shingle off This right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building so we want our finished shingles to come right here also When you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist Go ahead and mark that at the top You need to keep them moving you gotta have it marked up there Go ahead and mark it up there and mark it right here Get these popped and then you can go ahead and get Darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y all will be ready to put these things on Put your starter on it Here Thirty and 36 It s raining buttons See that button landed right there Y all make sure that you pick these things up when you re done You should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem Once they get right here you can t nail it move down the line Hammering Talk to him what do you want him to do Put a nail right there There you go Brandon is telling you right Y all hold on a minute What does putting a nail right there do I mean you re about to put it right there It holds it center because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up It s gonna hold it right Keeps it straight So really you can start putting buttons from down there to here it s not going to affect anything Because he s got that button in From this point on we can t put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here He nails it off Right but you could nail this Go ahead and start doing that Working together as a group to get the job done is what it s all about This is not a one man job you can t roll this stuff out and do it by yourself It s not a one person job If you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there s nothing wrong with doing that What you don t want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there Watch about cutting back towards your hand like that Just be real careful There ya go Mike put your hand on that roll for him I got it That may not be enough to cap that ridge off So we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to You need a button in it now He needs help Help him right here Yes sir Where at Hold on come on the line right there Yeah come on right here Is that on right Yeah next put the felt right here As far as starting this next row you got a line on Thirty six inches You got a line on 36 inches and you ve got a line on 30 inches We want to make sure that when you start this next run that you re not breaking Let me see a shingle right here I want you to watch I ve worked on several houses the whole boxing fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house The reason for that was this right here They put their starter on like you re supposed to to allow for the throats of the shingles We have no water penetration down here But once you start this starter tabs up over to your 36 inch line if I laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off I have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt This felt will only hold for so long It s going to get down here it will rot it out and there you re gonna be So you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then give me one more shingle Then when you butt this shingle up to this one now what I have is I got my break right here in the center of the full tab and I m six inches away from it That s why our nailing pattern here is important You want to nail above every throat in the far line slightly above in a three tab shingle Four nails 1 2 3 4 Just like we discussed on the PowerPoint Above the tar line Pardon Above the tar line I can t hear you Above the tar line It can be in or slightly above Most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them Your video PowerPoint was slightly above but the main important thing here is that you have it to where If you put them in random if I put one right here or in the middle of these two I could possibly have a nail where I got a shingle breaking Or I could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that s gonna line up on top of the next one It s important to go here here here and here The purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don t take and blow it up and rip the shingle off So it melts down It ll actually seal and melt down to it All right you re doing good but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut So use a shingle to square it up or your speed square Mark your line and cut it straight down right here You can nail it on first that will be fine Or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it You see this shingle right here that s got the little slit in it That is exactly six inches is what that is So you can take this shingle right here Put your speed square up here take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off Then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that Either way there s multiple different ways to do it The main thing is don t just take this put it on the 30 inch line nail it down and don t do anything else to it until you get up there Y all do it as you go These hot days like this cool that down and it won t get it s form back It ll look bad So we want to keep it looking good All right how we doing Good Good What about right here You need to put it along the edge if you don t follow along the edge There s three buttons if you started one at the top one at the bottom What s missing One in between so let s get them in there Jake you mind getting that one Is that going to be enough to roll all this If not we ll get another roll and finish it out Just go ahead and run with what you got That ll be okay that will lay down beneath Be careful about the top edge of that felt Run that y all can stand on this Get a couple more buttons in between here we re a little far apart right here I like to see two foot Go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button Get you a couple more in the middle and then cap that off Lay it right down the center 
 What are some other indicators that tell us I m in my target heart rate range Yes By the categories on your RPE chart Okay your RPE Chart you could use that That s exactly right How about within your body What s something that your body can tell you that you re in that target heart rate range Yes young lady Um the way you breath and how you re feeling Okay good your breathing your feeling some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin to hurt and your thighs are startin to be sore All those things are physical ways that your body s sayin Hey I m doin a good job in this workout I m within my target heart rate range When we do this today I want you to kind of take a mental picture Let take a mental picture of This is how my body feels when I m in my target heart rate range Whether your lower end or higher end take a mental picture so that when you re out walking or not walking but when you re out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that you can kind of have an idea how you re feelin with those with those things and you can know whether you re close to being in your target heart rate range Now one of the last things is is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history from heart disease to high blood pressure those types of things The cardio workout that we re doin today what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you Who knows that What are some of those areas Okay Let s get you there Amy It ll help prevent heart disease high blood pressure and diabetes Okay the heart disease that s exactly right Good cardio high blood pressure it s gonna bring the blood pressure down Also diabetes Along with high blood pressure you got high cholesterol All of those areas cardio is going to positively impact those areas Okay The yes What do I need to lose weight Okay to lose weight That s a question I get a lot of time If you want to lose weight ideally you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range or about 80 however you do actually at about you do burn more cal fat calories at about 60 but you re gonna burn more calories at 80 because it s a more intense workout okay So really ideally you d want to be within your target heart rate range Typically up towards the higher end will be a little better because if you re gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end Okay Any other questions on anything All right we re gonna get started here You ve already got your target heart rates there I want you to look here and I want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is What is your zone And we ll notice this most of you you know we ve all figured it out You ll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand or where most of you are gonna be in the chart We start all the way down at 100 go all the way up to above 176 You ll start to see that that most likely that 151 to 175 that s gonna be our biggest area here that we re gonna fall into You can see right there we re at 75 So most of you in here where s our target heart rate range In between Between 151 and 175 There you go between 151 and 175 That is right on the money for young adults your age If you re at that 176 or higher that s not a problem but that is an area where you know anything over about 185 or so then it just means that you ve got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people So most people though again are gonna be in that 151 to 175 That s a good job Okay go ahead and go to your machines here Lay your clip boards off to the side If you want to listen to your ipod or to your music you can only one ear phone though only one ear piece Make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there we ll do something with those a little bit later And where we re gonna start with here is we re gonna start together We re gonna start with a two minute workout On this workout two minute warm up All we re gonna do is get warmed up You need to be out on the bike somewhere around 40 rpms Ellipticals about the same thing 35 to 40 rpms On the treadmills around three speed will be a good good place to start with Is everybody good we ready to go Yes Are we good back there You all set Okay all right here we go Startin on two minutes And start All right so make sure that we got those magnets on there Bump that up to about three or so Just to get warmed up This is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit Now at the end of this warm up we re gonna check where your heart rate is we re gonna check that and you ll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to compared to you know what it was for a resting heart rate You most likely will not be though in your target heart rate zone right here after this warm up About halfway through Good job Anytime you work folks you should always do a warm up Now we ve already stretched and done some a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here So you ve got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up Don t jump right in to it You re gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk for you Good job everybody doin good Yes As we do this I m gonna come along and ask you where you are on your RPE chart periodically Cause I want to know how your body s feeling Just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are Okay Let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Real quick put your hands on the sensors let s get that heart rate checked As soon as you get that heart rate check go ahead and stop your machine hop off and we re gonna record that under heart rate one real quick under the warm up Okay stop your machine there Record that heart rate As soon as we get this go ahead lay those back off to the side we re gonna hop back over here and we re gonna start goin through the workout Now the workout s gonna be 10 minutes Again bikes you outta be pumpin out about 80 to 85 of your RPMs there Ellipticals probably somewhere between 70 and 75 We really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you re within that target heart rate zone Anybody right now in their target heart rate zone No No A little bit elevated from the resting though Yes Okay all right Let s go ahead and start At the five minute mark we will check it again and we will check that heart rate what your heart rate is We won t get off the machines again until the work out s over Caroline Now again on your own once we get into this a couple minutes on your own if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors you re more than welcome to do that You just don t want to do it the whole time you re working out and that ll kind of give you an idea where you re standing If you need if you re below your lower end of that target heart rate go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit if that s the case as we continue on through this Are you all doin good Where are we on the chart At 3 That s good You all could do this for an hour huh There you go How you doin over there Where are you on your chart Two That s good Three Three Two I d say around two Two Two Ladies how we doin over here How you feelin on your chart Three Three Yeah You good Russell Yeah Okay Andy how you feelin Where are you on your chart About four How do you feel good Where are you on your chart Doin good Most of you you re all about a two three four range right now Now we re just getting to the start of the work out but here in a few minutes that s probably gonna change Might be changing right now Probably startin to feel a little bit of fatigue breathing s becoming a little bit more difficult We re gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes Again remember I want you mental picture in your mind How is my body feeling when I m in that target heart rate range Doing a good job good job Okay we got one more minute and we re gonna get a heart rate check here If you re feelin like your in that 4 to 6 range you might be able to go ahead and up your up your intensity just a little bit there up your speed maybe up your resistance a little bit Russell did you forget to put your phone on vibrate Yeah That s all right buddy Just don t mess with it while you re on the bike okay I mean while you re on the treadmill Okay Okay hard to do hard to do anything with a phone while you re running All right let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Get a quick check Remember what this number is This is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart We want to be within that range now If you re not we need to up your resistance If you re at the lower end I want to try to get on up towards the higher end about that 80 mark So if that s the case bump your speed a little bit up your resistance if you need to We re gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes About 65 I m in my range Nice nice Where are you on your RPE chart Uh about four About four Four or five Hey anytime you know if you re saying God I just can t get my heart rate up there if you re on the treadmill increase that elevation a little bit Elliptical if you increase the resistance then you ll start to feel it How s Callie back here She s startin to get it right now aren t ya How are you all on your chart Five or six Where are you all on your chart Five Five Six Where are you guys on your chart probably around four Ladies how we doin Where are you on your chart About six Six Yes How are you Russell Six seven How about you Six Six Dale where are you Three four Three four You need to increase your resistance I mean your elevation a little bit How about you Four Four Most of you are comin up on that chart Comin up Okay we re gettin ready to do another check here Good A couple more minutes here Everybody doing okay Yup Are you startin to feel some of the signs we talked about fatigue in the legs Yes I know it s hard to talk right now A little more difficult breathing Startin to feel it a little bit more now aren t you yeah a little bit How s it going back here My legs are like rubber So now you know you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same RPMs One mile Kyle Okay in thirty seconds here we re gonna get a heart rate check Then we re going into the cool down You really push it right here You re about to jump off the elliptical aren t you Good Okay let s get a heart rate check here Heart rate check Grab those sensors Remember this number When you get this number when you ve got this go ahead and bring your speed on down We re goin into the cool down phase Make sure you remember what that number was What was your heart rate Uh 170 I m about 169 In your cool down phase now There you go good good Did we get in there in your range in your range Everybody in your range Great good job Did you stay in heart rate range Good Now did anybody on that RPE chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine Yes You did Yes Up there All right Did ya ll get in your range Yup Did you get within your range Was ya ll on your upper end or towards the lower end Upper end Tried to go up How about you guys Did you get in your range there Yeah Yeah Now here in about 45 more seconds we re gonna get our last check here on the cool down You ll notice how quickly as you do this you ll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout and even after this two minute cool down here the difference between where that heart rate drops to Are ya ll okay Okay let s go ahead and get that last heart rate check 
 We started testing out our theory that it s an exponential Cause we found out that the ratios Does that verify that it s an exponential equation We thought it did but it doesn t So why aren t you sure I don t know So the more disks I add I m eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that I can make Isn t that a logistic function So logistic function would say that you re gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make And it would say at some point you re gonna slow down the number of moves you re adding on Does that make sense based on what you ve done so far No not at all What do you think is gonna happen instead That it would increase And what would that be That s the exponential But the numbers are all really long decimals So I heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this So have you looked at your scatter plot Yes Okay What might be other ways to change an exponential function I can get it out of my backpack Based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio Before you did any of the arithmetic what did you think your ratio might be Small I don t know I didn t really think it was two automatically But two s in your head Why is two in your head Because doubling Because there s doubling Here s what I m gonna suggest to you guys You ve got your scatter plot on Marissa s calculator right You re thinking that two might have been the ratio Why don t you graph two y equals two to the X and compare it to what s happening on your scatter plot and see if there s a different way that you might be able to change the extremum It s increasing by a factor of 2 She s trying it in an actual game Normally I d want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds We re at 20 so what s your goal 27 28 29 30 31 Good job Caitlyn Good job Now I m convinced that that works You re seeing that the difference is doubling each time correct What kind of function is that suggesting Exponential And what do you suspect is probably your factor Two Two So that s what I want you to look at How could you verify that it s an exponential function using any of the tools you have here Once you ve found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is There is a little bit of a trick to this one It has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions Okay Figure out that When you get stuck again let me know and I ll be back So you think that s two to the power of X minus one Why did you get minus one Because with one it worked fine but with two when you try to put in X as the exponent two to the X so two times two is four So far X minus 1 is the exponent What I m hearing is that you re convinced that the factor is two And you re trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here is that correct Talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you re adding the one at the end Because there has to be at least one move We added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first Oh wait that doesn t work though If you have one so two to the zero is 1 And one plus one is two but that s Tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end You said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one Is it a piece of the function That would be really mean We were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end I think you guys are in a great place I think you ve got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table So try more with the transformation I also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move but I would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves that s just that you need at least one move Alright I m going to leave you guys to think I ll come back So we found the equation but now we re stuck at number four Okay so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it The difference between I was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference so how it would relate to the y values We saw the two to the x we figured oh well two to the four to the 16 Well how do we get to 15 minus one This is going back to the algebra from last year So you saw that you had two to the x You noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra You also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot Did it lie directly on your scatter plot No So what do you mean by it matched up It was close It was the same curve So how did you know that created a transformation Because whether it depends on the number or which value it is It changed the steepness of it So we just knew it transformed it somehow Like we had to have it It wasn t the parent function So what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x How did you know that Because if you d done four times two to the x you would have stretched it Because it would have moved to the left too on the graph And what did that end up doing to your y intercept Okay so that would be my next question for you I agree with you guys that definitely there s a transformation I agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables you ve done a nice job with that So how does a transformation what you ve done is you ve taken two to the x what does the minus one do Does that move this to the left Move it up or down Well if you graph it It moves it up Okay So Jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function And you re saying that you don t think the slope changes Okay so you change the y intercept And do you have a change in the y intercept It s still zero comma zero So you just had two to the x Find out just two to the x What s the y intercept of the graph What happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that The y intercept moved down And does that match what we ve been talking about You take the function and subtract the value and move down one Alright you guys said you were stuck on number four Yeah Okay Why are you stuck So we figured out that you put But the minus one doesn t do anything Yeah the numbers are so big that it doesn t matter It actually does change the actual number a little teeny tiny bit But our calculator can t see that number It looks like the same number on your calculator So we have a number of moves If each move is a second then how long is it gonna take for the world to end Alright now you guys are also at the challenge question down here Which is based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved Why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made Okay And I ll be back in a little bit I m going to give you guys about seven more minutes You should answer question four before you try that So I got it kind of close Looking at just I did what you do to find a normal exponential equation I plugged in y two over y one and then to the square root of four And are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours No You guys are correct that this is exponential But if we re not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation is on the right track So I really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values Okay I m gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group Try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have Alright what have you guys got Our answer was 30 Talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works I realized that the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one So you just have that in your head Did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head We didn t graph it We used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one Went to the table and it was the same numbers And I noticed here you ve got 2 to the 64th minus one What s that for That s from another number It s like a really high number One point eight times Two to the 19th While you guys figure out how long it s gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number I d also like you to think about the answer to the challenge You guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved So I d like you to think about why your function has two to the x Why are you doubling those 
 You each have your own set And I m going to ask you to put them out in front of you in in so you can see all the words Can we put them in two rows One Two three four five six Let s put them in two rows One two three four five six Now I wanna play Wait a minute show me I m going to ask you to point So get your pointer finger in show me under Yes under good Take a look at the word under good Wait keep it there Show me now be careful We want to get all the letters Show me there Listen to the word good Jessica There That s Okay he s gotta look He s gonna do it Very good Put it down Good Ready Alright Be careful with this one listen to my words Ready Show me Saw Good Excellent alright Show me ready They alright Excellent Alright Show me was Wow That s good Show me want Alright now You did a great job Now we re going to hide your words so turn your cards over all by yourself Now you can t see them right Keep them in the rows Good Alright keep them in a row Alright now oh your going to do it that way Okay wait a minute now Now we re going to take turns Let s see who s sitting nicely Alright You re going to turn over a card Lewis and tell me what the word is Put it down Want I want my toys I want my toys yes good You turn over a card Oh what s your word Under I see the cat under the bed alright Lewis turn over another card under oh you got under as well what s your sentence I am hiding under the bed I am hiding under the bed that s a good one Under the table Let s see Jessica go ahead do another one Now think look at your letters was Yes I was eating I was eating Good Look at your letters let them help you Don t help They There There yes There is my toy in the bed There is my toy in the bed Okay alright how about you Jess Oh what do you have There Good can you use it There is a car in my mail There is a car in your mail Wow That would be interesting Alright Lewis your turn Now look at your letters let them help you They Yes They was a cat in my car Okay this there was a cat in my car They tried to get the cat out of the car Okay They belongs means people They Okay Let s see what you have Oh look at you Today is the day Aaah this word is they The children that would be they Let s take a look at this word this is one we are misunderstanding They Jessica and Lewis they came to the reading group Okay They had turkey for Thanksgiving They have alright They came to my birthday They came to my birthday Can you think of a sentence for they They What did your brothers do They play basketball There you go they play basketball there you go that s better Okay You have another card to turn over But it s my turn I got mixed up I got Lakers socks You got what Nothing Say that again What did you say about the I got socks No this is saw This is I saw you when I I saw a movie I saw a big alligator I saw a big alligator I saw a dinosaur I saw a dinosaur Last one was was Okay Where was my friend Where was my friend good I want candy I want candy Okay Now watch what I m going to do I m going to put the cards together I m going to mix them up and I m going to turn them over We re going to play our matching game okay Alright What happened My brother put gum in there and when I point I can t get out of there Oh boy alright now Jessica you went first before right So we have Lewis go first this time Would that be fair Yes Alright Lewis you re going to turn over a card you re going now listen to me Listen to me This is how we re going to play You re going to turn over a card and you re going to read it Then you re going to turn over another card then you re going to read it Wait a minute wait a minute If look at me sweetie If you get a match you want to keep the pair You have to put the word in a sentence Can you do that Let s see Go ahead Okay take a look Take a look take a look Shh don t tell him don t tell him Was This word is was Let s see okay now pay attention Jessica so you can remember where they are Your turn Pick another card Lewis Oh it s so close What word is this Saw saw Okay Here is was Turn it over turn it over And here s saw Good Okay Jessica s turn Want Good want She read it They Not a match Good wait a minute wait a minute wait before you do that Wait before you do that They want They want candy Okay watch Lewis Who remembers what was this one What was this one No peeking Do you remember what it was Jessica Was Was good What was this one Saw What was this one They and what was this one Want Good alright They No its not they Careful take another close look Look at the whole word There Now sorry about that Good good They Is it a match is that a match No but we ve seen that word What s this word They Go to your chair now and sit Okay There and they I m going to hide them again Now let s see if Jessica remembers They and they Okay now stop You want to use it in a sentence Let s see how we do They have a dog They have a dog Good job Alright you get that one Okay Lewis let s see how you do Go ahead You can do it Oh What s that word Under Under Pick another one under No way Alright Under Okay let s see a nice sentence I m going to listen for a good one I am under my brother can t find me because I m under the table Your brother can t find you because you re under the table Can you give me a sentence for under Um I hide under the bed I hide under the bed excellent okay Now it s Jessi Oh Want Do you remember where it was Jessica Wow Now wait a minute let s see if you can think of a sentence Jessica first I want a cake I want a cake What would you want I want a brownie I want a ice cream Okay Okay alright try another one Oh Is that match No No what s this word Lewis They Come back over here and take a good look at it This word is saw Jessica s going to get it Now wait a minute maybe not maybe not saw uh eh eh ah uh was Was okay Yeah but that s okay those two we mixed up Let s take a good close look at them Which one is was Which one is saw Okay alright now listen to your first sound I m going to hide them again Let s see if we can remember Go ahead Lewis Your turn Was and which one Was There you go was Give me a sentence for was I was in my bed I was in my bed Let s hear Jessica s sentence for was I was I was in the bus I was in the bus alright Let s see pick another one Take a look at the first letter Saw Okay and what s that one saw Okay now a sentence for saw Wait a minute before you count your card A sentence for saw I saw something you see oh I saw a saw a candy You saw a candy where was the candy On the floor I saw candy on the floor Did your little brother dump it on the floor Okay I would eat it You have the last one They It s not they I want you to think again Look at all the letters Don t tell him don t tell him There Okay give me a sentence wait a minute give me a sentence with it There was a huge table There was a huge table where In my kitchen There was a huge table in my kitchen before you count your cards can you give me a sentence with the word there There is a snowman at the window There is a snowman on the window what a great sentence How many cards do you have one two three four five six seven I got six Alright we re going to do one more thing with these words to practice We have a word that we are having trouble with We re going to come over here Over to the board We re going to take a look at this word that we re having trouble with Thank you for getting her a marker I m going to ask you to write this word on the board Oh a line you know what she s telling you right Okay let s take a look at this word Are you ready This word is Jess that s good Alright This word is saw Let s see if we can write it Saw Jessica I want you to write saw Look at the word There it is Saw Okay 
 Well let s say about like a plane A plane can use the wing to like slice right through the the wind making it just fly with ease but let s say the wing was vertical and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall Okay did everybody hear what he said No Daniel did you understand what Jonathan was saying Yeah Okay so does that make sense to you then Daniel Yeah Okay John About the thing the last part did he say vertical Yeah like like like vertical like pointing upwards Oh Okay What do you think Reese what do you think Um what Jonathan said Jonathan would you kind of say it again Reese would really like to pay attention and he d like to hear Yeah I m saying like like a wing it uses like like like a V shape of a duck of a duck squad Like every single wing goes down each part and then it s just like a V Okay Shayla Um I said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn t fall onto the ground Okay Kelsey Um I think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then I think it would just float in space because there s no gravity Okay we re kind of yeah Ramaji Okay I m kind of lost Ramaji is lost let s help her find herself No that s a good thing Because I ll be honest I m a little lost So tell me where you are Like I thought we were supposed to put like why we think they were built not how they were built like like I wrote um I think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help and new aerospace technology helps build modern things Okay Can everybody understand where Ramaji went with her answers Kelsey I m totally lost now Okay here s what happened okay so let me see if we can find this a different direction Um in reading all your different sentences most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying okay or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air okay and so we re not kind of getting where I want to get to So can I for a second kind of change the discussion Just because Yes John Is it like when you take a rocket like on the rocket it has uh two wings and like one tail Great so his question that he asked does a rocket have two wings and a tail Um here s what s happening Mm I thought the vehicles would help you and what I m seeing is having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made And I m not as concerned about how this vehicle is made okay as I am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way does that make sense Yes Okay so can we go a different way with me for a minute Each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table correct Okay I know I took yours Reese which is why you don t have one now I need to know something okay This vehicle doesn t have an engine okay Okay Now I want you to think about this for a minute and I want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group I want to know how does this hot air balloon fly how does it get in the air and how does it stay in the air And is it possible you don t know anything about this Possibly Possibly It is possible okay it is possible Joelle you don t know anything about this okay So I want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies okay And I m gonna come around and talk to different groups okay So how does this hot air balloon fly Okay so you two start the discussion at this table So discuss that because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don t okay So share in your group Okay what do you two know Okay Has an engine a propulsion engine Okay but is that an engine Okay so now you can do your discussion What did you come up with over here So the fire blows hot air into the balloon Okay without it it would do what It would fall down okay Okay So any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise What do you think Okay okay Ooh that was awesome You are so good today Um I think we re now getting somewhere So let s talk about this hot air balloon for a minute okay So I ve heard some different things around the classroom I want to know how does that balloon get into the air Nathan The fire in the hot air balloon blows the the balloon up to where it can float down Okay Shayla do you agree or disagree I agree with that because yeah because you pull on a cord and like it lights up the fire and stuff and then the fire pulls in air and it like shoots it up with the fire So is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon No air is What kind of air Hot air Hot air is being shot up into this part Okay John Didn t they say one of those like if you compare They can t Jonathan can t hear you Oh sorry If you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon they re you use hot air for the air balloon and you use the helium for a small balloon yeah and the it s not really air kind of I thought it was steam Okay okay Now why would you think it was steam Because you know how when you just um when you put like a fire fire in one place it sometimes can turn into steam Maybe The fire turns into steam No not the fire but like when it s when it s done Ann Maria says she thinks you need the word water Yeah because when you heat up water then steam comes up out of it Because steam is like moisture Steam is like moisture that s In the air In the air okay Ramaji I agree with you John Okay I think what he s saying is because in air and the fire is there or whatever and so then when they re getting pushed up that comes and like then I m lost here Okay like then the steam like yeah you were right about the moisture part but it but there is no way that like water is in this There isn t water in there Yeah I mean Reese be supportive I mean there s moisture in the air but still like fire is a big part of it Okay can I ask a question Okay Do I need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly No no you don t Ramaji says no Laura says no I said no Mariah says no Kelsey I m totally lost Kelsey it s okay to be lost okay Kelsey you re if you re lost you need to know where you are So here s the question what do you feel like you know and understand about what s been discussed so far I thought I was understanding everything until John said I m so confused right now So tell me John was talking about steam John was talking about steam I would agree Kevin John was talking about steam So the question is prior to that Kelsey okay prior to that what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies Basically nothing before that I just think it s steam because of like hot and air because or like there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy Okay let s see if I can bring around some concepts Ramaji and John can you let me have two seconds okay Um we have a concept of this fire that s heating air but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam Correct But I m also hearing and I just want to make sure I understand I m hearing that the steam isn t necessary for the balloon to go up John Well this is this is how I thought it was steam Because you know how sometimes there s clouds and you you want to go up in the air balloon and sometimes it might rain like when you re in the air balloon sometimes it like when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot it actually turns into steam I think Okay Ramaji Okay Listen I ve got to come over here Okay so like like You two can put your hand down for a minute and I ll go to you next So like steam is I think it s putting pressure like on the balloon to like make it go up So we feel like we have air pressure okay I don t agree with Ramaji though because with the air there s no steam involved there s like kinda like what John said he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it Okay I m gonna ask Oops I didn t let you speak Well like it s just like like comparing this to a regular balloon with helium it would float up just like an air balloon but you can t put helium in an air balloon Does everybody understand that So if I put okay that is an awesome analogy So everybody listen If I put helium helium is a A gas A gas okay helium is a gas so if I take a regular rubber balloon and I put helium in it the helium because it s a gas helium floats that makes my balloon float right Whereas if I just blow up a balloon what happens It just falls down on the ground and I got nothing okay On the flip side Kevin what she s saying is with a hot air balloon instead of filling it with helium I m filling it with hot air okay Now I have a question I think you ve got to think really deep about this one If hot air Reese is what makes my hot air balloon go up okay I want to know would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day Just think about it for a second just think Would it be easier for my hot air balloon do you think to fly on a hot day or a cold day What about on a windy day Ooh Okay she said what about on a windy day Let s assume that there s a slight breeze on either day okay but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold okay Kelsey I personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher So I d get radiation into the balloon Okay Ramaji I think a cold day And why on a cold day Because like there s not I mean even on hot days there s still like low humidity sometimes and so like it you basically with fire would kind of I don t know not set your hair on fire but like No when it s cold there s no moisture in the air so like it would be like like helium but like Okay Shayla I think that it s a hot day One of the reasons is because there s hot in the hot air balloon and if it was on a cold day there s a fire in the thing in the hot air balloon it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground and people could die Okay Ann Maria I think it would be better on a cold day because well I don t know if this actually really makes sense but like the hot air would be working against the cold air Exactly And like if it s on a hot day it would be like the same Just a second So Ann Maria if the cold if the warm air is in the hot air balloon and it s a cold day what would you expect to happen to the balloon Go up And why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day Because like the hot air would be pushing against the cold air faster than it would be pushing against itself Okay Over here I agree with Shayla on the hot day because like a regular air balloon just regular heat would make it go up but if you had the sun hitting against it I think it would help with radiation like the sun would help out The fire Yeah how it has something to do with radiation Okay I think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher Okay Nathan I think on a cold day because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air that might pop it Awesome Kevin what do you think I think the same hot air because I ve never seen a hot air balloon fly when it s cold Okay Dakota Oh wait Kevin I have a question for you How do you define a cold day Okay what s the okay here s my question okay You said you d never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day and what I m asking is is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold Winter Winter okay Dakota what do you think Uh I think uh Kevin Dakota can think on his own I know he can I don t know Cold day warm day what do you think I think a warm day because it would be easier to fly Okay Daniel what do you think Cold day warm day I would say a cold day because the hot air would meet the cold air so it would be more enhanced going up you d get more from the hot air Okay I need to kind of bring this to a close real quick and I know you two have lots to say Tyree did you want to add the last comment Yeah Uh I think the hot day because who would go out on a cold day when the higher you get the colder it gets Okay Tyree says who would go out on a cold day because the higher you get the colder you get so Tyree s logic here is that if I m going to go in a hot air balloon I don t want to get really really cold Okay ladies I know you have lots to add okay but I kind of want to bring this to a close but I need to know a crucial question So everybody has to commit to this question I want you to don t do it until I tell you to Ready You re gonna hold um you re gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day and you re gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day I didn t say go yet Okay on three everybody So does everybody understand This is cold this is warm okay Ready one two three Okay Okay now hands down I have just two more questions and then we re gonna close out today s lesson okay Question number one I want to know if you ve ever heard the word 
 Stationary point Did he move Okay some of the other groups are moving their fingers around sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here so do you think your data might be a little more realistic Yeah Yeah okay so now one thing what type of formation do you guys have Good Put an adjective in front of it Extremely strong Strong A strong positive Do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same No No Okay so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones Remember that correlation coefficient R it went from positive one to negative one or zero Oh yeah What do you think yours would be close to One It d be really close to Then we ll get to that shortly guys later on Okay So you probably would have one that s a decimal 999 or really close Okay so you re trying to find your slope Yeah So what is your slope Two Two okay so over here we re gonna put And now does everyone have the exact same You do Pretty much Oh most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line Okay here s the slope So you just told me your slope is two now what am I asking you to do What is your No we re not done yet What is your It s 2 0 Read the question Okay what s the slope of the equation The slope is What did you just tell me Oh two Two Okay now what s the real world meaning of that What does that mean when you say yes those are two Okay now we can go back to that I just want to talk to you about the solution Just on your slope you said it was two That was perfect But now what s the real world meaning So the slope is the more rubber band What are you looking at So it s one and two One Why can t it So you want to put five Okay Ten over Okay so now you re telling me your slope is ten over one Okay well I m asking you what s your slope Now you re saying your slope is 10 That s what the slope is but I want the real world meaning So what were you saying For every one rubber band that drops How do you know How do you know But where are you getting I need a little more detail though It s dropping what So 10 centimeters for every One One rubber band Okay Now what s your y intercept Seven Seven Now is your y intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location What s the y intercept Because a slope isn t that directions to get somewhere else What s the y intercept I want the entire It s zero seven So can you write zero seven down please Write zero seven down And now tell me what the real When I ask you what the y intercept is yes zero seven Now what s the real world meaning subtract out of seven So what s this saying Translate that for me You re saying there s no real world meaning what s that saying So before we put any rubber bands on this already moves seven centimeters What does that mean Going into this lab did I know if the real world meaning was gonna make sense or not There s been a few groups today their y intercept has a real world meaning zero zero But did I know where your line was gonna go No But if it went straight through zero would that make sense Zero rubber band So So what s the real world meaning Well what do you think This y intercept that you had does it have a real world meaning No So yeah it doesn t have a real world meaning What slope did it Okay Once again did I know that coming in Depended on your data Good job Guys you re asking If you plug into this four times three that s 12 But yeah Three two and four I think it says three Okay So what s your equation Y equals 3x plus 12 Okay so let s talk about that No no it s one intercept the y It really doesn t play out with that algorithm It makes no absolute sense whatsoever Yeah but you find air Oh that makes sense But this What are we talking about We got one anyway but really that s it Wait one second backtrack for one second So what did you say here Five thirds What is a five thirds 5 3 Okay so what s the real world meaning Every five inches there is three rubber band Okay So now does the ball go on a rubber band So flip that around so you re saying two rubber bands the figure is going Yes Okay does that have real world meaning Does that have real world meaning Yeah Yeah Okay Now you re saying what your y intercept is can I see your graph paper for a second Yeah Okay So yeah it looks like it s around Does everybody have the same No Do you think everyone s gonna get the exact same line We didn t really have an intercept slope we just looked at We just Yeah which sounds great because you re all gonna draw that line slightly different so go with one then What does that y intercept Is that directions or is that a location It s a location isn t it So can you write the exact location Because you re only counting one What s the order of pairs here You have a pair of zero one so write that down Pair of zero ones You have a pair of zero ones Yeah What s zero represent Zero rubber bands Zero rubber bands So when zero rubber bands were attached how far did that One One inch Does that make sense to you So when there s zero rubber bands attached you figure out one inch Alright let s demonstrate that Let s see Can I see that for one sec please Okay let s go back to before we started Zero rubber bands attached what s happening Okay what s happening right now Zero rubber bands Did he already move one inch No So Does the y intercept come in No No You said Because you just told me it was five inches of three Yeah What are we discussing now The data or the equation for the Okay Now so does this y intercept make sense No Zero rubber bands are removed So does the y intercept have real world meaning No Does the slope have real world meaning Yeah Did I know your y intercept wasn t gonna have real world meaning Yes No because there s some people today that actually have real world meaning What would be a y intercept if it made sense Zero zero Zero zero Zero rubber bands equals Zero inches Zero inches What were you saying your slope was So let s discuss three The slope is three what s the real world meaning How many rubber bands would you need in your description Grabbing one rubber band does that make sense Okay now so now what anout your y intercept would be at 12 Now you gotta figure Let s discuss this right here Now I think you re thinking ahead But this line looks like it s crossing up here to Where is it crossing It s crossing at We re going up three look three six seven Yeah I was looking like around four So let s discuss this You have six That could be perfect but we know the exact way a line likes to go Let s go with Monique six What s that saying Let s go to a pair to the y intercept Zero pair zero six So what does that mean So write that down zero pair zero six for the y intercept And what s that actually mean Zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches So this was the figure Zero rubber bands attached does that make it already move six inches Does that make any sense at all So does the y intercept have real world meaning Could it still have real world meaning You were thinking ahead I think when you drew your line Because what s the only y intercept that makes sense here Zero rubber bands 81 inches But you didn t move But does that mean you can decide I want to make real world meaning and just draw my line down the zero Because what am I looking for The equation for the line of Is yours the equation for the line now Your y intercept makes sense If you knew the equation for the y intercept You plug in 81 inches for X right Did you end up with a negative You re fine You what Minus what Oh minus one I wanna discuss it If you re y intercept is What s the order of pairs Zero negative one so what s the real world meaning What s that mean What s the zero represent Okay so zero rubber bands what s your y interception At zero rubber bands how far does it go now Negative one Did he already go one or did he reach it So does that make sense Zero rubber bands and he s already traveled one Does that make any sense So does the y intercept Does that mean your y intercept just didn t end up happening Yeah When you know how to use this it works With zero rubber bands how fast are you going Zero Zero Okay does that mean your data s all wrong No that s the way your numbers work Could you slope this out instead three What s that mean Three three what Four is still Five is So three Three what Let s go and do number five Distance so what would your distance be Inches So it s like three inches is over one So that makes sense So does your slope have real world meaning Yeah Okay 
 They died because No CO2 Two snails So if add another plant in there is that going to add CO2 or is it going to take away more CO2 Takeaway you could probably try it with the lights off Why do you think that would work Umm Maybe it might give them some more CO2 Okay well why don t you write down your predictions so she said turn the lights off and see what happens So did your snail coordinate with your prediction Yeah but for long Not for long All right Haley so look at your prediction This is your setup Isaiah can you go shut the door for me Okay so number E Stay alive stay alive Not number letter E It lived Okay why do you think But is also in unstable environment I thought plants needed sunlight to live How are they still alive and then they died when when you Because there was no light It was light Tell me what you said I had no idea Wait never mind What do you think It s a miracle It s a miracle Why don t you go back to your prior knoweldge here What did we say You didn t answer some of those but what do you think Obviously something is making CO2 right Cause that started at six right If we hit carbon reset look It starts at six and six we re even If I hit play look what s happening What s happening to the CO2 level It s getting bigger Yeah why is it getting bigger Where s that CO2 coming from Who s making it The plants Okay why are they making it So they can live Okay what s that called Like what process is that when they make CO2 Photosynthesis Photosynthesis makes CO2 I guess No Isn t it cellular res per tation Ms Rutala isn t it that Respiration You know how we talked about this This is photosynthesis right Carbon dioxide plus water in the sun is going to make glucose and oxygen right For respiration they re taking that exact same glucose and that oxygen and they re making three things They re going to make energy to stay alive That s why those plants are still living They re going to make CO2 Which is why They re still living Uh huh And why there s a high number in there and they re also going to make H2O which is water Does that make sense Do you see now why those numbers are going up for CO2 Yeah Cause they re going through Photosynthesis No Cause their going through the energy CO2 Respiration Respiration is the process Do you see that Yeah All right you re welcome All right how are we doing here Good You guys are still ready to predict the second part Okay how are we doing here We just now got to the back That s okay you take your time This is good Take your time as long as you are understanding That s the whole point of this Okay so move on to this one What is a new question you have or an experiment you would want to do The snail one Well what s the snail one What s a question you have based on what you just did Are you curious about something What s a new question or a new experiment you d want to try How come well I just want to know why the snail keeps dying Okay you can put that down Why does the snail keep dying Did it die in every single situaiton though No Everyone we ve done so far You might want to think about why which situations it died in right All right let s see Put your head up All right you guys are still in this one Test tube C2 has plants and snails but resulted in an unstable environment why I thought plants and snails helped each other live Why did they die Because they didn t have that much what s it called oxygen Well when they started the test tube it was at six and six All of them start at six six right So look at test tube C2 To plants two snails The lights are Off The O2 level at the end of the experiment is 12 oh oh It s at what Zero point Zero point zero which means there is no oxygen so does that make sense as to why one of these died The snail was the one The snails died Uh huh and then the CO2 level is at 12 12 did the plants die No Why didn t they die but the snails died Because the snails gave off their CO2 Um hmm And why did that keep the plants alive Because they take in CO2 Uh huh okay But it somehow they didn t give off O2 I guess Why is that somehow Why weren t they able to give off O2 Because the lights weren t on Uh huh and why are the lights so important To produce photosynthesis Yes they need light for photosynthesis Remember this is like a recipe right You have to have all three ingredients to make photosynthesis work You have to have carbon dioxide you have to have water and you have to have sunlight You can t just have one of the three You can t have two of the three You have to have all three Do you see why that works Okay good Um hmm Okay good All right how are we doing here We re passing Let me ask you Yeah I did not She was in the bathroom I went to go blow my nose All right let s go ahead and work over here So let s go ahead and catchup ourselves here What is one new question you have or experiment you would preform So based on what you ve already done is there something you are curious about I just gave you free reign Go ahead do whatever you want Do you have any questions about anything Yeah E Stay here Yeah I ll stay here while you write it down Why do they have to close it up Close the test tubes up Okay so would you be curious about doing the experiment without closing it That s a good question What was your question Every four plants and four snails Would they survive with the lights on or off What do you think I think with the lights off because if they have four plants they will have I mean if they had it on they ll produce a lot of oxygen therefore the snails would die but if you put it off maybe they ll produce the right amount of oxygen They ll produce a lot of oxygen the snails will die Well it s kind of complicated No I want to try it out You re saying that you think that Because it s too much oxygen Too much oxygen In this one container maybe Well who would benefit from all that oxygen The snails Okay So we know the snails would stay alive cause they would have what Oxygen Okay what about the plants Do you think the plants are going to stay alive Nope Why Because they don t have carbon dioxide maybe How s the situation so far Good I think it s bad Probably it won t survive because So in the light it s okay It s balanced One s giving the other one s getting You got that all right So what do you think is going to happen at night They re going to die probably Who s going to die The snails Why do you think the snails are going to die I don t know Because it s going to be too much CO2 Too much CO2 Why is there going to be too much CO2 Because the snails can t get O2 cause there s no light Exactly Go ahead and hit play Whoa whoa Too much CO2 Did that CO2 what did you notice about it And the plants died There was no oxygen There was no oxygen but why did the plants die Plants don t need oxygen Plants need CO2 There was too much They couldn t give off It already was at the max Reached it s max Here s my question Are the snails the only ones making CO2 Who else is making CO2 The plants Do plants make CO2 at night How could you design a little experiment to test that What can you do to design an experiment right now to test that Take all the snails out Okay and what Okay let s see We want to see if plants will go through respiration at night We re looking for the CO2 only What is that A rock Okay so look at your data so far What do you notice They re producing a lot of oxygen I m following Okay so isn t that weird I thought plants made oxygen I mean they re producing a lot of carbon dioxide They are Why are they producing carbon dioxide I thought plants made oxygen Wasn t it through respiration Okay so they can t get sunlight so they re not going through Photosynthesis Photosynthesis but they are going through Respiration Respiration so remember our respiration right They don t have sunlight Does respiration need sunlight to work No it needs energy Nope it doesn t So all they need is what CO2 No what does this stand for Glucose Right so they need glucose and Oxygen Was there oxygen in there before we started No There wasn t Oh wait yes There was look It s even There was oxygen in there There was six cpms of oxygen so then it went through this process and it made energy which kept them alive it made CO2 which you saw because the CO2 levels went Up Up And it also made Water H2O Which you can t really tell It turned yellow And it s probably still inside the cells Does that make sense though Okay good All right how are we doing here Are we almost done you guys Are you getting you re understanding A little Okay well let me ask you something Do plants go through respiration Uh yes How do you know Cause they re color It change colors The plants change colors No the water To what color Dark blue A dark blue Like a darker blue What does dark blue represent Let s go back to the beginning part What does dark blue tell you Dark blue means that there s what Low dark blue means that there s low what Okay and you re telling me that respiration sorry that respiration Plants go through respiration right Uh huh So would there be a low amount of CO2 if it goes through respiration No no It will be Uh huh so should it be blue Yes no no no no It d be yellow Uh huh what kind of experiment did you do to show me that plants go through respiration Tia plants go through respiration If you cut the lights on and cut the lights off and if you cut the lights on then the water turns blue because it s giving off oxygen Cut the lights off they won t go through respiration because they They won t go through respiration No only photosynthesis because there will be no light for them Stop give me my paper Okay Tamara and Kelly O please stop And I have a question Do you want us to do for our predictions do you want us to do why or why not for both of them or just one Even if they re different Maybe one of your predictions your plants lived maybe one of your predictions the plants die Both of them lived Then you can just why do you think both of them lived All right I have a quick question Can you guys look over here for a second Okay Tya over here William over here Okay how may of you guys I want a couple people to share their predictions What helped your when you had the three plants that died right Most of you were surprised You were like Wow how did three plants die with the lights on They had oxygen they had a CO2 and they died Right so you were surprised What was your prediction What did you set up as an experiment to help them survive What did you predict Nacora give me one I put three plants and one snail Okay so she said she put three plants one snail How many of you guys did three plants and one snail Or a combination of plants and snails Okay why did you do that Why did you do a combination of plants and snails William Because the snails will produce the CO2 while the plants would produce the O2 Okay so he said the plants would produce O2 the snails would produce CO2 What s another option What if I said You know what I m gonna take all your snails Good luck keeping those plants alive Keyon If I take away all your snails and I said Haha you have no snails to keep your plants alive Should that be a problem No Okay tell me why that wouldn t be a problem Why would that not be a problem Haley Because all you have to do is put three plants in the dark Okay how is that going to help you How is putting three plants in the dark She said You can just turn off the lights How would that be helpful Because there s more CO2 Okay more CO2 Why is there more CO2 I would say you can just put them in the light and the dark cause when they re in the light they do photosynthesis and when they re in the dark they do respiration Okay she said In the dark they use photosynthesis and in the dark they do respiration Isaiah Wouldn t you just turn the lights off Okay we just said we could turn the lights completely off Here s another question Do plants go through respiration Yes No Okay hold on If you said no why are you saying no they don t go through respiration Because only animals go through respiration and plants go through photosynthesis Okay Brandon I want you to set up an experiment for me Put one plant Put one plant in your test tube and turn the lights off Just one plant in the test tube and turn the lights off How many people know what s going to happen One plant in a test tube with the lights off All right Look at that Okay are the plants alive Yes Is there more oxygen then CO2 No What is there more of CO2 How is there more CO2 in there It started at six and six Why is there more CO2 in there Respiration Because it s not doing photosynthesis Because it s not going through photosynthesis but that means that our O2 shouldn t go up Why is the CO2 going up Why is the CO2 going up Because in the dark the plants breath out CO2 Okay what is that process of them breathing out their getting rid of CO2 What is that process Kaleil you kept saying it over and over Respiration All right respiration Here s another question Do plants go through respiration in the day time No Photosynthesis What does respiration give you as an animal ATP wait ATP and I don t want to look no And oxygen no Carbon dioxide So respiration gives your carbon dioxide If you look up here look Elise respiration gives you carbon dioxide water and energy right Do plants when they re going through photosynthesis do they make energy Do you see energy in the photosynthesis equation No Okay so how do they stay alive during the day Do they die during the day and stay alive at night No Do they stay alive during the day and die at night No How do they stay alive the whole day long They use the sun s energy They use the what The sun s energy Okay and then what do they do with that glucose It just sits there cause glucose isn t energy yet They have to turn into respoiration Oh so do they go through respiration during the day Yes No They have to or they would die So they make their energy They make glucose but the glucose isn t energy Isaiah until they break it down in respiration so do plants have to go through respiration during the day and night Yes Yes do you go through respiration day and night Yes No You don t No Do you die at night every time you go to sleep That would be creepy You reproduce every time you go at night No what No you stay alive all day long You stay alive all day long Tamara Plants stay alive all day long because they go through respiration This is the key Respiration The key Nikera to getting the glucose for respiration is in Photosynthesis Photosynthesis This is what keeps everything alive but to get some of the ingredients for this you need to go through this Do you see why now we depend on each other Ah yes Okay understanding So we don t go through photosynthesis just plants do but plants go through both 
 You re not doing your job Follow the arrow Good Just a little bit Why Why do we say the wiffle Because it Because nothing in it It s holes Then is it the holes and nothing in it makes it heavy or light Light Light Good Next what do we have to do We have all our arrows down Good Exactly Okay Thank you Someone needs to hold this here I have a job for you Come hold the clip Hold this here Hold this here Come around here Come here sweetie Right here Hold this Okay now let s count Go to there and I ll help Okay Good Good boy Oh no Uh oh Put it in the basket Put it in the basket Good You have to help her count I need to hear you Should I could count 30 No No It s not far When this is 20 21 Good Is that more than the wiffle ball This one More than this Is this one more Sebastian Yes Good Good 52 Write your 52 down What s the problem What What have you done here Okay I see working on her turn She hasn t done anything Because we re not helping What Which one did you roll You don t need this You re not to this point yet First you re doing the rolling Okay You need to move to the side Now help her Okay Good Wait wait wait Oh okay Good Now it s turn Okay now You help her by holding the end No it s fine I can tell what it is You re doing a good job Someone needs to hold this end right here Hold the end right here Okay now Perfect Now we have to help her count So she can write her numbers down Okay start with the first one the wiffle ball How far is the wiffle ball Starting 10 here Is this 10 Where s the 10 Good You think that s how far it is Okay so write that down Put in wiffle ball I said I m next I said I m next I m looking now at asked about yours I think you have your numbers in the wrong spot Which went further Wiffle ball Which one Which one went far The baseball okay Because I think on our list you have them written backwards We ll fix them We ll find them with the right picture Okay let s see what the problem is The one s got to go on this side Please help her count where the baseball is Count with her 14 Is there a faster way we could ve done that By doing what By doing what Exactly by counting by 10s We could ve started here and gone 20 20 and then count from there You re right Good So who s next Steven Now what s going on here Sarah was saying something What s happening No remember you did this Together count them 20 Well let s look It does look like 3 Yes Good Write it on the board But you two can start And then you two can start You hold the Good Mark it Good Where does the ball go Put it in the basket Excellent Help the boys now You can hold the ramp It looks like it s about to fall Too late Wait wait All the things to say Now with the rubber ball Exactly This one s called the what Wiff Wiffle ball Wiffle ball What happened with the balls Hold it Let me look at yours You got yours done What happened with yours What happened with the baseball It went Which one went the farthest This one How about yours Which one of yours went the farthest Yeah the baseball Remember we talked about that The ball should be in the basket so it doesn t go under the chair counting What happened No but what happened here Someone has to hold it you re right Can you hold it Good That s better 30 This is 50 50 start again each one 51 Pablo Which one of the balls went furthest The baseball What did we talk about when we said at the beginning Which ball did we think was going to go the farthest The baseball Why did you think it was going to go furthest Because right Yes How about yours And Sarah s too Did the baseball go the farthest That far That was a hard push exactly That was a soft and that was a soft Which one was the softest Two Which one was a really soft push The wiffle ball Why Why did we say that Because the ball Just a little bit What happened when you weighed the ball When you put them in the balance The baseball get s heavier The baseball was heavier Baseball needed nine magnet weights you re right You remember It was heavy Good you re absolutely right Okay help him count to his wiffle ball Hold the end 
 Okay would the person who is currently writing please stand up Alright nice and loud What did you guys put And why Nicholas Carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict to create the perfect amount of work Okay very good John nice and loud Marie Curie Okay Discovered that radiation Okay What about you guys Alright Two claps for these neighbors Sit down Pass the board one person What would be this is an opinion question what do you think would be the result if scientists didn t communicate their findings to the community at large Go Do we need to write this down on the board Just give a bullet sentence Do we have to pick a scientist for this one To prove it Nope This is just an opinion Just give me like a one word bullet would be fine Okay Pass the board one person And would that person please stand up Troy what did you guys have There would be multiple theories on how things worked Society would be stagnant and Newton s hypothesis Newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff and he didn t think it was important So when he found out a few months before that he didn t publish it until they asked him about it and then he republished to them so they could hang out with everybody else Okay Excellent What do you guys have There would be no uniform units therefore there would be no real way to judge one s discovery and you couldn t really bounce one idea off another Okay What d you guys have We said that we wouldn t have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done Because I know that Celsius went off of Newton s ideas of how the poles were flat and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were Okay Very good Alright Two claps for all our neighbors Pass the board one person Okay I like this one If you could interview any of the scientists that we ve looked at today who would it be and what one question would you be sure to ask Okay Go Okay Stop right there Pass the board one person Please stand up Please stand up Who s going from this group Andy Super Okay Nice and loud Let s use active listening John who would you guys pick and what question would you ask Marie Curie I said it right And what question would you ask dear If she got any oppression from the male scientists Okay The oppression from the male scientists I like it What about you guys We would ask Thomas Edison What inspired you to create the phonograph Excellent Okay Back there Who would you pick and what We were also going to ask Thomas Edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs Of the light bulb specifically Okay Brandon We had Albert Einstein and our question would be how did he come up with all his theories if he couldn t pass high school math Okay What d you guys put We picked Oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this If he realized what he actually made You probably can t see it but they have written on the board The Manhattan Project Okay Very good And you guys Oppenheimer What his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb Okay This is a really great segway to what we re going to do next Big claps for all these guys Please move into your catwalk formation Find a partner Go In ten Without the boards Just yourself Just your bodies Nine Eight Seven Six Five Oh we have a partner whose hand is up Four Looks like there we go Three Two One Be sure to oh we need a real quick hands up don t we Hand ripple Establish who your partner is Wow That was emphatic Okay Be sure you re using active listening because I will quiz you Here s your question How are scientists affected by social issues Social issues going on in our culture How does that affect what scientists can and can t do or what they think The person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back Go When you re done stand back to back Okay Face me Since this one is kind of a shifting gears one I want to let you volunteer Did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave Yeah Interference from the church Okay Definitely a social issue If they don t have their research believed they could not receive funding or just get shunned basically If it disagrees with what the society basically believes in Okay So you could be shunned you could risk your political or your religious beliefs Em Problems with morality like testing on animals Okay Did you guys want to add something down there No No You re good They said what we said basically Okay This question is for the other partner Why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world Think for a few seconds Why do scientists try to understand the natural world Okay Give your answer then stand back to back Go Okay Face me I m going to let you guys volunteer on this one too Who had a partner with a really good answer Yeah It s just human nature to question things Okay Very good Since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it We just question Okay What d you guys have Because they re extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do Okay So we re very curious creatures How to make things in everyday life easier Ooooh That segways to my next question Split apart Brody take the catwalk Logan take the catwalk Hey you guys were my first ones last time too Aw such love I was the first one last time Were you Yeah Oh I just remember those two catwalking together Okay Shift us down two Super Shift down two And a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Super Okay The person who has ordered the most ID badges this year is going to answer the following question Shh Here s your question Five Four Three Two Thank you Here s your question What motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs What motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs Think about it Go Okay Split apart I m just going to randomly popcorn on this one Brandon what d you guys say We came up with make life easier Okay To make life easier Alright What s something you guys said Money and power Money and power Interesting What s something you guys said To decrease death Like medical science Okay So let people live longer Probably also live more quality lives Excellent Okay Take the catwalk Take the catwalk Shift down two partners once she gets down there Shift down two Super And a quick hands up Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Uh oh There we go Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Now everybody take three steps that way One Two Three Super Okay This time the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question What evidence can you cite from today s scientists that we ve discussed where something microscopic something you can t see was being sensed or manipulated What is an example of the scientists we learned today hold on just one sec What is an example of something the scientists we learned about today hold on hold on hold on I had a request to restate the question What is an example from the scientists we learned about today using sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can t be seen Okay Now go We certainly cannot see that Except on the macroscopic level we can see the results of it Brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster So Brandon what was your answer I found on Thomas Edison found radio waves Okay Very good Face me please Emily what s something you guys talked about Marie Curie found radiation from atoms Okay Very good Erin what s something you guys talked about Okay Very good Take the catwalk Take the catwalk On the catwalk Alright PG PG PG Thank you Scooch down And hands up Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Super Okay The person whose last digit in their address is the lowest is going to answer this question Okay Here is your question We talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world What is your opinion of scientists manipulating using for our benefit our natural world Okay Go Okay Face me Nice and loud so everyone can hear Brian what did your group discuss We thought it all depended on humanism How they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world that they feel like they re higher than all the other creatures then they can do what they want to the natural world Okay So as long as it s being used for good I guess Okay With the benefit of humans or the world in general Kind of a socialist view The world In general Okay John what did you guys say Yeah what did we say Pretty much the same thing The same thing pretty much Okay So are you specifically looking at human needs or more global Human Okay What about you guys What did you partnership talk about That it was okay to a point There was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world Like taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another Okay So who should decide what those points are I don t know Okay Alright That segways us to the next question If you were Let s see let s do this The person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question Okay If you were the scientific consultant to President Barack Obama what percentage of our National Budget should be spent on science and why Justify that amount Go It s a percentage So we re not talking a dollar amount What percentage Well it doesn t really matter Do you think half of our budget Do you think a third of our budget You think a quarter of our budget I don t know You could delineate that Okay I could tell by looking at you guys that we ve got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this so spread back apart and face me What did you guys say Well I said that 15 is a good amount because then it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need Okay Now you guys had a very specific take on it What did you guys talk about We talked about if medical if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences as well as it should and if it is then the percentage should be increased to help Like 50 to 60 if medical is included Okay So we have to look at the different kinds of research Are we just studying stuff to study stuff Are we developing a technology that will help human need Are we looking at medical Alright Very good Take the catwalk Take the catwalk On the catwalk They do their little turns on the catwalk On the catwalk Okay Of the science of the person We haven t scooted Oh scoot down I m out of order Thank you Scoot down I got so excited about the questions Scoot down Scoot down We will Okay Here we go We re creatures of habit sometimes Hands up real fast Make sure you ve got the right partner Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh There we go Okay The person whose third no The person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest 
 Okay so for social needs we said that their social needs are being met because they They look like the slave traders can talk to each other because they speak the same language but the slaves don t so their social needs with each other aren t So you feel your social needs are being met Yeah And how so Because our person can talk to Cause you have people to talk to don t you Yeah Anybody agree with that I agree because our person You I am You re that person Don t say my person cause that s you I can talk to other people So you do have some social interaction So there s some disagreement there as social needs are being met or not No hands Nita jump in We cannot So your social needs are not being met Yes our social needs are not being met because we They do not understand each other meaning like deaf Or they cannot talk So how does that make you feel Go ahead and talk about your emotional needs now being met or not being met Our emotional needs are not being met right now I think I disagree I think ours are kind of being met I agree with Lauren s Ours are being met because they re more happy that they re gonna get a lot of money You re the person But our person is kinda serious like he doesn t really want So as far as what Nita s already talked about Emotionally So are your emotional needs being met He looks angry You feel safe you re good to go Yeah cause we know we re She s like I don t really want to go but They want the money But we want money We want all the money Well it s the physical needs anyway Ours Ours are not being met Ours are being met cause we get weapons and everything all good food I agree And ours are also being met You don t want to mess with them Yeah I disagree with both of you guys because ours are not being met at all Definitely not We are like We re starving Starving My needs are not being met if I m Ashley because I m scrunched together I m uncomfortable My physical needs aren t being met because it s crowded and my muscles ache Does anyone agree with that That their physical needs are not being met I agree that Ashley s physical needs aren t being met because they are scrunched together and it looks like they re in chains and they don t have much Are your physical needs being met Yes Our physical needs are being met because I disagree with you because I think you have space Our physical needs are being met We re not like You re in good shape With your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs How do those kind of all go together Talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel based on this picture You re that person so use first person point of view and discuss how those are all intertwined And then add to your conversation as far as I know some of you did the bottom two as far as not These are what are being met and these are not being met So make sure you cover those two okay How they all intertwine or if they do And then you can discuss these bottom questions too Even if you didn t get to them with your partner jump in now with each other I ll be right back Alright so My emotional needs are being met I m earning the money that I should be and I feel confident All of our emotional needs all of our needs are being met Why are the clothes taken off and why are the Just in case Emotional needs are not they do jump overboard being met It looks like they re sad because because we look depressed And you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like Our faces and their and our body language And there was and we re scared because we see the weapons and we don t know what they re gonna do with it to us So think about the cause and effect of that Our emotional kinda was being met Are the people standing up No But how are they not chained Still all of our emotional needs are being met They re running away They don t look worried they look kind of like they re looking at the scenery kind of They look calm In their expression they look calm yeah They don t look worried or anything These people but the people that are sitting down I disagree with Alan cause they look calm and confident I kinda disagree with that because they look like That s why they re all facing different directions They re watching for anything suspicious They re all looking in different directions They aren t smiling like they re looking at beautiful scenery There s like little sections in between so like Grayson said if they do jump overboard they don t all fall over and tip the boat Do you think these people are all in one group No let me rewind and say my question again Do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had Do you understand my question I m not saying it very well Were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group Yeah You think so How were the roles different I think there s bosses and then there was slaves Like slave traders and them Kind of serious like they just got their reward and these people they look kind of like chained I don t think they re running away I think they re running away I think they re going to a bigger boat cause these people look like I think they re like That s not the full canoe And they re just taking the slaves to the big boat So let me say my question again Let me say my question again Why would slaves take slaves They re slave traders They re not slaves How do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders Let me say my question again I want you to think about your role and what was just said Do you think that all roles that I gave this group were I m sorry are on this picture No Oh you re changing your mind Discuss that At first you said yes Discuss that why maybe not all the roles that I gave you were on this picture No do not say your role yet Ladies and gentlemen we have about one minute I think that they are people in the tribe and they re giving their slaves as slaves You know how we were doing that worksheet the graphic organizer It said that most of the time they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones Well I think Cause they could still have their own slaves I think this is a slave trader well not really like a slave trader but like Cause the slave traders a slave boss kind of were from England so I think they d have white skin I think they re with the other people But remember African Americans were also slave traders Because they re not chained and they re standing and the other people like slaves are all tucked together and depressed I think that some European traders tried to persuade other slave people to say like go get your crime people go get your crime people Slaves Yeah your slaves in your own tribe and then we ll trade you Gold A bag of tobacco And those helped capture So even though they don t have white skin they might be slave traders and they give like So we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders is that what I m hearing you say One being They could have also been threatened to work Europeans Hold that thought David One being Europeans and one being African Well not really African American Cause in the book it said that the African slaves not the European slaves but the African slaves their slaves were kinda like maids So I want you to think about the role that you were given And I asked you to look at that picture from that perspective Is it possible that that specific role I gave you has many different perspectives itself Yes Alright I want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add and then we re gonna continue tomorrow You re not gonna tell Not yet no I changed my mind You think you know You think you know We still have the cards Aw rats They did it 
 Okay What objects or pictures do you see I see a flag A flag A sign The sun And the letters A sign Yeah And the birds There are birds over here People carrying bags Okay people carrying bags There s a ship A ship The ladies all have hats Okay The ladies all have hats on They look like they re dressed to go somewhere right Yeah Good All right Do you want us to write it in here You can copy it I have the words spelled up here We have Uncle Sam We have a boat Do you want us to write it I m going to have it up here Yeah Oh We have a flag We have this thing What does this thing look like Kind of like a witch No No Yeah It looks kind of like a witch Something scary anyway right Yeah Broccoli It looks like broccoli Okay Yeah it does It s kind of fluffy on top I agree All right There are people We ve got people We ve got birds Mm hmm So here are our objects Uncle Sam boat American flag I wrote scary devil looking thing If you want to put witch looking thing that s fine I m gonna put both Traveling people and birds I put enough blanks for a few objects but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote All right Okay Which of the objects whoops Okay Which of the objects do you see could be symbols The flag All right This is what I want you to do Stop Turn to the person beside you Beside you beside you beside you See if you can think of you already said flag That s a perfect example It is one of them I think four of these are symbols Not every object is going to be a symbol So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more Each pair can be that Two different Yeah Oh All right What did we come up with We came up with the top of his hat thing It s the same as the flag It looks exactly like the flag okay So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of U S Of the United States Good Did you come up with one The traveling people The traveling people What do you think they symbolize They re from other countries Yeah They symbolize people from other countries Good Did you come up with one The scary devil looking thing Okay What is that It s clouds in the sky Okay It looks like clouds but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary looking thing To get them out To scare them Or maybe it s the rain They re scared of storms Okay Who is the devil looking thing Who is he going after The people The people What are the people running away from From their other countries From their other countries So what could the cloud be a symbol of Bad things Immigrants Yeah They re the immigrants What is the cloud Yeah Their governments from their own countries Oh Is coming back after them or trying to scare them anyway All right Here we go We have these four Uncle Sam the boat the American flag and the devil looking thing I didn t do one for the travelers but you re right They can symbolize immigrants Uncle Sam symbolizes America This is one you didn t say I told you The ark this boat here symbolizes what The Bible The ark from the bible Okay Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible Yeah What did the ark do It saved It saved Noah his family and who else Animals And the animals Oh yeah Now I remember So what do you think this boat s purpose in this picture is What s the boat going to do Save them Save Okay So knowing that knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America what do you think Are these people being stopped or welcomed Welcomed Welcomed And how do we know that He s letting them in He s like come on let s go But how do we know that he s welcoming them and not telling them to stop Because it s the ark Because it says ark okay And we re connecting what we know about the ark to this picture That is called an allusion In English class you talked about allusion Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous Some famous piece of literature Okay The flag stands for freedom The scary devil looking thing is governments from other countries Take a second and copy that down Okay I ll go on to the next question How are the words How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean Okay We talked about this already The U S Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States Okay Identify the cartoon s caption All right In this cartoon there is no caption There is no title at the top or at the bottom but there are some words that help us understand and that s this sign The sign says no oppressive taxes no expensive kings no compulsory military service So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants To the traveling people Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon Okay What words or phrases here can be used to identify I was going to say the ark Yeah The Ark of Refuge And what does it identify The ark It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon What is the ark The boat But what is it a symbol of Welcoming Yeah A symbol of welcoming people right Or a symbol of America itself because once you re in you re in America What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant All right Calling the U S a refuge tells us people come here for safety We ll come back to it And here the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings Tell us why people left their countries To get good jobs Yeah To get jobs To have a better life Right What were they running away from From paying taxes From paying taxes From kings Now any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings 1900s 19th Century The 19th Century which would be the periods were very big Kings were a problem in some places in the world No oppressing taxes Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s people were dealing with this okay So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out All right List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean What adjectives are in the cartoon It s on this sign for one thing Oh The kings Okay What did they call the kings Wealthy What did they call kings What kind of kings did they have It s kind of hard to read there Okay Here we go We ll do it this way Controlling Yeah More powerful than others Expensive can t see I know I know So oppressive means it s controlling Expensive means they spend too much money Yeah Compulsory means that you have to do something Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army The army s a fantastic place but not everybody wants to be there You do understand right Yes Okay Anybody not want to be in the army I want to serve my country Yeah Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it No I want to have a choice You want to have a choice I want my army to have chosen to be there Right Because I don t want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there okay Okay Describe the action in the cartoon Action I can t cover those I forgot to put the space bar Okay so what s happening in the cartoon We ve already said this Everybody s coming to Uncle Sam And what s happening The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam Right All right What is the message of the cartoon It s that we have to welcome the immigrants Correct The message of the cartoon is that the U S is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don t like What special interest groups now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon Stop and take a second Turn to your partner See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon Talk to you partner What is it Okay A special interest group Go ahead keep talking A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them okay So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree 
 who s done writing Okay Alright Ok couple of goals for this piece today Here s where we re at here One clearly get the notes and rhythms down because this Comstock piece ok and so is the second Middleston piece three the primo So we ll do both those today wanna get the notes learned the notes and rhythms learned but I also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece just like if we were getting ready for contest in March do one of those little example pieces for sight singing So we ll treat this in the same manner as that Then I wanted to also as we re reading the piece take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it You ll see some things here in a minute Alright so if we take a look at the piece and we ve already written solf ge in We take a look at the piece what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different Repeats okay even before that like right up by the title Canon Canon what s that mean The canon okay what s a canon It s a round It s a round right so you have one set of music and then the same set of music follows it later right We do that in warm ups okay Alright so a canon So you think soprano and alto are in canon It d probably be women and men Probably women and men good good observation So we look at the structure where might that canon begin After a P at the bottom of the page okay So pick up to measure 11 alright Okay so what kind of material do the guys have there It says we mix with the women s structure Exactly that same material that the girls do So in our rehearsal noting that this is a canon at least to that point how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away Girls and guys sing their parts together Girls and guys sing their parts together good easy So if we do that then what might something else be helpful for us to do We re singing parts together maybe pair up Typically we get together and we chant so let s do that first Let s do the chanting just like we do for sight singing so you can practice that Okay so what are our pairs gonna be Soprano and tenor so you have to move and bass and alto So starting at solf ge girls you start at the beginning guys you simply start at measure pick up at measure 11 okay Go on and move Yes circle up right here Alright who s gonna be our leader Who wants to start us off Alena Alena Okay you can start us off Who s going to start the you Okay there you go Okay good go for it Chant it quickly Let s start at the beginning we are on the pick up to 4 So 1 2 3 and 4 So so mi fa so do re mi Okay so now we got to the end of that go to measure 11 for the girls and measure 21 for the guys Go right there and start it again So now girls you go measure 11 which is right where you finished and guys go to 21 Same thing here that s a little bit different Alright 1 and 2 Let s all chant together in rhythm Stay in your groups Stay in your groups please but we re gonna start with the sopranos and altos and then we ll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page So start at the beginning everybody 1 2 and ready and go Stop okay now guys you re gonna pick up there and girls you re gonna come in 2 beats later Here we go ready and go Okay go right on the coda please So we would ve done the repeat now we go back here Go right on the coda please right after the double bar ready and go 3 4 fermata cut off please Sopranos ready and go Bass Okay pretty good we ll come back to that That takes a little bit of fordating when you get together Okay go back to sections let s do right in the not your traditional sections Let s keep the basses over here altos over here tenors and sopranos over here So do two rows back in your sections Okay so we re gonna do just like we chanted we re gonna partner up and we re gonna sing it at the same time Okay at the same time So guys you re starting in measure 11 Girls you re starting in measure pick up to 1 Ready and Do do do do do Sing that first note please sopranos and altos and okay tenors and Basses okay let s sing all at the same time right where your canon first name of the canon is Here we go 1 2 and ready and sing Okay sopranos sorry altos and basses here we go Doo doo that s a mi Here we go start that again 1 and beginning and go Okay go back to the do Do mi so la Fa do la fa Sing that ready on the do 1 2 Do that again same spot 1 2 Okay good excellent reading good for you Now putting it together Canon lots of people think oh canons are easy no problem it s the same thing Except canons tend to be tricky we ll see how it goes Here we go soprano and alto first Do mi so mi do Sing your first notes girls ready and Here we go 1 2 and ready and go Okay good I was gonna stop you before then but you did so well so we kept singing Good for you Okay so what happens at 21 for the girls Well not sorry measure 11 for the girls Does what something different so what would we call it B or the counter melody of this Okay So it s kind of the same shape but it starts on what pitch class instead of do No sorry what did we first start at the beginning So and mi and this starts on do So different pitch class same shape but it s singing the fifth lower okay for soprano Okay good let me hear the guys please You did really well until we got to the B section Let me hear actually let s hear everybody do the B section So guys you re gonna start at 21 girls you re gonna start at 11 Basses it s just No it s not it s not different at all Do here is do Find your first pitch 
 Look I can be a serk Now my whole house is great I can do anything good I like my school I like anything I like my dad I like my cousins I like my aunts I like my Allisons I like my mom I like my sister I like my dad I like my hair I like my hair cuts I like my pajamas I like my stuff I like my room I like my whole house My whole house is great I can do anything good Yeah yeah yeah I can do anything good Better then anyone Okay Ok what cha learn from the video She can do anything Ok what else She likes to sing Be positive She likes to sing be positive What else What else did you learn about the video Believe in yourself Believe in yourself Okay now how is this going to be related to our yearbook class Stay positive about it People get a what s gonna what the outcome s gonna be Okay and the outcome is something that we wanna be able to serve the entire school Okay what else How is this also related to yearbook and what we re trying to accomplish We shouldn t blame ourselves I m sorry We shouldn t blame ourselves Okay good good Okay so what we re going to do after this this is a good start I think for the work that we re gonna be having to do this afternoon We re gonna have to work on our ladder And I know that we ve spent some time on it we ve had to make some considerable changes But I think that the compromise the agreement that we all talked about yesterday I think it can be implemented today So what we re gonna try to do is based on These are the signatures that we have allocated One signature for elementary school One signature for middle school And five signatures for the high school I think let s try to fit it in Let s try to stay within the seven signatures Don t forget we have ads also Okay so I think Tanisha and Dustin and Jazz will be on team one And Sammy Emily and Colleen will be on team two Let s work together What are the rules of getting the teamwork going When we re trying to discuss What are the things that I want you to think about Everyone has a voice Okay everyone has a voice What else We all have to agree to a middle ground Okay And it s not just for the high school seniors Okay so it s for the entire school The elementary school middle school and high school So let s be fair and try to get everybody involved What else Discussion wise among yourselves What would I like you to be working on Collaborative work Compromise Okay let s go ahead and start You have the books there you have copies of the previous ladder Let s get it good Yeah I understand elementary school middle school high school In what order It s up to you honey If you want to start with the middle school elementary school high school I don t know maybe just cause I m a senior I kinda like that plan It just seems weird starting at the elementary school I think it s just that they re not as important just that Cause it s always started at high school It starts with the seniors and it s like this is what for Okay now remember just because it s always done before I know but If we started with the elementary school We d be starting with the fourth grade And that s really our Kind of an awkward place to start Okay now remember with your signature you were gonna start with Student Life correct With the High School So you could start with that I mean look at it and you can see And then we re gonna start it with like the introduction Um like um Pictures Student life candid shots Right And then we re going to the seniors and all the senior stuff and our classes And then the sports and night clubs Yes We re not gonna have a class class division page anymore Cause all of the classes are scrambled Are we still thinking like doing division pages Like how it was worded originally Except not for the classes Because all the classes were split up Yeah now it makes it easier to do your me right Don t forget what s our theme Me Okay so keep that it mind when you re creating your signatures And I think now that solicited more allocated the sections are allocated Your division pages maybe more adaptable They ll fit in there more Yeah They ll fit in there more Don t ya think I guess So should we just do one like just high school division page then middle school Yes try it and see See Now you might still need a division page for sports you might still need a division page But you don t need as many I think We definitely won t have one for the classes Cause they re all split up They re already split up And I think this is what helped save us pages Remember you re getting eight signatures Um Question Yeah The yearbook two pages and ads is under the high school Only because I just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end Okay So whatever is your last section you have to have ads We have to start selling ads And again if you have any questions on the photographs Sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want Show the blood drive scales And then But their only sport is the seventh grade basketball Everything else is going into high school Does it make sense Yeah yeah They all happened right there together Are we still gonna do straight lines and single lines like they did I think we might just do a big column Yeah We can still do that and then after our seniors we can explore all the classes in line And it makes sense If you have that quote Yeah We are gonna do Student Life seniors all the senior stuff And then classes Make sure that you have your page counts Are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages I guess we could do school and then We would have to have the division pages that we thought of the spread division page with all the things It could just be different little division pages Yeah okay so Or like have the title at the top of the page Don t forget she has control of the photographs So you need to consult with her okay You can ask her Okay um So are we going to do a senior opening page I think we could just have an opening page on the division page I thought we were going to do the top Instead of doing a collage how they put in their like the song and all that on the second page Around all the photos we should put Cause in our theme or whatever it s just a strip Of pictures Blended in the big picture So we re have written around it to add in these So I think that we should put these on the first opening page Now remember we did this only because we had no choice I like well I like the happenings that we decided not to do for the opening page for the seniors Because it s new life Since our theme it s just one strip We could arrange it like this I think that we should put on that page we should put these Oh definitely Yeah good idea Well what happened is the reason why I placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally it was so empty and it didn t mean anything so we went ahead and did that I think it would have been better to do that from the beginning And then we can have Alex start doing the onward for two others Do we want to put favorites before the formal I think we should put favorites So we re talking this one right These are the formals you want before the favorites No we want our favorites before our formals Oh Okay And then we re combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right Yeah Well you know what do you think Well I like combining it Can you pull up the other ladder Do you still have that one If we have that picture and then another picture and then another This one Is this the ladder you want to see Which section do you want to pull Student life I think it s on that Right here Yeah Let me know Because then I can go back and let her know So you want to start off with that So it ll be like The formal then the baby and then the quote Can you tell Emily what she missed yesterday About the quotes No were you present When you said that a lot of seniors who didn t have quotes last year They would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off If they can come up with their own And I have a quote book Somewhere and we can start deciding We can go from very funny to very serious So the kids can have a good choice Did you want me to go back to the other one How are you deciding the order Is it just from serious to funny or Well it s more funner stuff the memories into the more serious stuff And you re ending it with the grauduation Yeah You rather repeat our homecoming But that s spirit week There s another one That s what homecoming fills This is the problem On the other ladder that we had the only high school Student Life we had was Holten Hemming and Spirit Week That s the same thing Yeah Hemming and Spirit Week Like one spread and then the awards honors Well that doesn t make up for all the signatures Oh then we had prom You had the prom and then you had how about the senior the um Sports Banquet Sports Banquet should award everybody Not just seniors Yeah it s got uh Do you want to put that under student I don t What if we You cut the prom down to one page but maybe we could put it back to two pages we could show like the planning of prom and setting it up Okay but Cause I m on the prom committee Okay so and you have your committee meeting start taking pictures Guys remember we have seven cameras So take cameras with you when you re having little meetings Just make sure you re flexible enough just in case we don t have enough pictures you can flip back to one page instead of the signature I mean instead of a spread Well I don t know how we re gonna fill up the signature then Well you don t have to have we can move everything up And then we move seniors up into another half of the signature and that half would have to be colored Because it s the senior signature Um Do you have a section for committee We had those in with the clubs With like all of their what they do in the community Okay if you want you can bring it up a little more Just the overall community that doesn t have a club And use up that space Like the blood drive The blood drive is not part of the school Rotary does that Rotary yes but that s the interact is with Rotary yes Yeah we help with that We help Rotary But you also do the Victorian Classic Yes You don t have enough space You need to put the blood drive up I mean how much space breaks A spread Oh Interact has a spread Yeah we ve covered this three times now Okay sorry Yes but we ve changed it three times So Find other community things Well if you want do you want to talk about the tax bill Well that s not really student life It s going to affect your life Yeah but 
 Three two one stop Okay were there pairs of you who chose different things Um hmm And who wants to share I said if I had to pick I would pick the green cylinder because the white would overflow easy the pink you would have to reach down far to get it Okay Devon I would pick the pink one because it s like thin enough to be like a cup and you can do this with it And it would be a lot easier than just like doing this especially because if it gets on the bottom of the green one it would be hard to get it and the white one it might spill if you walk around with it Or you could trip Okay good Layla But well I agreed with Devon on the pink one but I would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn but it also is harder to hold unless you were to like since it has more area the white one has more area than the pink or the green one More area you re talking this way Yeah Okay so you re saying You take the popcorn and you could like you could make it even on the bottom of it so it wouldn t necessarily be overflowing unless you were when you walk for the popcorn thing Okay all right Brittany Me and Lani had the same answer we would think that it sort of relates to what Devon said if we picked the green one because and related to The pink one s gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn And the green one is wide enough and it can hold it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one But it s still gonna be hard to get down the pink one and the white one s just gonna spill Okay all right Tiffany We thought that the green and pink one it doesn t matter because they re probably gonna hold the same capacity since they re the same shape it s just one s taller and one s shorter but the short one s wider and the tall one s skinnier it s tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same So you said either one of these two It didn t matter okay Kylie I would want the green cup because it s easier like to get your hand down it The pink one looks like really skinny so if you have big hands it would be hard to get your hand down it Okay all right Amani I think the green one becuase when you look at it the old popcorn container and the green one they re kinda the same although the green one is a little bit bigger so then you could get more Okay I said the green one also because the pink one is skinny and it if went to the same size as that with the same amount of popcorn it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one Do you know what I m saying Say that again Okay I picked the green one because say you fill them with popcorn and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one and you put it in the green one it s gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one And the white one it s just gonna fall over cause it s too small it s too flat Okay hold on Josh Now Tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount Did you say that Mm hmm And why did you say that Because they re the same size paper except one they re just folded different Okay she said that because they re the same size paper they re folded differently but she thinks that they re gonna hold the same amount And you are disagreeing Mm hmm Okay she s disagreeing saying that the green one s going to hold more is that correct What you said I said yeah the green one would hold more Okay Josh what do you think I said I would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out and because it might have more volume than those two Yeah Okay so let s change our thinking here Some of you did think about which one is going to hold more It didn t matter whether your hand could get easier into this one or Devon liked this one cause he could tilt it up he didn t even have to have his hand in it at all which is an interesting way to look at it A lot of you said you didn t like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot Yes ma am But unless you did what I suggested and you like evened it out on the bottom Yes because you said you liked this one cause you thought it held more than the other two But you d have to like flat not necessarily like squish the popcorn so it s flat you d have to like shake things sideways so that it would even it out Like food in a pan you would shake it to even it out on the bottom Okay all right Well it s kinda like with the little kid packs there are things shaped like that and it has like gummies and popcorn in it and I don t like it cause like everyone would get the other ones it would have like more popcorn in it Okay Tiffany What I would suggest the white one is like even it s the same shape as the other two pieces of paper but it s folded so it s taking less up space but it s folded Because it overlaps here it does overlap here with the white you re right there But I disagree with Molly because the popcorn amount that s inside of the inside the square ones at Newtown is the same amount as one of the plastic ones The exact same amount of popcorn cause they actually use those as measuring cups I ve watched them do it And I ve watched them actually use those cups those hard ones to fill the other cup to fill the other ones So you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this All of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones as measuring cups All right Devon I agree with Layla like they re all the same I think it just depends on like who you are kind of like which one you want Okay but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one Yeah So if you could choose that would be a good thing Right hold on a second let s move on a second and I m gonna have MK come up here and help me We re gonna see if they hold the same okay I want you however on your paper to write down you know which one you think holds the most do they hold the same or if you think they hold a different amount put em in order like which one is least middle greatest why don t you do that real quick Why don t you put em in order which one do you think Okay this is what she thinks she thinks least middle greatest Here s what we re going to do I do not have popcorn but I do have cereal And hopefully hopefully MK can pour this Hopefully okay so you re I m gonna hold it Or would you rather hold it and me pour Wait yeah you might wanna pour it Okay and just make sure that the bottom stays Okay We are smellin the sugar up here Yeah Okay can you all see that it s at the top Yeah All right Now what we are going to do so this is this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls We re gonna put this over top and you re gonna lift it up and see what happens And some of you have predicted that it s going to be the same right How many have predicted that they re all the same All the same Okay How many are predicting that the green is bigger Predicting that the green is bigger Okay What about the white is biggest Anybody predict the white is biggest Okay why don t you lift this up I ll hold this this time You gotta make sure that Pink s bigger Ooh Can you see Can you see So there s more room right There s more room in the green one Why Because the more space it has the bigger around it is the more cereal that could fit in it So what is that called around here Circumference Well this is circumference but at the bottom Volume It is volume cause we re measuring volume But what is at the bottom of this Base A base is that what you re saying That the base it depends on how big the base is Well let s look to see whether it ll fit in here Okay There it is Exact same room as the pink Well do you think there s the exact same room as the pink No I think the white has more You think the white could fit more Yeah Okay thank you MK have a seat But what do we know about this one now It s the smallest It s the smallest Do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here and figure out what the formula or the volume is Like the length of it the length of the pink one Does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures Eight by Is it eight by 12 Eight by 12 eight by six Eight by 10 Eight by 10 Eight by 10 A foot A foot Eight by 11 Okay it is actually eight and a half by 11 okay Eight and a half by 11 So our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11 Okay So for our pink one What is when we do this What is this The circumference Its the circumference What do we know about the circumference then for the pink one That it s 8 5 It is 8 5 So circumference equals what 8 5 The circumference equals 8 5 Are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference Yes No You say yes Yeah I know what you could do you could divide it by 3 14 cause that s how you get cause you know how it s the opposite of times so that you would do it and you would divide that by 8 4 no 3 14 and then you ll have the diameter and then you can just take half of that and that d be the radius Okay all right tell me Brittany what is the formula for circumference Pi times d Circumference equals pi times d I m gonna ask someone to restate what Kiki said Does anyone agree with Kiki Yes I do And what did she say She said that you can divide the circumference by 3 14 Okay So we know the circumference is 8 5 correct And we know that pi is what Molly 3 14 3 14 and we re trying to find the the what Devon Diameter The diameter okay So both Kiki and Maya say you divide by 3 14 Is that what we do Treyshawn Yes So if I divide this side by 3 14 and I divide this side by 3 14 what happens to this right here India It would get smaller It gets smaller Yes if you divide it Okay what is 3 14 divided by 3 14 One Sure 
 And one more There s this one spider and he s around all day and then he comes and comes out Oh so it s waiting for him You know i ts like a trap It covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower It sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it it attacks it and eats it Wonderful so they re not really attracted to flowers they re attracted to the insects in order to ambush them Is that what you re telling me Yes Okay all right So and we talked about what is it that attracts these Well we see a lot of bugs we see humming birds and Jack mentioned this word pollen Do you know what pollen is Do you know what pollen is Ah Do you know what pollen is Are these things attracted to the pollen Yes Well not really though No not really Sometimes Sometimes I guess Say that again please It s an ingredient to make honey Pollen is an ingredient to make honey Oh nectar Yeah So bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Nectar Go ahead Jimmy How would you fill this in The bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Go ahead and write your answer in Oh okay I see some people writing pollen You have color They re definitely attracted to their color We have nectar And we have we actually have all of them here So which one is it Is it one of these or all of these All of these All of them All of them tell me more Tell me I think it s pollen and nectar because the nectar s in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff or honey out of it So it s kind of like taking it to its So we say that flowers attract insects so we can connect these two ideas here And we ve talked about their color The insects were attracted because of their color and they re also attracted because of their Nectar Nectar okay let s put nectar right here And they re also attracted because of their good smell No Yeah Yeah No The nectar smells good that s why butterflies go to them Maybe look that up on Google Why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good So bees will go to them Why do people go to trouble to smell good Why not Because it would be gross Say that again Attention You want attention You want to be attractive to other people too Heck no Maybe you re too young for that Yeah when you get older don t you want to attract other people Sure Don t you want other people to find you pleasant Yes You know it s not a big thing but are these fragrances signals to these insects They re attractive right And we ll talk about I agree they are useful but that s not going to fit into my process just yet But all of these things do attract the insects right But what is it that keeps the insects coming back It s sort of like the color the smell you know the maybe the shape of the flower All of these things are like advertisements to the insects Why For the nectar For the nectar It s the nectar that s going to keep them coming back All right you see this bee here What s all this yellow stuff on the bee Pollen Pollen Does the pollen attract the bee No Does the bee want the pollen No Yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive The pollen is definitely important to the flower right Mm hm The bees just spread it around The bees spread it around How many people are aware that bees spread pollen I see just about all your hands go up So the insects are spreading let s put that up here they re going to spread the stuff called pollen Right Of course the insects are really getting what Nectar Yeah so let s put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here right And nectar is another word for what Food You all understand that nectar is their food For the bees For the bees Just the bees No and hummingbirds And insects Us And hummingbirds Us us we have honey Nectar is technically honey So nectar is actually a food for us because we steal it from the bees right Yeah And we hide it from the bears yes Isn t there this one point where it has saliva or something in the bottom of it and it s in the shape of a picture and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything and they get into the water they can t move and everything they re paralyzed Okay it s a trap Yeah Like the venus fly trap Just like the venus fly trap Yeah I don t know what it s called Do venus fly traps have flowers No they have clear white The mouth smells really sweet That s because it catches flies Okay we re going to talk about that in a minute A lot of people when I was reading your paragraphs a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don t have flowers All right but let s look at this thing about pollen for a minute Why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar What s going on here They want them to spread the pollen but why To make more food To make what To make more food You think it s to make more food What do you think Olivia To make like honey The flowers want the bees to make honey No they like need it to make more food Pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make I understand that but why does the flower go to all this trouble Do flowers just like bees No They say hey you re a nice guy We ll make you some To keep them alive I think To keep the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive No I don t know That s okay that s okay What do you think Joe To fertilize other flowers Fertilize What s fertilize You mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground Or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer Different You re calling it a different kind of fertilizer Interesting How many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization How many people have heard that before Hands up here okay So if you want to ask what pollen is you might want to ask what flowers do All right and to answer that I first of all let s make sure this dandelion is this a flower or is this a weed Flower A weed Okay thumbs up or thumbs down Who says it s a weed Okay I see most of you thumbs up a couple of you have sideways or down Next how about this one how many people think it s a flower Okay How many people say it s a weed and a flower Now I see some people who don t know Well let me ask you this If you re to look at this here s a pretty good picture of it what makes you think it s a flower Are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it s a flower Yes I don t think it s a flower That s not my question Are there characteristics about this that make you think it s a flower Yes What would those be The petals The petals Excellent Anything else It s color It s colorful Anything else It has some nectar maybe You think it has nectar Maybe a little bit Have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions Yes Who have seen who have seen Yeah it s very common Well you can actually see bees on top of on top of flowers Here s a close up of the dandelion What do you notice there That looks a lot more ugly It looks ugly Yeah Really No it looks cool It looks like water spouts goin like It does look like water What do you see on the side here Pollen Does that look like pollen What does pollen look like Just tiny balls of stuff Of stuff yeah There those tiny little like they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it s with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower so it stays with them for a while A ball and then it sticks to the bee like if you want to see the bee it s got all the yellow stuff on his leg Yeah we had the picture earlier yeah Yeah I saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body Cool Actually that s the pollen So the pollen so it is picking up pollen So it sounds to me that I guess what I want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers They are Yeah they re definitely flowers Let me show you a picture of a dandelion A little video it s about one minute long and let s go ahead and turn the lights off And as you re watching it just tell me what you observe happening in the video Just go ahead and shout it out The flower is opening it s blossoming Okay this is time lapse so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally but you saw the flower open It s dormant dying now And now it s closing up and it s dying It s going dormant It s dead How many people think it s dead No it s still growing It s dormant It s growing into that white stuff Say that again It s turning into that thing in the ball That s like Marissa s making a prediction It s gonna grow taller No it s going to break up Do you see the insects all over it Every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it Oh yeah Yeah there s one down at the root At the very base of it Yeah something s happening Something s happening It got taller on the screen Oh the bottom petals are starting to die What s that It s starting to look like an onion What s that thing on the top It s going to blow away It s going to grow into a dandelion That was the flower wasn t it That s the thing you blow on What s that They re seeds they re seeds Yeah you blow on them and it s really fun It s reproducing I m hearing Steven say they re seeds And Brandon oh that thing disappeared That whole top blew away That s the stuff that you like to blow How many people think these are seeds I know they are Ah Andrew s thinking So the flower turned into what A seed A reproducer A big seed No they re all little seeds No they re all individual seeds Are they blowing Yes Make a wish Can I have the lights on please So you have Like a month period Yeah that took a while And I think you ve seen dandelions you may not have you ve probably seen the dandelions in two stages Sometimes they re like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white puffy seed pods right You puff on them and they blow in the wind Yeah what does the wind do It blows them away and it starts reproducing So each seed is like a little parachute Yeah And it s dispersed to new lands Yes All right so if I were to say flowers if I were to make a connection between flowers and seeds what would you say about that What will you say What is the connection between flowers and seeds McKenzie They both reproduce They re both related to reproduction Okay uh huh One makes another Okay so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds and there s that word that McKenzie was using reproduce because seeds grow into Flowers Flowers which then Grow into seeds Which then Grow into more plants What does that sound like Life cycles Wonderful wonderful these are life cycles What I m going to ask you to do right now is we re going to look at a seed very very closely I have some you know what these are Lima beans Oh I love lima beans You do really Yeah Oh I don t like lima beans I ve never tried them I like them in my favorite dish chicken pot pie My dad loves lima beans anyway I have some They have been soaking overnight in some water and they re going to look a little bit different because they ve been soaking under water What I want you to do is when you get one I want you to open it up like a book Dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully and I want you to look inside That s what the magnifying glasses are for I want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed Everyone clear Go ahead one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds How many Oh you know what Get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn t work We have a spare Three not unbroken nice plump seeds Take them to your seat I just want you to look at them They re bigger They are bigger aren t they What else are they They re sort of hard They look like mandarin oranges Why s that what makes you think they re like oranges They re not hard anymore They re no what They re not hard anymore They re not hard We grew them last year What s that We grew them last year Oh you grew these last year What do these turn into Farmer s They turn into plants What are we supposed to be looking for Well you tell me Don t break them open Here s how I want you Can I borrow this Okay I want you to go to the round part here and you notice it has like a seed coat Yeah Okay you know kind of peel that back Oh cool And then open it up like a book Okay I m looking at the skin Like this Yeah open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find There s a little surprise there What is this It s a bug It s located yeah Oh gross Mine s already broken so Well you have a good one right here This is perfect Oh I see it Look at that That s a really good one I don t see it Yeah go ahead break it Just like you did I can t open it And oh yours is right here Yours kind of fell apart Do you have another seed Be there in a second Okay Oh there it is right there Do you see that I don t have one Look at it very carefully with the magnifiers What do you have Let me see what you got Yeah right there There s actually part of it right here broke in half and that s attached and there s also a little bit here Perfect look at this Patrick That s what you want to look at I can t open mine See it see it there What do you see I don t see it Oh there is a little bit of green there isn t there Yeah Who else is having trouble Me I already opened mine Yes you did Are they supposed to smell bad Yeah they do kind of smell don t they Yeah they smell Did you see that whole thing right on the tip Look at that under the magnifying glass Okay okay look at my photograph up here Here we go This is kind of what you re looking at You have these two like little half circles little kidney shaped starchy figures but what is this thing right here It s a seed It s starting to sprout What is it It s a start of a lima bean I thought this whole thing right here It s the start of a lima bean plant This is like a plant sprouting out Is that what you re trying to say Steven What s that Is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant Like that like the big parts might be like maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger Like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger Well did you notice there are two parts to it Yeah Yeah it like goes down There is what s this right here It s the sprout Okay I heard you say it looks like a stem Anybody think it looks like anything else Uh huh Go ahead McKenzie Why are these pointing here Why are these pointed It s kind of new That makes sense Looking to break through Break through the The soil And what breaks through the soil What part of the plant breaks through the soil The seed The root Does it look like a root Yeah How many people think it looks a little bit like a root And this looks a little bit like a stem What does this look like to you A flower Let me see it looks like this and there s another one that kind of looks like that What does that look like to you Leaves Leaves What do leaves okay Do you ever see anybody draw pictures Whats that It looks like a carrot It looks like a carrot doesn t it Okay look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier I want you to look for a detail You see a little characteristic Oh I see it I see it What do you see I see like the veins of a leaf Wonderful I don t Oh yeah I do Wonderful you have little veins there on the leaf Yeah you can see 
 Three Oh it makes like a cubic graph It s like a cube Oh whoa that s pretty cool What about what if only two of them are the same It s like a quadratic All right so as we go through the investigation now we re gonna look at try to come up with conjecture for that Numerically why do you think that happens If two factors are the same Because it makes like because if you have two factors are the same that s the same as like squaring one of the factors What happens if you square numbers They become positive I believe So it s always positive for that section Very nice Okay keep on keep on going with that All right Just say A B C D E etcetera E is the zeros of the law I m on the first one Why are they the same They re squared Go to Google Docs See if you can do files The file is gray Okay so what s gonna happen is you re gonna have a factor formula Unlike the other one we had it instead And what you want to look at is look at the factors and look at the zeros What s the relationship between the factors and zeros You may already know what the relationship is Can you predict what it s gonna be That the factors tell you the zeros Like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are And why would that makes sense to you Oh because when it s X and you have a number after that that s where it is on the X axis So that could be where the zeros in a set right maybe Teresa does that make sense to you You look kinda confused Like so X minus one is No that is wrong then Well here look at your flag Look right here It s sittin right here So X minus one So that s one So there s one one And then X minus two is the there too Oh so it s the opposite of the form So if you haven t factored form then you know that it s even zero Yeah yeah It would be equal to zero right Yeah you re right Remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing Yeah All right so that does make sense Does the end behavior make sense It s in factored form but what s the degree of that It s three It s the third degree And what does a third degree what did we learn last time It can intersect three times It can intersect three times Does it Yeah And what s the end date Down and up Down and up And it is right Yup So that makes sense That does make sense Why don t you try it with quadratic factor here And why don t you put in an extra factor Just edit that Just add that X whatever something we ve not used yet What s the F in this one The eraser But you added this one right Yeah So what do we except s gonna happen How many zeros are we gonna get this time Four What s the degree So what should the end behavior be Because you weren t here last time so let s see if you pick it up So if it s fourth degree what s gonna happen on the right What s gonna happen on the left Both Good Yay High five Get rid of the space after the parenthesis Which one Between the parenthesis and the F Yeah add a space There s not an F See the sliders here This F was there to start out with So just delete it then Yeah just delete that So X minus E is just that So we expect did it come out the way you excepted it to come out Yeah there s four zeros And if you slide those zeros go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense Oh that s good Oh because it changes whatever the final one would be at So if we had like X plus something where is the actual zero Oh it is X plus something it s the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place So if we say X X plus three where s the zero Negative three Does that make sense Because X plus three equals zero Yeah All right what s the next question on there Does the Y intercept change All right so let s look at your zeros and look at your Y intercept As you change the sliders does the Y intercept change We can t see our Y intercept you gotta scroll out Mr Dillard would you get me me the mouse over there The silver one Yeah it s a lot easier to do this with a mouse I got it Other way Because the Y intercept is Now it might be really Yeah it s right there Why don t we try making some of these factors smaller so that we can see it a little better I got it Oh fine I see how it is Okay can you see it It s like at negative 15 Okay is there a relationship between that Y intercept and the factors Or the zeros Why don t you guys talk it over What are the zeros So the zeros are what are the zeros And the zeros are all the numbers that are they re the opposite of this So it would be negative two four and a half and one Wait what s the Y intercept It s 15 Two Yeah it s down here It s actually 18 And it s negative 18 Four and a half times two is nine times two is 18 times one It s 18 You multiply all the end numbers together and you get the Y intercept Well that s nice That is cool But why does that make sense Why would that work Why does that work Oh Because to get the Y intercept the Y intercept doesn t have an X value so you just in order to factor this equation you would just multiply all the end ones to get it Oh yeah because it s the numbers after X like almost zeros zeros Well are the numbers after X the actual zeros If it said X plus three The roots X plus three what would the zero be for that Negative So they re the inverse of the zeros The opposite The opposite yeah You have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning All right so if we know what the zeros are and we multiply those and we got the Y intercept right Yeah What about A What happens when you slide A around Does that change Slide A around I already know what should happen You can just use the mouse I can t click it Move Oh that s why It changes the middle one Did it change the zero Start with that Does it change the zeros at all No No No it doesn t change the zeros Well okay go back to It s not changing the zero Well actually Well it s just changing it s steepness Yeah it s changing it s steepness and the width but it s not changing the zeros Well yeah it does because when it s flat then every number s changed But when its flat but that s only If A is zero since they re multiplying everything by A then if A is zero everything is zero So yeah you have a zero degree polynomial at that point Yeah Yeah Okay so other than when A is zero All it s changing is the steepness of the graph And not changing the zeros So does that change the Y intercept Um yes it is changing the Y intercept But I think it still works out as um you can still multiply all of them together Does that make sense Check and see if it still works Oh whatever A is is A is the opposite of the Y intercept Because if A is four then the Y intercept here is or that might just be Well that s a good conjecture Check some of the other things and see if it still works Um try changing yeah Yeah no that s not right That would be cool It was just the way I had it And that s one of the nice thing with the sliders because you might see a connection but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case The Y intercept is six Yeah it s still ah when you change A it s still going to effect the Y intercept and as changing as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by A Does that make sense Yeah So all those numbers multiplied together is still six Keep going with this because the next thing we re gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same When we use the factor more than once Okay Keep going Are we on six now Yes What happens when two or more factors are the same So make E and E I m gonna make them all three I work hard for you guys you criticize me Um the E the E Oh it makes the when they re the same Try changing one of them Try changing one of the sliders We figured that one It just turns out to be the opposite So go ahead and change one slider Just pick one other than A Pick B or something like that The opposite of that variable becomes the Y intercept That doesn t explain the zeros Now something we want to find out Is there a relationship between the zeros and the Y intercept Oh there is When you change the Y then the zeros equal the opposite of the Y intercept Okay what happens if you change two No it doesn t Oh yeah yeah it does Oh yeah zero does The one that isn t the same numerical I think The right most zero becomes it When you move them the Y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate Because if you move like C steadily to the left once C is two negative two Jacob said Half the time when you multiply them all together you get it Yeah that s what we re discussing The absolute value of the Y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero if two of the factors are the same that s in If all of the variables are the same except one of them it becomes the zero it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept So now as you slide you ll actually be able to see the Y intercept If you set all the variables the same and change one of them it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept Okay so on Dave s right here Yeah the multiplication in case you like if you multiply all the zeros together you get the opposite of the Y intercept Does it have to do with the factor formula Yeah Yeah So the absolute value of the If you multiply the zero So does it make sense algebraically Yes Why does it make sense algebraically When you find the factor with that new grouping you have to it becomes the opposite But Y intercepts algebraically Because the Y intercept is when all the X s are zeros so you re just left with the one that doesn t have an X on it And that is the multiplication of all the factors All the numbers 
 Do you want to measure this separately Or do you want to measure this with the ground water Should we measure this separately Yea cause that s the round rocks Okay what were you saying Cathy Why is the ground water cleaner Because the permeable rocks They clean the water on its way down to the soil saturation There s 100 milliliters and you guys could you record the data real quick Write Ground oh no but we ve got to add this first Yea Wait we ve got to add Is it still But let s do the Is that too much Let s do the answer for number one while we re on it Okay It says Good job Describe what you would do Stop But why is your head right down level with the measurement We re doing that so we can make sure it s exactly even cause if we go over then we won t know exactly how much it is And are you measuring the runoff or the ground water right now Right now we re measuring the runoff It was about 380 It was about 380 Is it okay to get an approximate amount for the volume for this and not an exact amount I think so cause then when we measure this we could still Exactly Ashlyn which had more water Your runoff or your ground water The ground water The ground water had more Yeah Yeah cause they re overflowing Oh my goodness Have you measured your ground water yet Not yet I think you can see it for video Where is your ground water Oh oh I see Oh so this really did overflow Yes So when you measure your ground water what will you need to do with the water that s here in the tray I think put it in with the ground water Yea and measure that too Okay this is your runoff Yes Okay so so far you have how much About 380 And then there s some in here Oh you ve already measured 380 About Oh So that s 100 You are pouring that so carefully Jade Stop Good Because we want to have it exact so I had to Okay Ashlyn So Jade put in 100 once and then she put 100 in a second time So how much water has she put in there so far 200 How did you get 200 Um Be sure you talk nice and loudly honey Because I got it because plus it equals 200 because you put two in there Nice Good job Looks like you re doing great kids 60 Keep going Keep going Looks like it might have been slightly off Better watch it go Okay so maybe if we I think that s good but should we add the should I add the data in now No we needed that did you pour on water because that also Wow looks like we re getting a lot of data Your recharge is high Trial number one why do you say runoff had more water in trial number one I think because it clay s more harder so it s kind of more difficult to go through with So what is this number 790 What is this number 62 And which is greater 790 Yea 790 s greater than 62 Good for you honey How did you get this number dear I think we added them up What did you add up honey 790 and 600 I mean 62 To get this total Yeah Great I have a question for this group though How much water did you pour in on trial one 1 000 1 000 what Milliliters 1 000 milliliters But your total is only 852 milliliters It s still in the zone of saturation Oh Or it hasn t collected off the first Alright But it s interesting maybe the water from last time since we only had 852 ending last time Maybe this time the second sort of Maybe it some might against the window if the water from last time I wonder if it came down in the aquifer I wonder Maybe it s just holding it in there I wonder it ll be interesting to measure this time So what part do you have in your lab note We re adding we re have to answer question two and then we re measuring Describe what you observed when you poured the water over the ground water the second time What changed Taylor you go first Um well I think what changed is since the clay sort of got use to the water the first time and there wasn t very much water on the recharge water the first time and it got used to the clay got used to the water that there are little cracks or the water slipped through the sides and it went and now we ve got more recharge water than we had on our first one Do you think that could happen in real life Do you think we could have an impermeable surface like clay and then it could crack and let water through Why do you think that could happen in real life Some place that might happen for real A bunch of pressure If it rains for like millions and millions of years maybe like cement or gravel It would break it down and it would have like a little Do you remember the term for that Weather rock Yeah Weather rock Like what s in the middle of the road Yeah sure yeah Because when people drive on it it gets so much pressure And people keep driving on it and it cracks sometimes Sure And I m sorry I interrupted you when you were answering question number two I wonder if the I doubt anyone would do this but if we put pollution on clay If you put what honey Pollution on like cement of something I would wonder if it would get through Like sort of like water sometimes and since the clay s impermeable water can t get through it easily but I wonder if pollution would That s a good question you might want to do that experiment when you re done with this one That d be great to check Good job The clay became more permeable the second time we added the water Yes And then we should probably measure how much is in here Yes Oh that s kind of Yea because it s like soapy It is sort of soapy I think it s because of the clay being wet Look on this side Oh yeah I can see some of the white So why is the about 120 Because it s not quite at 150 but it s a little bit over 100 Is close close enough for this Or how do you know when close is close enough for this Um we know when it s close enough for this because it doesn t really have an exact measurement for 120 so we know that it s kind of half way between 150 and 100 little bit lower than 125 There s a lot more recharge than last time A lot more recharge Yeah We had 760 now we have 435 Holy cow The first time you did this you had 760 Milliliters Milliliters of runoff And this time we had 435 milliliters Oh that is a big change I wonder I wonder what will happen with your recharge have you measured that yet Yeah what was it It was I think it was 871 Oh my goodness Why do you think you had so much more recharge the second time you did this Christian Probably because the ground probably got more moist so it would make it easier to slip right through Do you remember the term for that When the ground gets all wet with water Soil saturation Great Well yea I mean the water level must have gotten higher Why do you say that Because the bigger the saturation is and the higher the water table is the more moist the ground is The ground is so the water can go through easier I think the first time we did it the water went through which made it easier for the second time to go through Cause it made it more moist And the rock pebbles were kind of scattered around probably mixed with the water So that s the pattern you re seeing What do you predict will happen on your third trial I m thinking that there will be maybe maybe possibly more recharge than runoff More recharge than runoff Did you have more recharge than runoff the second time No but we always have the tape on and it s less than 100 So they started like this and now they re equal and now you think the third time they ll Yea Oh Because probably since the soil s even more moist now that it will make it go through the cracks And Jasper what did your group discuss that you observed the second time you poured in the water that was different from the first time you poured it in The runoff water was kind of even with the recharge But before you measured it before you were just making your observations and watching what did you observe That the first time that there was there was more runoff because the dirt wasn t that moist Oh Great so that s what you wrote down for your number two And I have a question for you Christian How much water are you the drain person Yeah How much rain did you pour in on trial number one 1 000 milliliters So this is interesting How much did you measure after trial number one 900 So what happened to the rest of the water It stayed into the soil Oh So that s why the soil s all wet Cause there s still water underneath it So it s like How did you get 100 Because 900 plus 100 equals 1 000 Good job Alright I ll leave you to it Four three five would equal Okay we need to have less water than the last time 
 Dan do you have any background knowledge about density Like if someone says It s dense out Yeah Then it would be kinda wet So if something s really like if there was a dense fog yeah it d be So if there was a dense fog what does that mean to you That there s a lot There s a lot of it okay So you re in San Francisco and they re like Hey there s a really dense fog You might expect that there s a lot of fog Alright what would be the opposite of a dense fog A not dense fog No fog or like a really thin fog Okay Jackson do you have any background information Well I thought that isn t it like how close the molecules are together How close the what The molecules are together How closely they are okay Yeah Like say you re trying to go through a screen door And like they aren t really very close together because they res holes Okay And say you re trying to go through a brick wall Okay And they re really close together so it will be harder to go through Would you say then which one would be densest the brick wall or the screen door The brick wall The brick wall and you would say that because Because the molecules are closer together The molecules are closer together Okay anybody else have any ideas about density Yes ma am Isn t it like how compact something is Okay so give me an example Like um don t know how to say this kinda going back to the container thing If we could have luggage and you fill it up so much the luggage case is like so filled up it s so dense Okay so let me take that to the next level So let s pretend we re going on vacation Okay we re going on vacation Raise your hand if you have a place you want to go Or maybe you re going there next week I d be so jealous if you said Hawaii Oh yeah I could be Reese where are you going Or where would you want to go Uuh Mexico You re going to Mexico Well not this break in the in the summer In the summer Alright so let s build this scenario He s got one of those big huge rolling bags that you re gonna put all of your swimsuits in To go to Mexico because you don t need other clothes Flip flops swimsuits and a t shirt and that s it Okay so you got your huge luggage we re gonna pile all this stuff in there I m gonna zip it up What does that have to do with density If it s absolutely packed full what does that mean for the luggage Yeah That the particles are so close together that it s leaving them in Is the volume of the luggage changing if it keeps its shape Or is the mass of the luggage changing because you re adding more stuff to it The mass So you change the mass because the luggage is staying the same Okay your mom says You can only bring one swimsuit one flip flop a pair of flip flops and one t shirt So I take everything out now did I change the volume by it or did I change the mass of the luggage The mass I just changed the amount of matter right So then the luggage with tons of stuff in it we said was what dense or not dense Dense And dense and so the luggage with a little bit of stuff in it was Less dense What changed the density of the luggage What are the other conclusions to what changed the density of the luggage Peter what changed the density of the luggage Less amount Less amount and in science which word do we use Umm Volume or mass on that one Umm mass Less mass less stuff less matter in the luggage Awesome we re gonna do this little scenario with a demonstration so you guys need your clickers it s gonna be an A or a B type answer on this one So get your clicker ready and I m gonna show you a couple of clips Cheese Ooooh Cheese Can we eat it when some people in here don t like it I know well more for me right What What Alright so this is cheese This morning I went to Safeway and I purchased this cheese that is extremely difficult to open And I bought certain kinds of cheese Can I have some Alright So Do we get to eat the cheese You do not Aww dang it Sorry Why can t we eat it So here s your question This is cheese A okay Anybody know what kind of cheese that it is Grayson what s cheese A Umm Swiss Swiss what s your observation that led you to the inference that this is Swiss cheese That is has the little holes in it The little holes in it Okay this is regular old Cheddar Raise your hand Yeah Dan know what it is Cheddar or This is a Cheddar cheese Okay So this is cheese A and this is cheese B I want to know which cheese is denser Okay so with your clicker I m gonna put this up on the screen I want to know cheese A the Swiss cheese or cheese B Are they supposed to be numbers Well it s gonna be an A or a B Right so cheese A or cheese B Alright and if you need to see the cheese again walk around In the meantime I ll put this question up I want to know is cheese A the densest Or is cheese B the densest Okay so this is multiple choice A or B There we go go ahead and click it And let s see what you guys think about which cheese is the densest So the Cheddar is B So A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar That doesn t make a lot of sense A is the Swiss Are we each going to be able to get a piece Please don t talk while we re doing this My clicker isn t working It s not working Which number are you 83 Is it on Yeah Are you pressing the right button Send Oh there it goes Okay good It probably didn t power Alright make sure you clicked in please And then let s look at what we think Okay 92 of you said that the cheddar was the densest So we had another 8 so two people said that this was the densest So here s what I want you to do I want you to pull a partner who s just the person next to you So you guys are gonna be partners you guys are partners you guys are partners and you re gonna be a group of three Partner partner partner Mattie and Grayson and you guys will partner Sydney and Jackson and it s kinda gonna go crossways here So you guys will be a partner You guys are a partner and you guys are a partner Right you re going to turn to your partner tell your partner which cheese you thought was the densest and then I want you to come up with a conclusion that you could say Cheese A was the densest because or Cheese B was the densest because So take 30 seconds to talk Less mass Cheddar So what is the definition of density from here to the cheese Which one is denser the one with more stuff or less stuff More So which of these has more stuff Ooh Nice of you guys and you re not very nice Okay that was 30 seconds Okay choose which person in your group is gonna be Swiss cheese and which person gonna be Cheddar Swiss Cheddar Swiss Cheeses raise your hand please Woo Swiss cheese And I need a conclusion from you so make a statement for me We thought cheese A was the densest because so Erica We thought cheese B was the densest because it didn t have any holes Because it didn t have any holes okay Does anybody have a different explanation why they thought cheese B was the densest Matt Well because cheese A had holes the holes don t take in the part of the technical isn t part of the cheese Okay So So the inside of the holes what are the holes actually made up of Air So there s air in there but it s not part of the cheese So then what s true about the Swiss cheese then Reily It has the less cheese Less cheese compared to its what Compared to has all of it So it s all cheese and this is part cheese What can we say now about their volumes Umm they re pretty much the same Okay so the volume is the same Jackson what can we say about the mass of the Swiss compared to the mass of this guy The Swiss has less mass than the Cheddar cheese So the Swiss has less mass then the Cheddar But they have the same volume can we figure out then which one s the densest Which one s the densest What s both alright You had a chance to talk about it let s vote again Do you think cheese A is the densest or cheese B is the densest After our little discussion Cheese A or cheese B A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar So we want to know who s more dense More dense yep Which one is more dense More dense Is A more dense or is B more dense Let s see if we get an agreement on our inference here about which one s denser Look at that we were able to change two people s minds just through discussion That s pretty awesome I thought it would be eight people Well we went all the way to 100 here So that s good That means that everybody agreed at least in terms of the cheese So as a demonstration What Well I need a snack this is really hard work being a teacher It s hard to be a student That s true Okay ready for demo number two Yeah So cheese number one number two first we need to talk about what sinking floating and suspending means I know it So in order to talk about this I have these fun objects I don t know has anybody stayed up late enough to see David Letterman Yes Oh gosh I lost an animal has anybody on David Letterman ever seen the game show he plays called Will it float Yeah I ve seen it happen Have you Wyatt What does he do Do you know what he does Well I saw it a while ago so I don t relaly remember So you re not really sure Anybody wanna guess what he does on the show He throws stuff in water He takes some stuff then he puts it in water to sees if it floats or not That s pretty much the gist of the game show So I have for your viewing pleasure recreated a game show So I have objects we re gonna play a game called Will it float And the first object you re going to predict this through the clicker Is I wanna know if our little dolphin friend is it going to float okay sink or the third option which is tricky you might not know this word suspend And suspends means hang out kinda in the middle of the water So you have three options alright We re gonna vote on this with the clickers Do you have a question before we do that When you put it to the test can I move forward Absolutely so if you can t see you can either stand up or you can squeeze up into an aisle yeah absolutely Yes sir Which one is it A B or C Oh I m gonna tell you right now okay So we re gonna see if the dolphin floats sinks or suspends And if you can t see when I do it we ll count and you can stand up and watch So A is gonna be sink so do you think it s gonna sink B answer B will be float C will be suspend Okay so sink float suspend which means hang out in the middle of the water Okay so this is an A through C option Okay A sink B float or C suspend Well that was fast Yeah that was really fast So let s see everyone oooo object is going to sink If it sinks what will you observe If it sinks what will you observe How fast It falling into the water Well he s going to fall into the water one way or another but where will he end up On the bottom At the bottom of that okay Some of you one person said that it s gonna float Okay so raise your hand if you re the person who thinks it s gonna float Okay thank you for taking a risk that s okay You don t know yet right it s for fun So if its floating what will that mean what will you observe That s she right When I put this in the water what will it look like when it s floating Like I don t know Will it will be sitting on the bottom No Where will it be located Floating on the Floating right on the top okay And then we had oooooh three whole people said it would suspend right in the middle Raise your hand if you think it s gonna suspend Oh yeah Okay Leia why do you think it s gonna go right in the middle I think it s too light for it to totally sink and I think it s took heavy for it to float so thought it would be right in the middle Okay so you re making the hypothesis it has something to do with its weight Okay alright so that s one idea Too light to stay at the top But too heavy would go to the bottom Is that what you said Okay yes So does suspend mean it stays in the middle Yeah suspend means it literally hangs out right here Yeah Okay that s not true Okay are you guys ready Yes So stand up if you need to be able to see Here s the game show there s a little song that goes with it like Will it float will it float Okay there s my game show you ready Alright it s very suspenseful Can you see Okay here it goes Yes Aww yeah So it sank So go back and have a seat please Now raise your hand if you have any explanation for me why that sank It did sink oh no We ve all been down to the bottom of the pool Why do you think it sank I thought it wasn t flat enough or didn t have enough space enough to float up So now we ve got two different ideas about sinking and foating So Leia brought up the idea of heaviness you brought up the idea of surface area See if I were to put something that has a bigger surface area is it gonna float No Yes Maybe did you tell me that if it had bigger surface on top of the water Okay should we try this Yeah It s gonna sink Oooh Okay so maybe Aaaaw It got swamped Now it floated for a little while right So maybe the shape does have something to do with it and maybe weight has something to do with it Or what it s made out of might have something to do with it So we have all kinds of ideas now about sinking and floating Yes sir Is it because it s denser than water So here s another idea it has something to do with the density of the object It s denser than water So here s a tough question so think about this one What is the difference between how dense something is and how heavy something is If Leia talked about heaviness now we ve got density and now we ve got shape and what it s made of and all these different things so I just want to know this one thing What s the difference between the weight of an object and the density of an object This is a really hard question take a second I want you to rotate back to your partner talk to them about what you think the difference between density and weight is Okay when we talked about number of particles it s later than mass Mass Mass so the relationship between mass compared to the object Okay Okay who spoke last time cause I need a cheddar Oh yeah A cheddar who s willing to talk Emily what did you guys come up with So density is like how much mass or how many particles are in the object And weight is how much gravity is pulling down Okay So would that mean that something That s heavier automatically sink Hang on one sec And then we ll try to work through this one If something is heavier than something else will it automatically sink Are ships heavy Do ships sink Occasionally right Especially if you re on that cruise ship like last week did you hear about that It depends on the Okay now we re talking about depends what it s in So now we ve got all these different ideas working Holy cow Yes ma am anything else to add I was gonna say I don t know why I m just gonna hook on this whole list of things but like a tin can will float if it s empty because of the air that s stuck inside of it holds the object up So if that was hollow I m guessing that it would most likely float So the ships are hollow in the bottom the air that keeps it up but the bottom how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn t hollow That part sinks but the air in the boat will keep it up and that s how things float 
 First are your group activity your group creations Now you all created in your group Sorry You created in your groups eight counts of dance that incorporated in some form or fashion the time step I don t want don t grade right now just look just watch the first one What are you noticing Good right So I was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread or I can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread We re going to keep the white bread for right now Pop push Then this made me laugh Think about this as the heel of the bread I don t get it I m glad to know that you re like I don t get it There s a piece of bread and there s a heel of the bread Oh The butt of the bread Yeah Oh that s why Because you call it the butt of the bread Oh But it s the heel of the bread Ok so not so funny So we have pop push step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread good flap step dig right So today we re going to do pop push step good flap step dig as a review on the right and on the left And then we re going to do pop push flap we re going to add another ingredient flap step dig Okay Flap step dig Now remember this is important why It s the ingredient barely comes up think about it Good flap because when you step flap means that it s two sounds to Boo ya Remember it s two sounds and that s why you say Good flap and to get it up she said real high Alright everybody up spread out Pop push Pop push again is spank kick It s exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board Put your right heel out I need a good pop push Ready and I need a good step As we step what do we do What happens to the body We swing right We sure did pick up that foot Good flap step dig Alright do it one more time Let s do an echo Let me do it I ll do pop push step you do Pop push step I do good flap step dig You do Good flap step dig Right right And I go Okay I go Better Ok by now our muscle memory is either going I got it I ve worked it out or I don t got it and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory So here s what I want you to do Say Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Right foot out Six here you go You take Pop push step Good flap step dig Pop push step Good flap step dig You can do a shuffle Pop push step Good flap step dig You want to Okay Not too bad Look at y all keep on going just like wonderful kids Now let me take a dip What I need you to do real quick bunch up right here Bunch up Do me a favor and bunch up right there Do you body roll Not really Yeah you do No Sure you do Ok well I got it wrong You don t body roll but you will You rock you rock knee right No Come on right hand Flap step dig See you re doing this really well Alright point your leg listen We re going flap step dig Flap step dig Ready And right foot step flap step dig Yes How is this group doing Okay everybody look everybody look Here we go Five six oh you precious thing Are you ready Deep breaths You need your right foot out Six ready and pop push step Good flap step dig Almost left foot Pop push step Left foot good flap step dig Okay let me tell you why You re doing a shuffle We do pop push step lift your foot up good flap step dig on left foot Pop push step Good flap step dig These were all two things Okay body roll Do a body roll Now you can t do a body roll back here Hold my hand Here we go Pop push Step Shift it over Good flap step dig right here Good flap step dig Did you get all this Again the right foot Flex your toes Good flap step dig Good flap step dig bring it in Oh no you gotta body roll Bring it in Good flap step dig That s better And since the problem is your weight distribution it s back here and it s hard to do it like this So you gotta do like this Yeah Okay Alright let me see the middle group Middle group Right foot out Ready oh sorry I got all excited You were ready Six ready and pop push step Yes okay Let s go pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig Ready Right foot And pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig Yes Left foot left foot left foot Six ready and pop push step good flap step dig Almost almost I saw it on the right do it on the left real quick Left foot and pop push push your heel down Base Let me hear some base do it again Pop push step pick up that foot good flap step dig Good flap step dig Left foot good flap come on baby With the lift With the lift Oh sorry my bad my bad to the right Good flap step dig That s it Show some love very nice Alright this group come on Right foot out Six ready and pop push step Oh I got overachievers I love it This time with the hold punched in it Now let me see the hold Six ready and pop push step hold for a second good flag step dig Left foot Pop push step hold for a sec good flap step dig Love it Let s take out the hold Let s take out the hold Pop push step good flap step dig Pop push step good flap step dig Five six right foot ready and Pop push step good flap step dig And ready stop You know what Not so bad Alright this is what we re going to do We re going to move on we re going to move on I want to see pop push FLAP Pop push flap on the right foot Put your right heel out Put your right heel out We re gonna go pop push flap Where s my head Over you Over the front of the body that s right Five six ready and pop push flap Five six ready and pop push flap Yes five six ready and pop push flap Five six ready and pop push flap Not bad Five six last time in push and freeze We re going to take a second piece of bread that heel and go good flap step dig It happens with the left foot Five six ready and good flap step dig You already know that part Isn t that fabulous So we re going to put together pop push flap flap step good Five six right foot goes pop push flap flap step dig Oh Wah Say it for a second Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Say it Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Let me see the next move In the shower Be careful you might slip That s a hazard always safety first Yes Okay Andra In Walmart In Walmart really Love it Okay I do mines in Kroger Do you find okay I do mines in the kitchen You do yours in the kitchen Does your mom yell at you No Be careful Like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there all year Okay so Jasline do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class No cause I m quiet Because you re quiet Well number one I m super proud of you for practicing everywhere And do you find that you do it all the time In the store in the school So it s not just something that you re going to do in class You see this And what you re going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go Oh well I continue to do this and I m not even taking tapping I wish I could go find and tap more Okay when that s gonna happen because it is going to happen to you it s like a bug it s like a virus you just get all excited and all that Go to Youtube for me and on Youtube there are lots of how to videos Do you know you could look up how to do this time step on the Youtube video Now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc buck times step No No it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich a different kind of time step So if you re ever curious and you want to continue this through like because you re gonna Do you have to have tap shoes by the way No No What do you have to have Hard floor Tammy sit up for me You what A shoe with a hard bottom Yeah Look I m in heels right That s all you have to do Now one of the things that I wanted to point out to you as we re about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers I want you to look at weight distribution Say weight distribution Weight distribution What is weight distribution Can I use an example Yes Like when we re doing the good flap ball change you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step beat Okay so great Jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back and sit it back down for the step dig Anybody had something to add Shift your weight Yes you re right you shift your weight which way Opposite of which way you switch your knee Oh opposite of which way of whatever foot I m using because if I have this foot up I ve got right Does my body have to turn No No but it kind of does don t it Got some hip action going on right here Alright anybody else see any weight distribution We can do the sink you re kind of down a little bit Okay I was going to say I was trying to get to you The weight distribution doesn t necessarily have to go right to left right Or front to back It can go up and down What is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered So we can move Move To have to have a better base for what Okay so we can keep the rhythm Because if the rate of speed speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it right Tell me how different how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males Anybody know the difference We covered this one Where s the woman s center of gravity In her glut You are absolutely correct In her glut right through here and that s where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers her center of gravity around her belly the baby belly and around Idk Oh Idk alright you don t know So where is the men s center of gravity Where do they tend to Torso Torso Right their diaphragm and that s where we get that spare tire from A man s center of gravity and this is what it means are we here There we are Here s what it means As the woman s center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you re fine and dandy A man if this is him he s going forward He s going to fall He s not going to be able to keep his weight So it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution Yes Let s look really quickly Oh how many of you have taught your significant adult You taught a significant adult and you taught the time step What did you see anybody Sometimes your parents got the rhythm has lost If your parents are a little older than most average parents let s say like 40s to 50s Good good Their rhythm has kind lost it It takes a longer time to teach them They have to be concentrated because they re like Uh uh do that again do that again Okay Jasline that is awesome I m going to put you on hold for a minute because I have heard from you several times Let me hear from somebody new Come on Audrey I found that I really got my skills from my mom My fast learning skills You got your fast learning skills from your mom awesome She learned real fast She picked it up good Alright who else Instead of teaching a significant adult I taught my whole family to tap You taught your whole family Rock on I found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother So why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom I think she slowed down over the years Over the years okay Okay let me hear from somebody up here because I haven t heard anything from up here While I was teaching my mama my daddy got excited and he wanted to so I taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and Right competition And my mama she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time once he got it he could do it over and over again He actually got pretty good like speed wise See Tap is for all ages guys It ll keep you in good health it s something fun it ll keep you active You don t have to learn a certain you know we learned a step and I hate to teach a step but that s the beautiful thing about tapping it s you can come up with all kinds of stuff And you know Hey look here I want you to hear How many of you like step step dancing Oh all around the room Oh we love the step dancing right Step and tap are similar do you see the correlations You re making rhythms there are prescribed movements So we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing You just never know You might have tap groups all around Let s go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick I want you to watch the screen Now what I want you to watch 
 Like the chocolate one with the strawberries that we looked at that is going to serve approximately 24 people So if you multiple that by two that s approximately 48 that you should charge if you re going to charge for your cakes Now it s going to depend on did you really put that much time energy and effort into it and do you feel like you really need to charge that That s going to have a little bit of basis to how much you are going to charge but that will kind of give you an idea what to charge for your cakes Think about it too serving sizes for cakes are typically two inches square They re small so when you are thinking But that s a little cake well serving size is tiny It s not that you are going to serve them a whole meal out of cake It s just for them to get a taste Sculpted cakes like the catfish cake that we looked at 100 plus When I looked these up specifically for something as big as that catfish cake because it was a pretty good size catfish cake We tried to make it as realistic as possible and it was about this tall So probably somewhere at 150 200 level had we bought that at a bakery The wedding cake like Jessie s wedding cake that we ve seen somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 because it was a seven tiered masterpiece as well Who has a question Come on somebody has got a question I wanna make a 3D cake Okay when do you wanna make one I don t know They re fun So if you were going to make a 3D cake what would you make Catfish Okay Britney s making a catfish Okay Erica s making a dinosaur Oh my favorite Piggies butterflies what else What would you like to try Penguin duck basketball panda bear would be cute A tire Brandi I wanna see your tire cake when you get that done A monkey would be fun That would be really cute So you guys are starting to think 3D We need to be thinking about your roses too Because we gotta work on those roses and get that technique down Let s go over to our table and I ll show you about making those roses Okay so when we get our snow day tomorrow I expect you to go home and practice practice practice practice practice If it s snow we probably will get out Watch Facebook Brandi Or listen to the news That s how we ll find out I always post it to my Facebook whenever they tell us You guys already know about fixing your pastry bags and this one is already fixed and it s all ready to go You know me I like wrapping it up One of my just little tricks I like to use for this if it starts getting sticky on the outside Which actually I know you have struggled with this these are not my friends These are my friends That s my first tip My second tip is if you re going to use a plastic bag take a paper towel and just turn it into your handle And the other thing is don t fill your bag so full It really only needs to be filled to about halfway maybe a little bit more than halfway okay Then what you ll do is you ll start rolling it down As you re rolling it down typically what I do first is I fold it in kind of at a triangle Then I start rolling it down The reason for that is so when I start putting pressure on it s got both those folds and then another fold to keep it from escaping Other people like to do the toothpaste thing and twist It s totally up to you how you want to do that Either one is totally acceptable Just feel what works best for you okay Then I make my little handle out of my paper towel Remember on the tips You will notice on the tips especially the Wilton tips has a number That number is representative of how big the hole is The larger the number the larger the hole That works on the writing tips Someone tell me what number is on that one Okay tell me what number is on that one Erica It s on the outside Okay yours is a number 12 Five You ve got a number five It says a 230 Okay a 230 One Okay and why A one what A one M that means one monster No I don t know what the M stands for What is the difference though between this tip and this tip They re pretty much the same thing What would you use this one for For big cakes Or for Wait don t I got this You ve got it okay come on Ashley What would you use it for Borders Borders Yes great answer Absolutely I m telling you by the time you have finished your masterpiece and you re ready to do the borders get the big ones cause you re ready to be done with it If you pick one of these little teeny tiny ones by that time you re sick of working with frosting and you re ready to do something else But this one s just a number 16 See how tiny that is Okay rose tips The bigger the number the bigger the holes Also on your rose tip make sure that the large opening end is going down If this is awkward for you all you have to do to adjust your tip loosen it and then twist it around and then tighten your tip You don t want to tighten it so much that it s gonna take a pair of pliers to get it loose okay Let s see if I can get this back in business Okay you ve got your rose nails You re just going to put a little squirt of frosting and it doesn t have to be very big and I m making a big mess now Hold it down Lay it straight down on your waxed paper and now you ve got your basis for your rose This is what we re gonna build the roses on We have to make a pyramid of frosting to start out with Remember that on the Power Point The first one I m gonna do is I m gonna rotate this counter clockwise and make my little pyramid See that little circle in the middle That s going to be the very inside of the rosebud Actually you could pull these off after you let them set up Stick them on a plate or on a cookie sheet stick them in the freezer and you could have lots of little rosebuds to set on your cake Just add your little leaves add your little vines and make you a really pretty little rosebush out of that If you want it a little bit bigger you just squeeze and rotate all at the same time It s about pressure and release So if you wanted a little rose you would pull it off right about now If you want a little bit bigger we re gonna build it up My frosting is getting warm but that s okay There s a little bit bigger one It s starting to flop over on me because it s getting really warm in here The more petals you add to the outside the bigger your rose is going to be Did you see that It just about flew onto the floor Could you tell me what this would be used for Yes That one is actually to decorate cupcakes So if we had a whole bunch of cupcakes this is so you can do some really delicate work inside the very delicate areas Like if you have them all lined up and you re trying to do them really fast you can just do that Usually what they will do that for is you know the little curly things that look like a little snake on the top Have you seen them They just go shhhhh That s what they use that for It kind of is fun One other way that you can do your frosting pyramid is just go straight down and squeeze and just bring it straight up So now we ve got our cute little middle of our cute little rose going Yeah it sticks straight up and we re just gonna wrap our little petals around it There we go See how cute that is It looks just like one that you just picked right off my little rosebush Some of my white roses at home look like that That one is cute that one s a good one Let s see if I can finish this off We ll do this one tiny The smaller you want to make them you just add a smidge of pressure instead of a lot of pressure If you add a lot of pressure you re gonna make a big rose It is it s getting really warm Who has a question about making these cute little roses Okay and I know you guys are masters at using your little star tips for shell borders All right so lets see what you can do I think you got your tables set Who would like to use this tip Simone Do you need a rose tip Okay I ll come around and check on you and see how you re doing I want to see your masterpieces I wanna see a couple of good roses from each of you Kimberly do you all need a rose tip over here Do you need that Okay Sorry let me get out of your way Do we just do one or two I want you to practice your borders and I want you to practice your rose tips So if you have a rose tip at your table you ll probably have to share I ll come around and check on you and see how it s going and if you have any problems or questions let me know I have a question That is a good question It should be but it s not Don t use this one This works best if you take your bag and just snip it and just drop it straight back in the bag Because this coupler is not designed to fit on this particular one I ll get you a different one you can try Brandi have you used the super star one that makes have you used the leaf tip yet No Let s try leaves The big giant one This will not fit on here with your coupler You ll have to use a different frosting bag Most everything else that s out you can use This one actually you might have fun with this one This one makes swirlies Cool it just makes lines you just zigzag it All the star tips are right here Err not the star but the rose No I think all of them are out You guys will have to wait and trade out with each other Yep they re all out I just suck at this No you don t Let me see Start with this Christina Hold your handle Handles are our friends Ooh it looks like a square rose It does look like a square rose that s cool Okay Britney make sure the big end goes to the bottom The small end goes to the top Remember your angles too 45 and these to Brandi and I ll be right back Brandi Here How do I make this one work Oh this one is kind of fun This one quite literally is something you d finish off like if you re making grass you just kind of swirl it around You can do it like this Yeah there are two lines Like if you wanted to do ziggy zags You can do circles You know like that It s all about your pressure Oh What happened What happened They re laughing at my rose What s wrong with it That s a good start Keep building on it Now remember Leticia this big part right here on this side that goes down There you go If it s not in the right location You may want to unscrew this and realign this Try that see if that works better for ya Then remember you re twisting all at the same time You re making like upside down U s remember Oh you did miss that part of the lesson too didn t you All right let me show you and then I ll let you do one okay What you re gonna do this big one always goes down You re making like an upside down U Just like that You re gonna U and turn it all at the same time so that it s a slow turn and this motion all at the same time okay Then when you re done you just set that aside and do another one Show me what you re doing There you go Hold it just like that That s good Hey you re getting there You re making a pyramid of frosting and you can do it one of two ways You can either do it this way or straight up and down Just make a big glob of frosting and turn this all at the same time There you go just like that Pull your frosting off there you go Okay now that s a good start and now you re gonna start making your upside down U s Usually you have three on your bottom layer There you go You re turning it all at the same time It s all about the hand motion there you go just like that Just make little tiny ones all around There ya go that looks good There ya go See you can do this Leticia There oh look how beautiful that is It is Oh my gosh That s a perfect rosebud Thank you That s it That s all you have to do The bigger you wanna make your rose the more levels you put around the outside edge okay If that s all you want then pull it off set it aside and do some more That s it All right you ve got the techniques and you know what to do I ll come back and check on you Yes Yes yes yes Oh come on show me Show me show me At least it s better than theirs Hey you re getting there I think you re doing the same thing that Leticia was doing See this big piece You ve got it back It needs to go down If this is awkward for you and you need to twist this part of it Just unscrew and re navigate Britney that looks good Wait it is on bottom now It is now because I just turned it When you were doing it it wasn t See how these are heavy on top That s the reason It ll be okay Do you need some more Is there anymore cut out things No but there s stuff to do it All right I ll come back and check on you Sierra I m gonna leave you in charge over here If they need some help let me know okay Okay Good job Where are you over here Yes Yes yes yes Star borders deluxe Okay so how are you doing You re doing really good on those leaf tips Have you tried any standing up So you know how to do that Literally you start here and you pull straight up on it at a 90 degree angle What Just like that Like that sometimes they roll over The stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they are See how you can get them to stand up Just like that or if you want them to lay on the side If you go slow they stay up faster Yeah and it has to do with the consistency of your frosting too Remember what you put in it to make it a little bit thicker Powdered sugar Or you can do what There you go Sarah Sarah I have never seen Don t look A big no no Oh man that s good frosting Okay all right yell at me I stuck my thumb in it I had to lick it off It s really good by the way It is Don t do as I do do as I say That s kind of like momma s say Ya know I m your school momma It s not monkey see monkey do It s monkey do what monkey say I m telling ya today it s Ms Morris is doing something silly All right so Sarah show me another one Show me some shell borders cause I know you ve practiced those She will she ll be I ll be back That s cute That s very stylish Now the tip that Ashley has the one that looks like the little grass that s got the two holes at the same time If you re gonna do something real fancy if you ll do this one white and then put a colored one in there and do it back and forth it will kinda look like this Holly try it again Try again Where s the leaf Leddy s got one of them Do you guys have one Okay show her what to do It s pressure and release Pressure and release That one actually turned out really good That one is a very good leaf When you re working on your leaves for your cake this is what you want it to look like If they start breaking off like this you ll probably want to scrape them off It s just a matter of the pressure and release thing But those are looking really really good I know I m gonna sneeze too Okay maybe I m not Bless you Hey Mariah Show me what you can do Oh come on Those are good ones Those are cute That s a cute border Samantha you re doing a really good job on that too Kailyn that is awesome So have you practiced at home yet No Why not I figured you would be I figured you would be practicing every chance you got No I don t have time What do you mean you don t have time Yeah Drew told me you re working on your scrapbook Good job Brandi All right show me something that you can do I wanna see somebody make a rose I showed you how now I wanna see them Yes I wanna see you make a rose Make another one Oh Let me You can use my frosting I ll bring you some Look you did it So what is the rule 
 Where do I have more potential energy at position A or position B Matt Position A Why Because it s fully stopped before it s there it s already moving a little bit What else Why does this point here point A have more potential energy than point B So this is A this is B Does everyone agree that position A has more potential energy Raise your hand if you agree with that Okay Now who can tell me why why does position A have more potential energy than position B It has more potential to do work Why has potential to do work yes why It has a greater height It has a greater height Who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class I did Okay so going back to GPE When you have a pendulum swinging back and forth types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy and potential energy specifically We can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy If you focus your attention here What is that A pendulum A pendulum Similar to what you have here Actually you guys within the next week you ll actually be working with the simulation it s effect simulation they re online They re free for you to use and they re nice because they allow you to play I know you like to a play a lot I like to play Yes Matt You will be working with this but I just wanted to show you another application of this just in a different format When we swing the pendulum what s going to happen It s gonna move It s going to move and at point here And here let s say A and B what type of energy is being represented Potential Potential energy Who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented You wanna come up Sure Between A and B So every place along the path between A and B Does everyone agree with Ali Yes Yes okay Where is gravitational potential energy at its max Wanna go up and point At points A and B Right so everyone agree on the two ends Where would kinetic energy be at its max Where is kinetic energy at its max Right here Why Because it s lowest What else So we said here let s label this point C we already used A and B Why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here That s when the potential energy is at its lowest Great that s where potential energy the gravitational potential energy is at its lowest And if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula what does the formula state What variables involved in the kinetic energy formula Matt Mass and velocity Mass and velocity What can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it s swinging along its path back and forth from A to B What can we infer about the kinetic energy It s terminal velocity is Well we re not gonna say terminal velocity the object isn t falling it s attached What can we conclude about the velocity at point C any thoughts Garrett Greatest It s at its greatest When the pendulum is at this point it stops at each point A and B our two end points it stops for a split second because it has to do what Maddy did you say it Turn around It has to turn around When it swings back down what s happening to the velocity Is it increasing or decreasing Increasing so if the velocity is increasing what s gonna happen to the kinetic energy value It s also going to increase Now if I show you a graphical representation Who can describe the graphical representation Like a downward Okay Ali As it moves I guess it swings back and forth the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point it s the highest and then when it reaches points A and B the potential energy gets highest So does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with Yes Yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy I can stop it at certain areas Sometimes it comes out better than others It is somewhat on its way back but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy And if I m really good I can maybe try and get it in the middle Close enough it s hard to stop it right in the center But you notice that the potential energy does what Decreases and your kinetic energy will Increase Increase rather And you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point C One other factor that s involved here There is one other type of energy or form of energy that s involved can anyone think of it Celini Thermal Thermal energy Mechanical Mechanical Thermal Thermal Garrett you had your hand up Thermal Thermal Who agrees with thermal Raise your hand Wait actually no Is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum No That s mechanical Thermal If you re saying thermal energy what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum What is the pendulum doing right now It s moving through the Air Air When objects move through the air what can occur Or what is present Air resistance which is a form of Friction Friction Is or is not friction an example of heat energy Is Or thermal energy Yes so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present Yes Yes Now how come it s not showing up on the graph There s no friction There s no friction So what I like about this and like I said you guys will be using the simulation And one of the options you have is to change the value for friction Right now I have no friction so it s not showing up on the grid So if I increase the friction you re going to see how the value for thermal energy will change Also when you apply or work with the simulation you can actually change the mass of the ball or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself And those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days So let s add some friction Let s go about halfway What s happening to the friction It s increasing It s increasing on every swing It s increasing with every swing And the pendulum is not reaching points A and B anymore And the what It s not reaching points A and B anymore Why what s happening here we have all these types of forms of energy what s happening The air resistance slowing it down The air resistance could be slowing it down Want a little more Falls away Lots of friction and what s gonna happen Ali Losing particles It s not losing particles I m not losing any mass We re not changing the mass we re not changing the particles if there s a great deal of friction It s losing energy It slows down Does it lose energy How many of you think it loses energy Raise your hand How many of you think otherwise What happens to the energy that was present We had colorful bars Matt said it s colorful We had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy Now we have these great big red bars representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now What happened in this simulation Ali I don t know that but because in the definition of thermal energy that s the total potential or kinetic energy in an object So there is potential and kinetic energy involved yes Steven you wanna try and help him out The energy gets transferred to thermal Exactly the energy gets transferred to thermal energy What does the word transfer mean Or transform what does that mean You know the movie Transformers You guys are not too young for that right I had a Transformer I did Jessica It changes It changes If we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened what could we say that we learned about the energies involved What would be the main concept the thing you just learned which Steven and Jessica proceeded What happened to the energies who can restate what they just stated Matt Or maybe give a definition Energy is Transferred but not lost Okay energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost So what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy Would you agree with that statement Raise your hand if you agree And what does the word transform mean Bella Change Good change So you changed We began with what kind of energy at this position Elaine Potential Potential Ailsa it changed to Kinetic Kinetic it changed to Potential Potential Changed back to Kinetic Kinetic and we also have some thermal energy involved Is everyone clear on that concept What you re going to do with your group get out a sheet of paper a piece of scrap paper Or you could use the back of your packet is fine there s a blank spot on there One paper Per group Per group Okay what you re going to do I m showing you two objects I brought in props for you guys today Real life this is my toaster from home Aw Is it a brave little toaster What I want you to do you have two examples Stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in it is turned on the blades are moving What I want you to do to these two objects I want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects but what I want you to do is take it a step further I want you to tell me or place in order what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed So you begin with you might have a thought what type of energy do I begin with in order for the toaster to work What type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on And I want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation You re gonna get about two to three minutes to do this I would like every person in the group to participate You all should be able to share your ideas freely Respect what other people are saying and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies Any questions before you begin Any questions Okay See it like stops here Like that s potential energy and Well if you look at the fan I purposely turned it on So the blades are doing what They re moving Are they doing work Yes Base your forms or types of energy on what you see The blades are moving it is turning okay If you want to list the energy you begin with put an arrow put the next form of energy put an arrow Put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that s involved with the two objects Is it turning right now Do you all agree on that I would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that Wait wait wouldn t they both be nuclear energy Nuclear energy Yes because it s Think about your definition of Here you put the energy for toaster I would write it down Sucked in I don t have the jolt in that look I don t have the toaster plugged in Don t burn yourself But let s look and observe Three of you do you feel anything Yes do you see all those little black pointy things when you put something in there and you turn it on I don t know what you call those things but they like The coil Yeah the coil yeah Yes they do That s how you generate the heat If you had the toast it would turn on How about in the oven coils inside what colors do they turn Orange They turn orange the same thing They turn orange So do you think that there s a form of energy involved here Yeah Magnetic That s right Oh But you discovered it on your own 
 Ah okay Okay Suri does this only happens in vinegar or can it happen in water Try it tomorrow We re going to experiment more with this okay This is can I have your attention up here again I m just trying to help you by sharing observations I hear when I go around the room Somebody had a question and I love questions They said does this happen when you put it in water the same way that it happens if you put it in vinegar because I have told you all it s vinegar If you have questions like that could you please write them on the side so that I know what investigations you d like to do in the future So we can because we re going to be continuing this Now once you ve made all of your observations you still have that column like we ve had from every little activity today that says what could be happening So let me be more specific I want you to tell me again the title of the lab is where s the matter I want you to tell me where that tablet went I want you to look at your observations I want you to be specific And I want you to tell me where s the matter What happened to the tablet Okay in that last column you should only have one box to fill in Please discuss it with your lab group and write down where it went What happened to it And then we ll all discuss it together It can do both can t it So you think it turned into a gas You think it dissolved and turned into a gas okay so you can absolutely write both Next thing we re going to talk about is how we prove that So if any of you guys have a really quick idea think about how you can do an experiment Okay so keep thinking along those lines because you re going to design your experiment for it okay I have balloons I see the word dissolves I saw the word fizzy and escape Okay Alright I m going to write down some of these words that I m seeing I saw dissolved I know I saw escaped Fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped but thank you for reminding me Did you have fizzy separately Yeah Oh okay On your observation sight or what could happen Yeah what could happen What could happen okay Blended okay I had gas You had chemical reaction Bubbles Did I pretty much get the kinds of things you think may have happened Any any totally different ideas that you think happened You think it was still It became carbon dioxide Okay alright Alright focus up here then Good I see the same mixture When I did the first demonstration first thing you said was magic Then someone said chemical reaction Dissolved disappeared changed neutralized I see the same combination of words Dissolved escaped fizzy blended vanished chemical reaction magic I just see a little different priority okay Now I m a scientist I can t really test magic Can t really test if something was magic What I can test are the science type words I can test chemical reaction I can test blended I can sort of test fizzy Escaped dissolved These I can test I can try to figure out a way to determine whether the tablet dissolved or escaped Or a combination of both I can figure out if it being fizzy had something to do with it I can figure out if it was blended in I can figure out if it was a chemical reaction or I can let you do this And that s what I m going to do On your other half sheet you should have another half sheet on your table First thing I need you to do is in your group I need you to come to a consensus That means you guys have got to agree The first question on there says okay where s the disappearing matter But I asked you to think about it in terms of everything you ve seen today I magically changed clear liquid into pink liquid and then pink liquid back into clear liquid again You saw a candle magically get shorter and the wick magically disappearing and some black stuff come out of nowhere and you saw an alka seltzer tablet vanish Okay So your group needs to agree on an overall theory Where s the disappearing matter I want you to discuss it and I want you all to write the exact same sentence for where s the disappearing matter at the top of your paper Okay so you have to agree There was a small piece that I put in right now and the alka seltzer went up So you know that it goes to the bottom not to the top Okay That s a great observation because its very specific I like it So you all need to talk about Okay so in every single experiment it turned into a gas So the pink liquid turned into a gas And the white liquid turned into a gas And when the clear liquid went pink liquid the wax turned into a gas I didn t even see it disappear Oh when you blew it out you saw smoke so when you blew it out the amount of smoke that went off do you think it was equal to the amount of candle that s missing Oh the liquid was a solid this is a gas so Tell me about the liquid again Because I only saw liquid so I keep If the pink was less dense than the white If the density explained it have you ever seen liquids that have different densities combined Have you ever seen oil in water Okay so what does it look like when you have two different density liquids Did you see layers with the Where d the pink stuff go Disappeared by itself Okay So these are the things you guys have to talk about You can t just take one person s you guys gotta make sure you all agree and it has to be an explanation that explains all three events that we saw today So when I say where s the disappearing matter you tell me it turned into a gas I m going to say okay then the pink liquid turned into a gas I didn t see bubbles Okay So it has to be a sentence that explains it all You guys aren t talking here Okay The disappearing matter is in the liquid So you still think the alka seltzer tablet is in there Okay so you think it s in there but it s now bubbles Okay It s in there but it s now bubbles so it changed in to bubbles and then what about the pink liquid and the clear liquid You think it s all still in there Okay but that time no bubbles but it s still in there Okay so candle Where did the rest of the wick go Is it still there Okay so you were good for two out of three but you can t say it s still in there for the candle so change your sentence Talk about it Change your sentence just a little bit I get that you re saying that Right But change your sentence a little bit so it applies to all three events Okay What s your sentence that everyone has agreed on That matter turns into So you had bubbles in your candle No Oh this is supposed to be to explain all three events we saw today Okay This is a good start but it has to be more general Where is the disappearing matter in general today Dissolved is good for this one Is this one dissolved Nope Okay so can you think of something dissolved and melted have in common so you can make it one sentence to explain everything Okay doesn t show up anymore does that mean it s gone Okay that s where you have to agree You have to agree whether it is gone or not Okay Okay stop for just one second I talked to a couple of really good groups but a couple of groups are very stuck because they disagree I told you you all had to agree and you had to explain all three things It s like the most difficult thing you can possibly do He won t listen to you I hear you Okay I m listening Here s the thing In the disagreements I ve seen the disagreement is is it gone or is it not gone Does that make sense Okay Did it go away Did it disappear or is it still in there That s the disagreement Now I have an idea What if we let s pick one experiment okay I think for this class the easiest experiment to deal with would be the tablet The alka seltzer and the vinegar okay Write that down on that half sheet as the experiment we chose The experiment we chose the alka seltzer We re going to choose that as a class What are the materials we put in The tablet and the vinegar Write those down on that left side It says materials we put in Do we put in anything else I didn t trick you I swear Okay so we had vinegar and we had a tablet What did you see come out Bubbles We ve got bubbles so write those on the right hand side We ve got bubbles Fizz He thinks he s saying he thinks the fizz is carbon dioxide That s fine We can call it whatever you want and what some kind of guess and what else Are you left with anything else You re still left with some liquid right Okay so write that down You re left with you ve got bubbles and you re left with bubbly liquid Here s what I think we need to prove We need to prove if what we put in is the same as what we got out How we can tell if something s there if we can t see it in science Okay you ve got bubbles What do you think Nick We weigh the vinegar and the alka seltzer tablet we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards and see of the number s the same 
 Tell them what you wrote Describe your three pictures and then they re going to share what they saw and the three pictures they picked The cat I picked the roller coaster Man What did you get for what I only did two I think the Earth Y all did the roller coaster Max is that possible Why not what did you write There s no gravity So in that picture he s weightless but where is he In front of a building So he s on a planet right Yeah So what should happen if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video He s falling He should fall right All right write that down next to that picture I don t mean to do that All right so let s look at the roller coaster He couldn t even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down so that s why why he wouldn t fall like that And that s either like strange stuff But I don t think he could fall like that Unless he He can t fall like that That s impossible Get his weight and Yeah exactly cause he can t do that Yeah cause you can see his shadow under that And don t think he I think he got like a hoop or something So like a little string or something Or like he fall Yeah cause he can t do that They must have took that while he was Cause that s impossible Earth s gravity pulling him like that Unless he in space or something All right so why would he fall Because the force of gravity pushing down So why would he fall that way and not fall that way The gravity would push him down and not up so There s like there s gravity on Earth so like if you consider like how Newton found the apple when it fell to the ground Okay so you know there s something going on that s pulling you down And you say What if you were on the other side of the Earth Would it be pulling you up then If you were on the other side Or would it still pull you down to the ground It would still pull you down to the ground All right so on the planet what can we say about gravity Where is it trying to pull you To the center Ah to the center so it doesn t matter where you stand it s not pulling you down it s just trying to pull you where To the center To the center okay All right one more minute for sharing Make sure you have three pictures described on your T chart If you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor do that now And you got the Solar System Okay so it says planets can move because of gravity Where are they moving around the sun And what has them go in a circle and not flying away All right who would like to share what they wrote with their group Their favorite one their favorite picture All right Arquel which one was your favorite picture The roller coaster Roller coaster who picked roller coaster All right so let s all look at the roller coaster And Arquel tell us what your team wrote down and Sarah will add it to our list We had put that the gravity brings the speed to the to the roller coaster So if you wanted to make the speed increase you would want to bring your hill higher So therefore the the speed will increase and it ll go faster All right so Arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster So if you want a faster roller coaster you need to build a higher roller coaster Did anybody write anything different for roller coaster Carlos what did you write Oh the same thing but the steepness of the hill when it s going down it increases its velocity and it s more G s All right so he says the steeper the hill more velocity more G s What s a G Let s have Carlos try first then we can help him out if he needs help What s a G You said G Yeah A G is a pull Okay so it s a pull Adriana you want to add to it It s a force pushing against you All right pushing against you Anybody else want to add to that It s a pull its a force it s pushing against you How do we get a G force What do you think Austin You have a push or pull you have excess friction air accelerates Push or pull excess friction Arquel All the forces together All the forces put together on you Okay So let s write G force down and put a question Cause we re still not sure what that is maybe we can get there So we re not sure quite what a G is But we know it has something to do with gravity All right let s pick another picture Who had a favorite picture that we haven t talked about that wasn t a roller coaster What was your favorite picture Greg The dude The dude who is the dude He has a name We know who that is Who is that Enrique Johnson It was Newton right What was Newton s first name Not John Isaac Issac there we go Issac Newton all right And what does the dude say Isaac Newton What s he saying What s his quote Not that dude this one Oh the floating dude Okay the floating dude He d rather talk about the floating dude above Isaac Newton Okay so let s look at the guy floating in the middle of the air He looks like he s planking Is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture No Greg why do you say this is impossible Because the Earth s gravitational pull right Okay so he says the Earth s gravitational pull what Like this wouldn t work because when you pull Okay he should be being pulled down to the center of the Earth Why do you say the center Cause that s where the gravitational pull s coming from Cause that s where all the gravity wants to take you and that s where all the gravity s coming from I like that answer Anybody want to add to it Vanessa But if you have pressure against both forces you could possibly stay up longer Okay so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer Chloe Force Where would that force come from Your body So how could he if he s not touching the ground make himself float What s underneath you that you don t see Gravity Well we don t see gravity but what s underneath him It s around us right now Air The air right So let s think about the air If we could make the air thicker what would we also increase The gravity Not the gravity we re trying to go against the force of gravity The weight The force against our weight What s that called let s think about a boat Floating in the water Bouyance Bouyant force right So if you could increase the bouyant force of the air and Vanessa said if you could make that strong enough you should be able to float Does anyone know a planet where there s more thick clouds than we have here It s our neighbor Mars He has clouds Who has clouds who has thick clouds Jarissa Venus Venus Yeah is that what you were going to say Venus has super thick clouds right And if we could go there maybe there d be enough air underneath you that you could float in the air If they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body okay All right anymore for the floating guy Did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air I know that Karima and Anthony had a good answer What did you guys write down Anthony Put that I put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the Earth and it will like Like it would It pulls you to the center of the Earth and what did we decide about where you stand on Earth Like on the other side So what would happen if you went to the other side of the Earth Would it still pull you the same way Or is it going to pull you an opposite way The same way The same way where is it always going to pull you Down Towards the center To the center to the middle okay It doesn t matter what planet you stand on doesn t matter where you are it s trying to take you to the center of the object okay So why do we get stuck to the Earth and that the Earth s stuck to us in this picture Cause the Earth s solid and it doesn t let us go out into the Okay so he said the Earth is solid Are we solid Yes Hmm okay so maybe it s not that we re solid cause maybe there s something else going on What do you think Carlos The Earth has more mass than us The Earth has more mass than us Jenny what s mass Mass is well all of us then We all have it How would you give a definition of mass what is it about us The type of weight It s the type of weight Okay we re on the right track Who wants to help her out What s mass The amount of density Amount of density Okay we re getting better Jarissa The amount of space that it takes Well what would that be what s your space Volume okay So space is volume We re still trying to figure out what s mass We ve heard some density words we ve heard volume words what do you think Ky The amount of electrons Oh we re getting closer So it s your electrons your Atoms Ah your atoms So it s how many atoms you have inside your body That s your mass So now someone else said weight so let s go back to that How do you get weight So you stand on the scale How do you know your weight What is going on What do you think Hakeem Pounds We measure it in pounds Okay so how do me measure it How do you get pounds What s happening to your mass What happens when you stand on the scale What is it measuring Your weight Your weight So then how do we figure that out What s going on What s going on on a scale Carlos The gravity is pushing you down Gravity is pushing you down So what happens to your weight if you have more mass You re heavier You re heavier So your weight how would we give a description of weight now We know mass is how many atoms you have We know volume is how much space you take up So now what s weight Carlos has kind of said it for us How would we put it as a definition It s the pull of what on your mass Gravity Pull of gravity So let s look at the guy in the picture again If this was going to be true what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float Would he be allowed to have a mass on Earth Hakeem says no Vanessa says yes If you re going to float and there s gravity always trying to pull you down in order to float what do we have to do With our mass Decrease our mass okay So let s think about if we go to another planet with our weight Does your mass change if you go to another planet Yes no Do all of a sudden you have more atoms in you No Depending on the gravity What did you say You have the same atoms but your weight and mass changes You said the same amount of atoms so your weight and mass changes But if you have the same amount of atoms isn t your mass the same Yeah Okay so what s the only thing that would change Jarissa The gravity The gravity so then what would that change about your weight Would it change or would it stay the same It would change It will change So what can we say if we went to a smaller planet You ll become lighter You ll become lighter Why Because it has less gravity Has less gravity so less pull You weight less okay So let s put weightless next to G force as another word we should look up Ready All right so what I want you to do now using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about I want you to flip your paper over And in the circle I would like you to try with your partner to write a definition for what you think gravity is I ll give you one minute You and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is and write that in your circle back Make sure you guys share that okay A lot of weight or What s the other word of how many atoms you have What s it pulling on Very good so it pulls on your mass And think about where it s trying to pull Oh that s a good definition of gravity try to write your definition on your paper Make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper Pulls what Pulls the Weight You almost said it Mass Mass Make sure you guys share that okay You guys done Okay so what is gravity It s a force so that means it s a what A A short pull Gravity s pulling us right Okay so what s so what do you think is it pushing or pulling Pushing Pulling Ooh we have a disagreement Better figure out which ones right Okay so it s a pull So where is it trying to take you to And what is it trying to take about Your Your definition All right what are you having I wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center Okay so the word I want you to make sure we say is invisible Cause we ll talk about that okay All right so let s share our definitions Who would like to share their definition first All right Ky We put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle All right Gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle So Sarah can you add that to the circle Arquel what did you guys write Gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the Earth and it wants to the mass Okay so you added mass to that Okay so it s pulling on mass What do you want to add Angel I want to add to Kyle s answer that it s invisible Invisible So let s think about what we learned about forces If it s invisible you can t see it Is it touching you Yes Or is it everywhere It s everywhere Everywhere So is it a contact force or a non contact force Non contact Why do you say that Israel Because it s not touching you It s not touching you So even if you re floating in outer space will gravity still be there Yes What do you think Carlos Yes You say yes So those astronauts will they still feel some gravity Even though they re out at the space station What do you think Angel Outer space has some gravity but greater than that s why they wouldn t feel it What do you think it depends on We have mass so far But the strength of gravity also depends on something else We have mass but what could it also depend on Vanessa Force Okay gravity is a force Angel was getting there he was saying that it s still pulling on you it s just not as strong The weight That s mass We talked about mass and weight Trying to get the other thing that s going to control gravity How big the planet is Okay so that s mass Let s think about the astronauts who are not as close to the Earth Are they weightless They have the same amount of mass their mass didn t change But they went farther away from the Earth So why are they weightless Why do they float What s the other factor going on with gravity Moving away from the center of the Earth So what do we call that Has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on We have mass and we re looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity What do you guys think If I m really far away from Jarissa am I able to grab her as much as if I was closer No If I go real close to her is it easier for me to pull on her Yes But what happens if I go far away I have the same mass my mass doesn t change can I reach her as easily now No So what s the other thing going on with gravity Distance Distance So if you re far away from the Earth can gravity pull on you as hard No No But the closer you get the little bit stronger little bit stronger So then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on Earth but I don t feel the Sun We re closer to the Earth than we are the Sun So we re going to feel the Earth before we would feel the Sun But now if we left the planet we started going somewhere else say I was going to Mars What would happen the closer I got to Mars Who would start pulling me now Mars The Mars center of its planet would start to pull me Okay So let s look at the picture of the planets Thinking about pulling to the center why in the picture of the planets is the Sun in the middle of all the planets Because it s the biggest Oh it s the biggest one We got a couple of different answers so let s share with our neighbor first See if you know why the sun is in the center You got 30 seconds It s got the biggest mass It got the biggest mass and it s the biggest So like it got the most gravitational pull That s why it s in the middle All right Marco Why do you think the Sun is in the center of our solar system Because I don t know You don t know Okay Javier what do you think You re his partner what did you guys talk about Based on what we just talked about why would the Sun go in the center It has more mass It has more mass So what does it also have more Gravity So he s always going to be in the middle right What if we had a bigger star come our way Like what about a black hole Say one of our neighbors blew up One of our 
 Get out your journal I ll read it aloud and I ll put the time on the timer Get our your journal We re looking at journal entry number 14 And you re not allowed to write I don t know take a guess if you re not sure but don t write I don t know So question 14 is very simple Why do you think an earthquake happens You can write it you can draw a picture So I m asking you why do you think an earthquake happens You have three minutes right now to write what you think Why do you think an earthquake happens Why do you think an earthquake happens and why do you think Remember there s no right or wrong it s what you think is the answer Remember you can draw a picture if that helps you Okay if you want to draw alright you ve got like a minute left so you can draw a picture Write down what you think I m gonna give you about 30 more seconds Many of you are still writing and that s fine but I thought before we talk about this let s take a look at a little clip because I realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake So this one s kinda cool It was shot obviously on somebody s iPhone so it s not the best quality but many of you know that Japan has lots of earthquakes all the time they re very used to earthquakes So this person lives in Japan and so again they re used to earthquakes right So they weren t like panicking so he actually took his iPhone and filmed the ground So I want you to take a look We re only gonna look at about a minute of it but I want you to notice how the ground is moving okay And we re gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen So this is pretty cool So this was back in March 2011 So notice Now they re gonna go to another part Notice the ground in the back watch the back You ll see something happen Watch what s happening Alright so that s real it s not like there was a machine underneath there doing that So you guys we can solve what s happening so let s take that and let s talk about this through Why do you think an earthquake happens Why do you guys think an earthquake happens And remember when we talk we re gonna let one person go at a time and we re gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear Alright so let s just start on this side We re gonna work this way Tony what did you write Why do you think an earthquake happens Well I think there s something wrong with the mantle that s coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake Okay something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate Also I liked how you used a complete sentence So remember if you re not sure there s some sentence starters up there Jheyline what did you write I think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other Excellent because plate boundaries overlap each other Jose I think that earthquakes happen when plates crash When plates crash Together Anybody else Adrian and then Dajana I think that earthquakes happen because plates slide Because plates slide excellent Dajana I think an earthquake happens from too much stress Also I think the plate boundaries overlap Ooh I like what you said and that s exactly where I m going next So in that video clip you guys saw the ground move I m gonna give you 10 seconds And that 10 seconds you re gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move What direction was that ground moving So you have 10 seconds share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you Go 10 seconds Alright finishing up in five four three two one zero Okay so I heard lots of people talking so I m gonna pull a name this time remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said So what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip Let s see Now Neferly what kind of movement did you see They were moving apart Good moving apart what else did you notice Angel They were moving apart Moving apart what else did you notice Dajana Well it was crashing everywhere but I saw the Ooh kind of like water coming out of the sky Josh what else did you notice Oh so a little bit of up and down movement Alright so up and down movement Anybody else notice any other type of movement So you guys said up and down you said moving apart Oh did you see how that piece literally slid Yeah Alright so that s movement You guys know some words for this What are some words that we ve learned to describe movement and Dajana said a couple What words Jina Shearing Yes so there was some shearing happening What else was happening Rodolfo Tension Yes some tension pulling apart And what else did you notice Daniel Compression Yeah compression squeezing together Okay so we re getting this idea that didn t Dajana you said it was stress or you said stress Dajana right So something about stress being kind of important So we re gonna take that idea Give us a moment okay thanks Alright so sorry about the interruption So stress Dajana was saying stress So let me give you an example So let s imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band Let s imagine that it s a rock And let s imagine it s a rock I know it s a rubber band but let s imagine it s a rock So I m gonna take I m gonna go like this it s a rock remember So I m doing this to the rock and then I m gonna stand here for an entire year and then a year from now I m gonna put my hands further apart And then another year I m gonna put my hands further apart What s happening to this rock or this rubber band What s happening to this rock over time What s happening Lupita to this rock It s stretching It s stretching what else Add to that Tucker and stretching it out stretch is added to it Stress is added too nice Victor So maybe it s getting a little compression Okay maybe a little compression too My hands are getting tired Tony Continental drift Ooh like okay so if there were other pieces like my hands were Africa and South America they d be moving apart Ernesto Thinner in the middle Thinner in the middle Sakura Tension So tension now I m gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt but what would happen if I kept doing that I m gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you What might happen if I kept doing that and I kept doing that and I kept doing that What might happen to this rubber band or this rock So 10 seconds to the person next to you ten seconds Alright finishing up in five four three two one zero Okay I heard lots of good discussion So if I kept doing this I kept doing it I kept doing it Moses what might happen It might crack and break It might crack and break Everyone what else maybe might happen Victor It will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it ll break Ooh oh I like cause you remember this a lot right Little earthquake excellent Tucker It s just like when you shove your fingers go all the way back it will break Oh yeah that would be painful Jheyline It d probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything Did everybody hear that word she just said Which word did you say it would Explode Explode wow That s a big powerful word but that s pretty equal to what happened right Big amount of power Or like when you were doing that with the rock like when you were moving it like it would get more thinner and get more it would kinda get wider when after all while it s still going it s gonna like Good so let s step back a little bit So who was it someone had said earthquake right You had said earthquake So it s sounding like what if that happens first So before the earth actually moves before what we saw in the video what did you guys think was happening And Moses had used the word for it too What was happening to the rocks over time So over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake What s happening over time Ernesto what s happening over time It s stretching It s stretching keep going with that Diego It was standing It was standing Tony It s spreading apart Spreading apart Jheyline Widening Widening Tiger Breaking Breaking so wait before the breaking though you guys were saying it was stretching it was pulling so what word can you describe it building up in here building up Stephanie Through stress Ah okay so it sounds like if we re gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first We have said stress that builds right Stress builds and then what s gonna happen when the stress builds and it builds and it builds and it builds and it can t take it anymore What s going to happen Manuel Collide This is stress keep going Not collide what s another word that s kind of same idea So you said it when I was over here It s gonna keep stressing and stressing and what s gonna happen to the rock Rip It ll what Rip Rip what s another word you can say It ll explode Explode Adrian Break Break great so there s going to be a rupture Or a break And then is that it End of the story Nice day that s it Where does all this energy go right There s all this energy building up where does it go Yeah it ruptures it breaks and then is it over No No what where what happened Where did the energy go Where did that energy go Irma where d it go Plate tectonics Yeah it has to do with plate tectonics absolutely Where did that energy go Where did it go Rodolfo Plate boundaries Yeah plate boundaries So okay we got stress builds ruptures it breaks and then is that it No That s the earthquake What action Yeah Anna It becomes an earthquake Yeah it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience Jheyline Shaking Shaking oh So it sounds like there s a rupture or a break and then that s gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released An earthquake It s an earthquake yes and what is that shaking actually being released So the shaking is released what Victor All the stress Yes it s releasing all the stress What s another word you could say Releasing all of its Power Power is a good word or Diego Energy Energy right So it seems like all an earthquake is is stress building up building up building up breaks and then we feel that What do we experience the energy as So what do we experience think of the energy as What do we experience it as an energy That That what s that Shaking Shaking right Alright awesome So now we re gonna you guys did that perfectly So we re gonna write that down in our notes Woah I know that earthquakes release energy right So that s what happens as a result So we are not in any way done with this because we are gonna talk all about different You guys have made a good start on what s happening So we are gonna take two notes today They re pretty short I m sorry the first one s a little long The other one s super short But this is what you guys were just telling me except now we re gonna add the word elastic strain which is what you guys were telling me You were telling me that energy was building up you were telling me stress was building up and that s gonna cause elastic strain Yes Dajana The pictures that you showed us What It only cut through the Kind of yeah Yes So like maybe cause on the bottom that came out of the ground Yeah And then it just spilled it over then it came out of the ground Yeah so thank you for those of you who got started Rodolfo let me just read this off for people So our first topic today is earthquake energy And this is what we just talked about But now we re getting a chance to write it down and we re adding in a bigger word And that word is elastic strain So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape Okay so that s step one in an earthquake Step two Energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves and we will learn all about those next week But you can still write down you just think released energy travels and it s felt as shaking 
 What are his tools Is that your hose Awesome Now what needs to come out of the hose to put out the fire Water Yeah What color is it Miley is helping you out Look there Good water What do you do with that thing Marissa What s the doctor going to do with that I can t hear you What You re right Listen to your heart Very good Do you remember what we call that Not a telescope a stethoscope There you go All right Miley what does your teacher need What tools A smart board A smart board Are you going to draw the smart board All right Are you finished with your fireman Did you hear Miley Do you need to draw anything else for your fireman or is he all good I don t know where the fire is You re the artist where s his fire It s your fire Marissa what is that bag for The doctor bag The doctor bag I love it What did you draw What is that Very good And what do you do with the stethoscope Check your heart A whole bunch of fire Well I m glad you re the fireman and you re going to put it out I love it There you go Good job That is one colorful nurse I see it It s great You re almost finished What is that orange thing It goes your mouth and what does it do Do you remember It takes your temperature It s a thermometer Good job What are you going to teach your kids right there Good job What about the kids She s on the smart board right now Very good All right just a few more minutes We have to finish up so you all can stickers A B C D E F G H I You did draw the shot You re done All right You may go Give me five Great job I love your fireman A B C D E F G H J J I love how nice you folded that Anthony Good job Good job are you all finished I love it I love it Good job I love your teacher She s very happy What are you going to do in art Make me a picture Can t wait What is this A stair bridge Wow Who s going to use it I love it Who has an airplane What s the person I m a teacher I teach kids Who flies the airplane Ask Aaron see if he can help you out Do you remember Aaron can you help him out Who flies the plane What s his name The pilot Yeah The pilot Good job Mary What are you You re not the firefighter What are you Who s uniform do you have on The cop The cop s Very good You re going to arrest people Why They re speeding Watch out Aaron Mary s going to catch some speeders He s arrested He s arrested What was he doing Speeding Speeding Oh no Look what happens when you speed You crash And who s going to come rescue you Who will come help you if you crash The policeman and who s going to help you get better Who did you see yesterday Who came to visit us yesterday Do you remember We went out and got to sit inside of it Ambulance Good job What s going on over here You re what Tacos How many Two Thank you Are they for me This is my cake Your cake Okay What are you going to do with your cake after you mix it up A chocolate cake Oh no It just came out of the oven It just came out of the oven It looks great Is there a special occasion for your cake All right That would be great I ll make sure nobody touches your cake It s fine It ll stay right there What are you going to make Cookie dough What kind You don t know Put your hands up she said You put it in the oven How long do you cook it Five minutes or five hours Five minutes Good job Oh no it fell I think you re doing a good job but I think you have it crooked Hang on That s an awesome cookie Thank you Great job What do you tell her What do you say Thank you Thank you You re working hard You almost have it Cross it Good job Great job helping Awesome I don t know where the lid is for this Did you ask Dylan if he s the one that had it out Dylan do you know where the lid is for the Well then you need to help her Show her where it s at She wasn t sure Thank you Oh hang on a second N O Is that an R No No Let s fix it R S Help him out Dylan what s after S All right There you go What s next There s your P Q R S V Then what What s going on over here You re giving him a shot Why are you giving him a shot What happened to him What happened to him that he needs a shot He s sick Did it hurt What was in that shot What was in the shot The needle The needle but what came out of it It was just in his hand So what did you give him Yeah medicine What are you listening to Your heart My heart Am I okay Now I m about to give you a haircut A haircut All right Julius don t run All right So how do you like your job nurse Good I see why you made your picture all different colors Your nurse uniform is all different colors Good job I think your next appointment is here Have a seat she can check you out Leave the chair right there That s a shot too There s a different shot Yes I m scared Ow Shots hurt Ow I think you only need one What did you just give me Medicine Medicine Is that my Band Aid 
 And I m going to look at what number that is and I see that that is Now your information that you get we re going to be writing in our chart here So do you see at the bottom of your page it has ramp with one book you re going to write the distance that your car moved Now don t write 20 inches cause yours is going to be different okay You write how far your car went for ramp number one Okay Hold on just a second Isabelle Now I gave you guys numbers And the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment The number one person is going to set up the ramp So they re going to put the dictionary and the ramp get it all set up for the group The number two person is going to get to hold the car and let it go okay And then the number three person is going to measure the distance that it went okay Close attention Okay so you re going to all have a job to do Now this is with the one dictionary When we do the experiment next we re going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes okay But for right now we re going to try just one dictionary Are there any questions before we get started Miguel Like the first one goes first and then on the second thing like you try to set the number one does the second job and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job Yes so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment okay So we don t need to fight over who gets to do the car and who can get that okay Isabelle question But what if we do the same each of us what we do Oh if that s what you get if you get 20 inches on yours then you write that down okay Yes Angie When you took No we re all going to talk to each other in nice friendly voices that s right Okay Max last question and then we need to get started Are we going to use the rulers Yes you re going to use the rulers And I know I didn t give those to the groups but I m going to pass those out right now okay Can I have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group Who s going to set up the ramp Me Okay you re number two Start it in the corner It s a meter Come on over here Okay get your paper No but watch out Don t do it Awesome Okay boys and girls once you get to your group you can go ahead and get started It looks farther And this group you may use this ruler Okay measure it One right here and then here Are you okay No from here From there there No Ms Sprano said from here Nine inches No 11 11 11 inches It looks like eight Wait is oh no it s eight Remember what Ms Sprano said No she said from the front Actually I said from the back Good listening Miguel So how far did the car go Eight inches Eight inches okay excellent So write down your information You ve got a pencil right here Okay so the next step Isabelle Miguel and Angie Is you re going to try it with two dictionaries Okay But number three is going to set it up Look up at the chart to see who s going to set it up So who s setting it up Um number two Okay let s figure it out Okay now go to your group for a second Okay now is this how far going to Yea till we go Well wait a second are we measuring from the top of the ramp or are we measuring from the bottom So you re going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp and then measure to the end of the car So how far did that car go Five No it s to the end of the car So how far did the car go Two Two inches Now do you guys think that because you re on a thicker carpet that s going to change your results It should go up like that Do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far Yes Yeah Would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet Yeah Okay you can move to that carpet and see what the difference is And you guys will have to share that with the class okay So try it again with just one dictionary okay So then one Have to let the car go guys We re going to try it with two dictionaries Okay so look at the chart to see who s going to set it up next Oh my God this is going to be loud We re good Ms Sprano She said from the very back You set it up No I mean you let go Who s turn is it You re doing the first one Who s number three We all have jobs to do Who s number one Okay so your job is to set up the ramp which you did a good job on Number two person who s the number two person So Giselle I m number three No she was two It s fine she s number three So Giselle you re going to let the car go and look Esmeralda is going to measure Okay so Excellent Okay now put that down Now which side do we need to start with Very good And then we can spin it around there So now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet Can you scoot it over some Very good so how far did the car go Seven inches good Okay so let s write that down on our chart Finish yours Change this so it s seven inches Okay now what s our next step what are we going to do next I don t know Are we going to try it with two dictionaries Okay so now who s going to set that up Looks like the number two person so Giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary so put one more dictionary on top Okay good Well number three is going to let the car go So now it s Esmeralda s turn So you guys what do you think is going to happen Do you think it s going to go farther or do you think it s going to be closer When you let go of the car right now what do you think is going to happen You think it ll fall down Okay well let s see what happens Woah did you see how far that went Okay don t pick it Now wait a second it s Edgar s turn to measure So let s see how far did it go Edgar So we measure to the 14 Wow that went farther didn t it So your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries Please go sit down in your group and raise your hand Let s go sit down at our group The car s there 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half Who knows how to write 15 and a half So number two would get to measure the distance on this one okay Okay so let me see how you re doing here Okay well can we try it again Can we try it again So you re on the second experiment So number three who s the number three person He is Jose s the number three person Okay so Jose get s to let it go Should we move this out of the way or should we keep it here So are you number three No I m number one but number one set it up But then see Oh Okay so it looks like it s Jose s turn to let the car go So hand the car No he sets up ramp Can you go sit down please and I ll be right with you Got it Okay Jose try it It s my car put it right here and let s see what happens Okay let go Excellent okay who s measuring Me Okay so let s measure Now do we want it are we measuring with inches or centimeters No it s right we re doing it the right way Don t worry Did it go farther or was it closer Okay so then I have a question for you guys listen If we put three dictionaries here do you think it s going to go farther or it s going to go closer Farther You think it s going to be farther What do you think Jose Farther What do you think Farther Well okay we better check it out Did you write down your numbers So for the second one it was 15 inches Okay Now we re on the last part that means the number three person sets up the ramp Are you the number three person So set up the ramp where s your other dictionary Okay so then we have to use the dictionary okay Can you let go Okay it s oh wow that might be pretty cool huh Okay so Devon it s your turn to let the car go And I like how you re moving all the stuff out of the way Selena you want to stay there or do you want to move Oh okay So who s turn is it to measure Again No number one gets to You know what I think we mixed it up Now Selena lets go of the car And Devon measures this time okay Did you okay so maybe it s Jose s turn Okay go ahead Ooh look how much it turned Okay so measure how far it went Okay so measure how far it went let s see what happened Do we move the 17 Try it again let s try it again Okay let s see how are you guys doing You got all yours finished Okay good Okay well I haven t gone over that Okay boys and girls raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments All three Okay 
 boys and girls for the last week we have been looking at videos about Dr Martin Luther King We ve been reading books about Dr Martin Luther King to get a feel for who he was why people loved him so much why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did So today we are going to watch another clip of Dr Martin Luther King This is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave It was his I Have a Dream speech I don t want you to so much listen to his words today as I want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he s speaking that makes him such a great speaker How does he capture his audience How does he get people to want to listen to him Alright So I want you to pay close attention It s just a short clip Then you ll turn to your partners So let s see Let me go ahead and get this started I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers I have a dream today I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together This is our hope This is our hope and this is the faith that I go back to the South with With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope With this faith we will be able to Okay I m going to stop it there And I want you to tell me first of all what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience I want you to think about it for a minute I see lots of hands up What I want you to do is turn to your share partner first Talk to your partner about what you saw Okay Let me have your attention back up here I m going to write Dr King in the middle of this web What I want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what Dr King had to say Sara He had hand motions He had hand motions But there was no hand motions in that clip Yeah there was I m glad that you all saw that I almost said something You could kind of see this hand go up but it was so close The video was so close That s why I picked that particular segment because I saw his arm and I thought Oh I hope they get that because I couldn t find a better clip Zachary The way he said a few words at a time Okay He said words at a time and stopped Very good He spaced his words for lack of something a better term to use Zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on Annie Okay Emma He spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him Okay So his tone of voice right We ll put tone of voice So it was easy to hear him Yeah And then he didn t mumble He spoke up really loud He spoke loudly He did not mumble she said He spoke loudly He spoke very serious Yes He spoke very serious Jesenya He shook his head He shook his head didn t he He nodded Very good That was my idea He shook his head Or nodded Dalen He was looking at the audience Very good He was looking at the audience We call that eye contact He had notes in front of him but he didn t do this did he No He looked up constantly He might have looked down to see where he was in his speech but he always looked back at his audience Lenare He said nice words that the people knew Okay The words that he spoke he had a good message didn t he If you have a good message people are willing to listen to you too He was a good good man One more Kalen He even had a gooder life a better life Very good And that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke the good message about having a better life All right So you guys came up with some really good points right here What I want you to think about when you do your readers theater I want you to think about how you can incorporate what Dr Martin Luther King incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you re believable in your part that people can understand what you re saying So what we re going to do is we re going to create a rubric together that s going to help you So it s called Rubric For Speaking Out for Justice Dr Martin Luther King Jr a readers theater play grade two because you guys are second graders Now let s take a look at what I ve written listening speaking viewing There s a three a two and a one Let s do listening first okay Now if three is the highest how do you think you can get a three Sayid By getting a one plus two Okay But don t think about math right this moment Oh I want you to think about if I were grading you you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three Emma We start with listening You wouldn t be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around You d be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is You have to be ready Very good You have to know where your part is Part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it s your turn to speak okay So I was a good listener Let s look at number two How do you think you would get a two How would you score a two for listening If the best is that you were a good listener what would two be Annie Looking at your paper and then like doing something else Looking at your paper but doing something else Maybe looking away maybe fidgeting So maybe you tried to listen most of the time but you had difficulty with it So we could say I tried to listen most of the time Most of the time So what about a one Kennedy I didn t listen at all Very good Like purposefully not paying attention I forgot to listen Yeah you don t decide to do that on purpose Whitney Now the next thing you re going to be scored on is speaking So how could you get a three for speaking Sara Don t speak like just normal like how the actor would speak Speak how the actor would speak Good Lenore Let s do a body check please I need you all on the carpet You re supposed to like listen to what he said Okay Annie Like speak a little louder When you speak loudly then I spoke loudly enough for people to hear I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama will Will be Will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers My dad and I have that dream too When we let freedom ring we will let it rumble We will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city We will be able to see that day when all of God s children black men and white men Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spirit Free at last Free at last Thank God almighty We are free at last Dad when I listen to Reverend King I know that he s right I know that things are going to change I think you re right Act IV It is now spring of 1963 The speech of Reverend King has continued to lead people and speak out their He has met with another president Lyndon B Johnson and has seen changes sweep across the country May Billy please come in here I have some news What is it Mom Reverend King is dead He was shot in Memphis Tennessee No Mom That s not fair He was helping all of us I agree Billy It isn t fair But remember Reverend King lives on in us Every time we remember the words every time we speak out against things that are unfair we are giving remembrance Okay So go find the people that had your card and have your conversations get your feedback about how you did Miss Walters I got all three too Great Great Did you see me I had nine points You were a good listener Very good Great feedback 
 Starter stopper opposite side Okay Everybody has their marbles How many trials are we doing Five Five trials If the first one doesn t work raise your hand I will come help you and we ll talk about why it doesn t work and what we re gonna do to change it What you re gonna do to change it Okay Timers Get your people ready Remember you re gonna say Ready set as soon as that go All right Go Ready Set Go Oh You re supposed to get it Right here This great piling direction Did y all s work Yeah Good Good Did you record the time Look Tell him You guys are ready to keep going Five trials Good job And we ll discuss why yours worked in a minute We gonna take Okay hang on Tell me what happened When it got here it stopped It stopped Why did Friction Okay the Probably because the speed wasn t great enough Okay So you think you needed more speed No I think we need to take this off Okay Let s try taking that off Where do you think you can put those to get more speed Up here Ok Now what is that gonna give the marbles More momentum Yes Let s make it bigger Three centimeters Is this our second one Are we gonna do a second try You re going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works So reset it Okay Try again Did it work Yeah Let s discuss why did it work this time Look how we gave them these By doing what By um Making it higher Elevation Ooh And what s another word that Altitude Yeah That s good Okay So it worked How long did it take Seven seconds Face the recorder Got it Okay Very good Keep going You re ready for your second trial Okay We re done Y all already done five trials Okay Well let s just stop for a minute What comes down Let s pull together here Let s talk I want you guys to talk about why you think it worked Because the big hill helped The hill What force is that The hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum Good job So gravity pulled it down What did you say I said the hill s bigger than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go To make it through the loop Right And the force pulling it down was what Gravity Gravity Good Now talk to me about the order that you put it in Why would you you kind of just did We put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop To get more speed behind it Good And the turn would Make it slow down Yeah So what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end Friction Friction Okay Very good We got all five trials You guys need a knee Start recording your information It went really fast Really fast Just three seconds Did it work on the first trial No Okay Tell me what happened on the first trial It was like that And it just went off right here Okay Why do you think it fell off What was going on right here to make it fall Twist There was a twist in it So you just had to fix it so that it went straighter And so you pushed it Renny put it like this like around here Pushed it in So it might have been a little to steep too That incline might have been too steep What order did you put your elements in Hill loop and turn Okay And why d you put the hill first Because it s higher And it would give more speed What force is giving it more speed right here Gravity Very good Okay And then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn Why didn t you put your turn there If we turn there s not enough speed For the loop Okay Y all both said the exact same thing Repeat that to me so I understand If we put the turn first it won t have enough speed for the loop Good Very good All right Good job guys Have you got five trials It s all three seconds All of em were the same That s interesting Very good We ll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information Anthony what was your job Record So you were the one that found that they were the same each time Make sure you get written down everything Okay guys Talk to me We got three Did the first one work No Tell me what happened on the first one becuase I didn t see it The first one we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down right here when the chair was right there it kept on falling off So it just dropped So you think the incline was too what Straight It was too steep There you go That s the word I m looking for It was too steep Because it was right here and it was going all down Very Good So what did you do to fix it We kept on sliding it down a little Did you have to slide it down more than once Yes Good job guys So did you get it to where you could do five trials Yes And we got three for each Three seconds They did too They got the exact same for all of em How about that But look at your coasters They look different Yeah That s interesting too Cause their incline is steeper than yours Lets talk about the order that you have your elements in What s first The hill because it gives more speed when it s going down a hill so you don t But that s on what force Gravity Good job And why d you put your loop right after that Because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it Because if we did the turn it wouldn t have enough speed to make the loop Good job Good job Need a knee record your information and start figuring your speed Have you guys got all five trials Nope Uh oh What happened It stopped because of the friction When it get right here it started getting out of friction Friction right here What s causing friction right here Can I watch it Its gonna work this time because we taped it down Why do you think it s gonna work Because we taped it down You know what I want you to use that one How long did that take Seven Seven seconds All right Do it again Let s look at it again So it was stopping right here It always was stopping right there and then I taped it down Oh you taped this down That thing could be higher Okay I think you should try that We can use this clock No we need some more I was gonna get one of them books Guys you can use any state So what are you doing to the hills Making it bigger So the speed will go more faster More faster So that it ll increase the speed All right Let s see what happens Let s see if this one works Angel what are you doing Timing Ready One Oh We use good team work You are using good teamwork I m proud of it Ready Set Go It didn t start from the beginning I did not start that one Let me ask you this Just to give you a different idea because you ve already tried to change in the elevation of your hill Maybe how big the loop is How do you think that ll help So the will go faster and will make it go through All right We re gonna try this Help her out guys So we re making the loop smaller and that s gonna So now you might want to move this up a little bit there You see how this is gonna have to go There you go What about your taping If it s will the Yeah Let s try again Wait We were gonna time that honey Now you re ready to go So what was the solution to your problem To make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster All right Good job Now you re ready to time five trials Ready Go Look how beautiful Good job guys How many seconds Four Four seconds That s good How many trials Three We got two more I want to know You got three seconds on each one So your speed was the same Where did your distance come from We did how many feet and then we found out how many inches And times it by 18 because it s 18 on there How long was each tube Six feet Six feet How many inches is that Let s work it out Make sure you ve got it right on here 72 So you ve got 72 inches We only did one tube And how many tubes are there There s three tubes So 72 What would you do next Times three Yes 72 times three How did you guys get 216 You did 18 inches instead of six I mean 12 Okay So now you ll have to go back and redo your speed Figure in your speed So how do you find speed I still got 216 Well then you were right That s right So you guys are ready to go on to make a graph Let s talk about the graph you re gonna make Let s talk about the graph Thinking about what you ve learned in math and what you ve been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here What is this right here Time I want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs I want you to decide what kind of graph you should make Line graph because it s over time Yeah Line graph I decided Yeah we decided to put a line graph because it s time So any time you use time the line graph is the one to use Very very good Do we write the numbers on here Yeah How are you gonna know what numbers to put on there Think about it You ve got the trials the distance the time and the speed Do you need to use these You re probably just gonna use your trial and your speed So you ll label your line graph One will be the trial and one will be the speed And do you remember when you did the race car activity Not the race car activity I m sorry Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail What did that line graph look like It was a straight line Because it was a constant speed So what do you think this is gonna look like Constant speed A straight line Good Okay You ve got your trial You got your times Let s talk about your speed First we need to look at your distance How did you figure distance We need to divide by those speeds But your distance is how far the marble traveled right 18 Yeah 18 Yeah because you said each was six feet Six feet You re doing it in inches Oh So let s go back and refigure that I want you guys to talk about how to do that Cause we want it in inches So what is the first thing you would do Y all talk through it Y all talk to each other Let s talk about it After you re done erasing I was thinking like how many inches each Okay There you go Talk about it Anybody know how many inches are in a foot 16 Nope Try again If you have a ruler 12 Yep Good So that s 12 x 3 Good 36 Okay So 36 inches and then how many of these are there Three Uh huh 36 multiplied six speed So you need to do 6 x 12 6 x 12 is 72 Make sure you got it right I did it before It is 72 So now you will do 72 times Three Good Do it on your paper It s 216 inches Okay Now what are you gonna do Write it down And then what Multiply 216 to this So how will you figure speed now Divide Divide what Three to 216 Very good Can you tell me that again Jeffrey You re gonna do what Divide 216 into three And you ll only have to do it how many times One Because you got the same speed each time You can do three into 216 72 And no remainder That s nice Isn t it Now knowing what we know about graphs what we re doing in math Jeffrey are you listening Y all stop writing for a minute and listen Knowing what we know about graphs what we talked about in math and using this data and speed what kind of graph do you think you re gonna make Line Why did you say a line graph Because it s the same I want you to think about this right here Over time We discussed we need to use a line graph okay When you make your line graph which two columns there s only two columns that you can use on there Which two do you think you re gonna use This one and Well you ve already figured that out This one and which other one And speed good Right Because you were figuring all this for speed What do you think your line s gonna look like Straight Straight Because it was the same every time Good

six seven eight nine Eight Eight nine ten Ten eleven Let s do that one more time Alex Point to each one One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven There you go 11 What do you say I win You win good job Give me five Give me five Give Shanidra five Good job guys 
 Negative x minus it It s one over oh wait oh wait wait wait wait How do we solve for X X is the value of R anyway X is the value of R What would you do for the one over X Wouldn t that be the first term X is the value of R What I would suggest you do is is that you could rewrite this as an expression Oh as the power Oh Oh okay okay I used Oh yeah yeah All right yeah I got it So it s gonna be negative X minus one okay Okay no I got it So the first it s gonna be so what Whatever Oh come on I just wanted to find where it talks about It would be one minus one Oh we have one Is one over x the sum Do you see see what I m saying Yeah I m gonna put it in there so negative X minus one cause later it s gonna change Wait you don t really have to do it out since it s gonna change the so it s higher You ll have to you gotta Yeah No no no no no don t don t don t don t Don t even do that Do you know why Because it s part of a Well Yeah yeah yeah Cause the whole thing is negative and then that s the Remember the He s a natural But now here s the question You guys kind of already answered this question Could you have found it They give you basically R is two X Uh huh And since it converges it has to be less than the absolute value of You got it Okay That makes sense Go back for a second Yeah you multiply both sides by a third So it d be one third times every single one of em And the interval Um Oh Maybe someone s It means it s gonna get shifted and then You were just scaling the Because it s like I d never I never considered Oh okay Yeah It s not gonna change the domain of the Oh no no I m putting plus negative The answer Yeah So the only thing I m thinking is it might be easier for you to just It might make sense somehow Oh how do you read Yeah how do you No no no no no no no no It doesn t reduce the time it takes for it to No man right Oh okay yeah One third Oh I get it I get it It only converges as you No matter what well no matter what One over X Three X five X two in two over X I think it does Thank you You re welcome That s what I m yeah that s what I m saying One over X Because what they want you to do now So you d say power series is gonna be written as a form of say geometric series Because now you ve got what What s the first term Yeah Right Okay what s the ratio Negative And when you write that out put around it Let him once show him Okay Is it saying three X I would be I would take the Are you sure you re working together Yes And I ll turn it one We got one minus X squared One over one plus X squared That s X to the fourth right Minus X to the sixth plus X to the eighth This is if you are indexing this This is your first term this is your second term this is your third term right Think about the first one okay We have left that in order to get that a two X Like the first R okay the first side of it And say it s the second term that the first time So it s probably gonna probably gonna be it Probably Okay At least on these simple ones Okay Okay leave that for Okay N minus one over one minus one x minus one would be zero which would be Originally we have negative one X minus one The right one so it s either gonna be Now you re expanding by three instead of zero six So it s like negative X squared switched So the negative that goes over here is negative X squared too So the negative is which Y I don t uh I don t know what I m doing All right look hold on Isn t it the same as the third one That means that the Y like the same one Y is the common one Right To the one so this would be X minus one And negative Just put in one here four all right What s the ratio here One you re multiplying the outside of two X Another one you re doing it as the two X That means you re moving the X to the inside If you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple if you take arcsine of x any function you want and you multiply it by scale like one third one fourth Ah but then there we said No Oh my God what arc what are you wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on There s gonna be another one I haven t there and one third after that is what we re doing here Our R remains the same It s the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third Okay yeah I m agreeing to that I m pretty sure that s right You multiply this out it s gonna be one over three plus three x minus one Why are you multiplying it out Just think of it as a scale It s not anything to do it s not gonna affect our domain outside the function It s only gonna affect the range And therefore you re not gonna have any remains cause the remains only matter if you didn t have but like one third of it so we re not doing it like that One third after it we re doing like a stretched version So it s not gonna affect the equation so it s negative X What No no no no no no That s the series for Uh all right I m just negative X squared Right No no no I m putting negative x squared It s easier cause then later on when you do plus No no no no no I The sine s been switching No no Yeah but you can represent that by saying Yeah it s gonna be smaller Well it ll be switching but like would you represent how would you represent X in the whole thing To the negative see the n minus one is put that s how I m doing it Wait how would you find the If it s the absolute value of x minus one it would be less than one Mrs Dockin Yes Is this is this is this X We re not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change What is X over R Take this series right here which is that So then integrate it We just though you integrate every term to get it Now you re looking for a general expression Right You have a general expression It didn t tell you to come up with no they didn t tell you to do that Oh okay okay Okay because in fact that s not a power series That s not a power series It is okay but it s a different form of a power series So you don t have to write em like this because you would also need to have what You also have to have Right yeah okay Got it Okay You flip it around One good yeah good what s R The negative of yeah you re the negative x plus one but it needs to be in parentheses So now you need your R okay Now you re gonna do them when you get to It needs to be a form of K over R Oh I thought we just solve for R You said the third nominated was R All right guys she said 1 3 times one whatever that is How do you multiply these Does it need to be on the Yeah so you do it again Yeah multiply the whole interval yeah Multiply the interval And this is not in the form of a series That one third does that impact the greatness of one That s the question you want to answer I m not answering it for you right now you need to figure it out So when it s asking for does the function of the This it s like that You didn t divide it by seven 
 Alright Anne Carol what s your job How much sugar are you putting in Two tablespoons Two tablespoons There you go fill it all the way up to the top Thomason That s okay Thomas can you show her There you go That s okay You ll get it we re gonna make a mess today There you go Caleb way to open the bag for her Go ahead Anne Carol Why don t you pull it There you go One half cup of milk Good job Anne Carol One more We need more Need more That s good that s good There you go Alright good job baby girl What did we put in it Milk You can do it One whole cup One whole cup Hang on it s leaking Milk Milk spills Okay we ll get it You re good Alright Help them put it in there That was exactly one cup Exactly one cup Next is the milk That s okay There you go Okay now I need this Anne Carol Oh okay I need the other side Careful vanilla is really expensive I got it Vanilla How much did you put in A half Half a teaspoon Alright we re almost ready That was cool Whose turn is it Uh my turn It looks like chocolate milk A half cup Half cup Alright Anne Carol how ya doin over there Good It does look like pudding A liquid It s a liquid Do you think that s a solid Anne Carol No What is it Smells like it That s okay it ll get all over That s okay Sure no problem Yeah get it up to the top There you go Okay now Look good Yeah Alright Can we seal it Is that one of your directions Is that the next one Did we get everything in Yes Did we get sugar Yep Did we get our milk Yep Our vanilla Yes And our regular and our condensed milk Yes Alright Make sure it s sealed really really good We need the other bag Give me that bag sweetie Here you go Yep it s closed That s good we have two bags Oh what you got in there Thomas It s ice and rocks Is it sealed really really good Alright hold on we re gonna put this in first Hold on Alright what s in here Rock salt and ice Rock salt and ice Now what is this Liquid You think it s gonna freeze it Turn it to ice cream Let s find out Alright this one s gotta be sealed first Go ahead Thomas Seal it really really good You don t want it to leak Alright Yeah no cracks cause we don t want it to leak Think it s good Alright and then do this one Ready Anne Carol Uh huh We still got one more thing to do Four bags Isn t that right Ms Moore That s right Caleb Only two more There s like one bag and then three in there Let s see you make some ice cream Shake it and eat it Yeah About 30 seconds of shaking Yeah it looks cool Why you think we put rock salt in ice It makes the flavor Oh it s so cold It keeps ice from melting It does keep the ice from melting Very good Is it cold Anne Carol What happened to that We have like this ice cream maker and we like put in it and then we turn it on and it makes good My turn Alright I m gonna get this My hands are gonna cold I m gonna try to get the bag in the center Why you think I m rubbing my hands so they can get warm Do you think it s a solid yet Rub your hands Rub your hands Your turn It s gonna take a little while Yeah you can warm your hands up Because what s gonna happen if our hands are warmer It makes more warm Yeah it s gonna make it easier isn t it Alright you keep making that ice cream I m gonna go check on the other group okay Help each other Help each other Pass it on to Thomas Hey Thomas It s on the side we have to get it in the middle And the other kind needs to get cold Oh Oh it s so cold Caleb My turn please My turn No you already did it My turn It s my turn now It s starting to look like it It s mixed together Oh my goodness Whoa that s cold You think it s gonna turn into a solid Is that what s gonna happen Solid and liquid A solid and liquid Yeah because it melts Oh if it melts it s gonna be a Liquid Do you think that is a gas Anne Carol No What do you think it is A solid A solid It could turn into a liquid Do you think that an ice cube Hold on Amy s got a good question What did you say Maybe sometimes it could turn into a gas state How would you turn it into a gas Boil it You boil it Very good It could melt too and turn into a It could turn into one as it melts My house is a solid Your house is a solid Anne Carol Good job It s so cold Shake it shake it Give it a good shake Alright I ll be right back guys Try not to squeeze it then it might pop Ms Moore Yes ma am Will you do it please You want me to help you Okay Let s re check it and see Have to open a lot of bags What is it still Liquid So we re get it right in the middle You wanna feel it Whoa It s still a liquid Is it getting colder Yes It did mix together didn t it We re gettin there It does look like that now doesn t it That s okay Alright ready guys We re gonna get it more in there There s like 50 pieces of ice in there There is a lot of them Alright here goes your turn Kevin Getting colder Getting colder Hey look What you need sweetie Aw thank you darling Keeping your hands warm there Thomas Ready to go Do you think it s easier to go to the store or make it To the store Make it Is it more fun to make it Yeah Yes ma am That s okay You can make up your own flavor Alright if it s not your turn what I want you to do is you re gonna start to filling out these questions okay Yep you can start filling those out Alright you start filling those out You can help each other with these So what did you make Ice cream One thing was solid what was that Kayla Sugar Ice Ice and sugar Oh we did use ice We did use ice So three What else is in here though What else is in here Rock salt There you go Guys we re almost done Look look at it Keep going Yes It shows what were the solids you used Good you have one of them on there Salt Yep We used salt It s gonna be vanilla ice cream 
 We gotta work quiet It s three and a half inches long and is it Seven centimeters Keep going gotta keep going Wait wait wait wait wait It s probably about one pound Okay yeah let s go I don t know how You measure it with this inches then centimeters One inch That s one inch One inch Yeah then do it across We need one inch one and a half One and a half Three and a half You got it It s a bone got a bone Pick it up It d be easier if we could pick it up Here s a bone There s one yeah You all let s put it in the middle We gotta tear it apart now We don t have to tear it apart even more It s a bone It s part of that Wait hold on hold on and feathers You all start pulling those ones It s on my finger There s a ball It s a bird it s a bird No look at this claw It s a bird it s a bird It s a birdy bird Look there s its wait where s its There s its teeth and there s its It s a skull You all be careful with those little ones Just broke it Oh my god I found something You guys are being mean A skull I found a skull right there How many skulls did you all predict would be in your owl pellet I put one One How many have you found so far Was it right We found a couple bones What about skulls how many skulls It s tiny Alright how can you determine what kind of animal it is How much did it weigh Ten grams Ten grams Do you think do you think its weight has anything to do with how many skulls inside Why would that have anything to do with Because the skull might weigh about two grams maybe I think here s another skull It s got a lot of bones in it Okay see if you can determine what animal it is Looks kind of like a teacup This is a rat skull because I can see its teeth right here I know Jake found another skull I think This is a skull This is so cool Let s get playing boys and girls You all I think this is what we got No that is a bone No look look Where s the claw And look at this claw I think it s the same And then look Look let s see Oh that s a skeleton Oh that is a skeleton Ooh my touching it A whale Ooh yay we found a skeleton Look at the skeleton Chloe It s a skull It s a skull Ew ew ew ew ew Put the feathers and stuff over here Or whatever it is Yeah we need to the feathers Look this is soft It s not soft it has something There s a little baby bone It looks like a squirrel Look I got a baby bone No seriously What animal did you predict you would find in your owl pellet A bird A bird a gopher and a rat So what have you have you decided what it is A bird How did you determine it was a bird We found like big claws like this How can you be sure that it s a bird claw Because these are usually as hard and like sharper We put this Oh we got the skull and we got a skull How many animals how many skulls have you found We only found like two This is what I was thinking You know how it has sharp stuff up there What s a way that you can determine what it is I think we got a bird we got some more claws However much bones you find Compare the bones that you found to the bones on the chart I found another skeleton Keep working It has to be a bone this might be something right there Let me get that out because I haven t got anything out yet We got two skulls I found something I found this Another skull Yeah I think Found another bone You did Yep We found all sorts of here s another this is a claw It s a bird Is this a bird claw or I don t know I think that s a Where s the bird skull Found something What is it Wait hold on wait I think we ll find another skull What do you think this is Daniel What do you think this is I don t know Know what that is I bet that s probably something I think this bone might be something found in its arm You all look what I found I think this is a skull right here because We got them two don t worry We got a bone we got a bone We got the same skeleton Have you determined what your animal is No we don t know I think this is an eyeball We got a bunch of eyeballs Here let me see that Look look look It s a tooth Eyeball Let me see Look I found this This is the part of the eyeball Look look I found the Ew I found the pelvis I found the pelvis The owls are on this chart I think that might be something wait With the tweezers Here s an eye socket Over there somewhere This is this I think We need to get the hair out of it Oh my word I think we got Look I got the head See how sharp these are 
 Plug in two You got it We got it All right First question is Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to your partner no Let s try that one more time folks eyes up here What was the rule on the darts The rule is don t do anything until you say so Thank you Don t act until I say so Go Yeah There could be a little bit left of potential Is that what you mean Yeah Well All right On three I m going to need eyes up here please One two th Don t flip your card until I tell you to I shouldn t be able to tell what your card is It should be much more secret They re colored guys I can tell what they are Okay Here we go on three hold up your card please One two three Okay We ve got mostly disagrees And then we have very one confident Oh we disagree So here s what we re going to do Put your cards down I m calling on Mark first So where should we be looking Mark At Mark Okay Okay So I strongly disagree because say So you know you when you You know how you eat food you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running And then you re out of energy you re tired you go to bed you wake up the next morning it comes back You eat more food and it comes back Okay So you re getting it from a different source Yeah Okay but that energy you have originally So that initial energy that you have and then you ran Does it go away Yeah you have plenty more but does that original energy go away No Where does it go Because you still don t have it right You have to eat more food This is supposed to be challenging Great job Who has another idea Or who can tell me where does it go It s awfully quiet Awfully quiet What do you got I don t think it literally Well I don t think it goes anywhere You just It just keeps making more It makes more So the energy I burnt right So I m running and I m running and I m running Where does it go Out Out where To the air To the air in what form Breath Now this is tricky This is where it gets tricky Breath is made of what Vapor Carbon dioxide Water and carbon dioxide And we call that matter We call that stuff Is stuff and energy the same thing No No and this is really a tricky idea in Science So we re going to keep working with you on that So where does the energy go Out into sweat Out into Now okay sweat is Stuff It s stuff right But where So where does the energy go Does anybody want to change their answer And say once it s used up it s used up for good Anybody Some people I think Now Tatum what do you think I think that when you run it s Some of the energy go into the ground How many people agree with Tatum That some of that energy is going to go to the ground Oh yeah Yeah Okay In what form does it go to the ground In static stuff What s that I think you said static stuff Is that what you say Yeah Okay so static stuff is Now this gets really tricky because now we re getting into electrons But you re thinking about the rubbing kind of thinking Is that what you re thinking How it rubs And then you shock people Okay So that can happen That s a little more complicated so I m going to put that on hold for now But what So if I m running and that energy s going into the ground somebody said that Who said that Tatum Tatum Okay So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground In what form is it going into the ground Yeah Energy transfer It is an energy transfer right This is going from my foot to the ground What form is it in Do you guys know what I mean when I say form Yeah Yeah We talked about kinetic and potential and heat and what else we talked about Elastic and Light Gravitational and light and chemical Sound Heat sound Ooh there s just hey is any of that sound energy No No Maybe it could be sound energy Yes Sound Because you re You re stepping hard You re Okay so if I m running I m probably going to produce some sound Anything else that could go in there Jason Huh Okay I think that as you step on You ll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on you all react to gravity to the ground So gravity s pushing down now remember what gravitational energy is is how far it is away from the ground right So how much room it has to fall basically So would there be If I go like this would there be any gravitational energy there Wouldn t there be if you raise your foot Now it s got gravitational Here s what we need I m really doing something to say But here s what I want you to think about this one Actually let s do this one more time I want you to re vote on this Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to each other for 10 seconds You re thinking it s going someplace else I don t know where but I don t think it just disappears for good I think it s going somewhere That it s somewhere but just not sure where Yeah All right folks we re going to re vote on three One two three All right put your cards down for just a second Here s what Henry just said and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry And we re going to talk about again guys we re not getting answers to all these questions today we will at some point I promise We re going to do it in the formal labs but not before I m through telling you Henry tell me what you just said I think that it s not gone for good I m not sure where it goes but I think it doesn t just leave It s still somewhere but I don t know where How many of you agree with Henry That you think that it s somewhere but you re just not sure where I don t know where though All right Do you know what form No No Anybody else Know where But wait Doesn t it just transform It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be What What kind of energy is it All right but here s what we re going to do we re going to move on to the next one If a person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out Ready set go What s the evidence that the box has energy What form of energy is that that s moving I don t know Well it s kineck kineck One more try Kinetic Okay Because it s currently in motion Yeah Okay All right So now here s what I want We re going do a challenge question What about the person What kind of energy does the person have who s pushing it That I don t know You guys all have it Okay here we go Eyes over here please Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement All right here we go A person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out On three hold up your cards please One two three So what you re saying then is you all think the box does have energy am I correct Yeah Okay Chloe tell me why What is your evidence that the box has energy I think it has energy because when you re pushing it it has a friction with whatever you re pushing it How many of you agree that there s friction there Because it s rubbing against what The ground It s rubbing against the ground There could be some rubbing against you but most likely it s going to be rubbing against ground But here s my question what is your evidence that it has energy It does have friction and now it gives you some sort of indication that it s doing what Moving It s moving What do we call that something s moving What kind of energy does that Just shout it Kinetic Kinetic So it has kinetic energy So here s my next question so does anybody disagree The box does not have kinetic energy Tate I didn t believe it I thought it was transferred I thought that it was energy transfer Yeah Okay So you think energy s being transferred from the person to the box Yeah Okay but the question is still does the box have energy Even if I m transferring it there Does it have energy while it s moving Yeah Well do you mean before the person I mean while I m moving it I m in the process of pushing the box Does the box have energy Yeah but don t you think part of it would be from you and part of it I think all of it is from you Oh But does it still have energy Yeah Yeah it does So what s your proof Chloe just said it What s your proof that the box has energy Friction It s moving That it s moving Okay now the friction is proof that s it s moving perhaps But you also see it moving that would be the proof that it s moving Okay so here s my other question I m going to make this point this is too easy for you We re going to make this more challenging What about the person pushing the box So here is me this is how I push a box So if I m pushing the box what kind of energy do I have Think about it Jack what do you think Kinetic How many of you agree with Jack that I have kinetic energy How many of you think there s something else going on there as well No So I have I can only have kinetic energy right Because I am Moving Pushing Because I am moving and I m pushing Okay What other kind of energy must I have I have to say something else like it s kind of helping to and what disagrees Yesterday you told us the classic pool You re talking about energy transfer You guys know what she s talking about We re talking about the pool and handle Yeah I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the because you have the stick in your hand and you have the energy potential energy and then you start moving it and then it s kinetic and it goes through the stick and through the ball and it moves So you re saying that I have some form of potential energy as well Yeah before you start And then In what form is that potential energy Because I think Emily was about to say this too Think about this guys Where am I getting my energy from Is it gravitational No Muscles Okay so I ve got my muscles I ve got my body But where s that energy coming from Food Which is a form of what Marcus Fuel Which is a form of what Potential Time out We re asking Marcus Marcus what form of potential energy is fuel Um This is hard Did you want a lifeline Yeah Anika can you help him out Chemical Chemical right Make sense Yes Okay All right we re going on to the next slide Are you ready Yeah Woo hoo hoo Okay here we go Now goodness gracious Okay this is a hard one Cold moves faster than heat Ready set go And but also I remember my mom on hot days she s like Don t go upstairs because it s hotter Heat rises So is it is it move So your evidence that it s moving faster is that it goes up Yeah and also when you put it in hot hot water it s looser because Okay so you re saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well Yeah Faster than heat Okay How about moving in other directions other than up Is there Do you have any Wind Okay so that would So does one move faster than the other Tatum what do you think All right Think about it All right here we go Okay here we go So on three hold up your answers please One two three We ve got strongly agrees We ve got an in between We ve got an ooh we ve got a strongly agree And we ve got a couple in betweens All right We re mostly in orange land we ve got one green So here we go You ready Yeah And stand together you re going to back them up Yeah So okay so we agree that Are you sure No Just kidding Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain So you re a strongly disagree Okay Well I read it wrong I thought it said heat Yeah I thought it said heat moves faster than cold Okay so tell me why you strongly disagree then Tim Well because there s just as heat rises So it has to be lighter to move And so it must be moving faster Yeah How many of you agreed with this How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing Interesting And how many of you Nope you guys it never crossed your mind Okay Let s hop to another Tatum do have anything else to add to that No What is your evidence that cold moves slower Because he was just saying heat was rising do you have any evidence that cold would move slower Let s see Alex what do you think Well because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules they move faster when they re hot The coke can Yeah the coke can investigation Okay so I m going to ask them for specific evidence So what was your specific evidence in the coke can the hot molec that they were moving faster Well there was steam coming out of it and then in the solid everything s Molecules in solids are super slow And then as they move on to liquid then gas they move faster Okay And then you need heat to make liquid into gas How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold So let me ask you a question and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds then we might move on let s see What is cold Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold What is the idea of cold or coldness Okay think about it for a second Ellie what is cold Well it s like It could be water that s frozen in I was thinking that heat moves faster than than cold because if something was frozen the molecules wouldn t be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that Oh then it might be Okay so she gave me an example of what is cold But is coldness So what what does that even mean What does that even mean Anna Shivering What s that Shivering Okay shivering is because you are cold What is coldness Okay I think it s when the temperature is really low and everything s kind of darkness when you think of the sun warm it s really warm when you have the sun But it s when you think of something cold it s sometimes Okay I want You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is Here s what I want to think about Okay how to phrase this Is there a such thing as cold And if so how would you define it It s a hard question Oh You got to answer Get ready to answer Get ready and do one quick response and then we re going to put it aside for now and we re going to move on Come on Hunter No because it s just heat that s a That s just water that can be heated or Heat heat is cold Heat is that Yeah it s like Heat that s cold Yeah Oh So it s all just kind of a scale Like you got hot over here and cold over here and you re talking about there s less heat over here than there is here Heat has cold molecules Heat has colder All right So here s what we re going to do we re going to talk more about this later We re going to move on to the next question for now Here we go 
 Gina I wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids example Alka Seltzer Maalox and Tums can effectively neutralize Okay so far we ve been listening to this are we talking mostly the same equipment same supplies Yeah Right Maybe some beakers maybe some pipettes and some base Right Okay is this similar to Juan s This one is right So maybe we can start grouping these two together Christina The goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective Tide Clorox or OxyClean by determining which is most basic Any concerns Yeah Adrian How do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic Maybe there s some other factors that go into that and they re it s just basic ness Juan That some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors I mean Some of them have safety warnings that say like don t get too close to the vapors that come out Okay so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn t use them Is that what you mean Yeah Okay okay we use them in our homes but don t bring them to school right Yeah I m a little concerned too about your idea that it s about which one is most basic Okay Cause the active ingredient in Clorox I think is bleach and bleach Sodium hypochlorite Is sodium hypochlorite Which has a pretty interesting smell I d stay away from that And then we have Tide right Tide is not bleach all right I m not sure what the actual detergent active ingredient is but I m pretty sure it s not bleach So this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test and that it makes sense why we re testing it Okay All right we ll come back to this And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays so it doesn t matter it wins anyway I think he died didn t he Yeah he did it s too bad You know that guy must have made so much money I better not complain Adrian Go ahead I will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory To do this I ll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker I ll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate After as much precipitate as possible has formed I ll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected Any ideas Jimmy I m kinda wondering why it s important to you like you said to make the lab meaningful Yeah it should be So Adrian do you have a response It s just cause bottles that don t have molarity kind of annoy me and I feel like I should there should be like a label that says the molarity I just kinda You know my room is open fifth period every day you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations I don t have a free fifth period After school s fine too That s cool that s cool What concerns me is I thought the theme was titration right Is the theme titration Okay where is the titration aspect to this Do you know what I m asking here Yeah I know I just didn t realize Because you re mixing you re doing a precipitate reaction everybody see it that way I think you re doing a precipitate reaction and so I just feel like you know this you had the wrong theme going on here Anyway we ll move on Nicholas Artel Artel Sirhan Sirhan although he was a bad man though I think right He was accused of being a bad man Go ahead The goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more Vitamin C per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate crush them dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it I would also use a pH sensor to see what the solution to see when the solution is at seven to see when it s neutralized Doing this will let me know which company I should buy from for my Vitamin C pills What do you guys think Vitamin C is ascorbic acid I don t know if you wrote that Did you No okay so if it s an acid you can titrate it right Is anybody concerned about like anything here Jimmy Don t the pills tell you how much Vitamin C is in them Like the bottle Wait let me make sure if you buy a Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of Vitamin C my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets and you crush it and you do this experiment it s gonna be close to that 100 milligrams So are you testing because you think they re not accurate Yeah Oh Okay so you re testing for accuracy on their part just to keep them honest Because I mean 100 milligrams it s kind of a non specific number All right Ian Actually another way you could look at it is that just because it says 100 milligrams that s how much of the Vitamin C is in it that s not how big the tablet is Being that sometime I mean you could have and say just arbitrary numbers you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin C or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it actually had more stuff in it per density Okay but is that what you want him to do I thought are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100 you don t care how big this tablet is unless unless what s the danger here Some of that other that tablet contains acids or bases in them then that would affect your results right One of them I have is pretty pure it s pretty much just ascorbic acid the other company I have does have some other stuff in it so I was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly Vitamin C Have you ever been to like the CVS and looked in the section I mean I could find one I just haven t There s a bunch you could even What d you guys figure out It s turning yellow Why do you think it s doing that Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic I didn t think it would be that big of a deal because Wait Hang on so you mean so far what you ve done is you ve crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue Yeah And that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want That s right That s what you re saying Yeah What color should it be Blue I guess It s kind of green It just looks as if this coloring is just green dye Have you thought about using like phenolphthalein That has a distinctly pink color otherwise it s clear No we did not think of that You wanna try that Yeah Yeah that d be better So the phenolphthalein is gonna be it s probably going to be behind If it s pink it s acidic right No if it s basic Do the bubbles matter All right could I just stop and ask you guys did you guys get your color change you were looking for Yeah So the titration is working out Yep Very clean What So tell me what you got here This is a disinfecting Clorox we re just starting out we re just trying to measure out 10 milliliters That one we re done with we got it to the brown like it didn t stir anymore that was it That s as far as it went We put in 61 and that was it Now we re going to start this one And that worked with the one molar So is this oh so this is a different concentration Or how is this one different this is just a different This is a different type and it s a different percentage of the hypochlorate That s disinfecting spray and that s bleach With a different type of Clorox cleaning product All right Did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous No we did not make sure But they re I just wanna you know we don t wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here When we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing And this was fine like it said it should be done in basic and everything Okay God bless you Excuse me How s everything going Not good with this one What s in there It s red wine vinegar But it hasn t changed color The treatment s too powerful Yeah we re thinking it s too So we re gonna do the white What s the solution to that then Why don t you just use less Less of the vinegar Right All right So we use five milliliters instead of Well I mean right If you use less then don t you think you ll be able to titrate it Easier Well you d need less base to get there Right Okay Let s go over here see what happens over here So squeeze that out What are you guys so you ve got Vitamin C crushed in there you used is this bromothymol blue what did you use Yeah we used BTB and now we re gonna see how much base we used Just out of curiosity why did you use a graduat what is this about 50 You didn t want to use like Cause that is are you gonna All the other ones were like dirty Yeah they were kinda And I think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment s limit All right coming along okay it looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hi You re adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue Yeah Is that too much Well has it occurred to you and it probably hasn t it s okay bromothymol blue itself is either a weak my guess is it s a weak acid it could be a weak base but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases So we always want to use a bare minimum amount Therefore how about if you use something that has a distinct color change roughly at the neutral point like phenolphthalein Cause then it ll go from pink your This is acid These are acids so they ll go from clear to a pinkish color Okay okay but do you think the pink will be able to be seen Well Like the blue one You know the blue you need to use a lot more to get there although I don t know I suppose since you already did this one I mean we could remeasure out You may wanna well we don t want to run out of time here so right Stay consistent and then consider it how you can make improvements later Okay All right Now that s very nice You guys have questions What was your results in comparing what the company says and what you There was a little bit less since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure pure ascorbic acid As in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to which is it s pretty close and the other one was around than what you re probably paying for But But that s then again it could ve been because Because not all the powder dissolved some of it was still settled on the bottom So they could be really accurate Yeah they could be you know dead on For the trials did you guys use different amounts of stuff for the two trials For the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill and then for the third trial we used 100 right A hundred And then for those trials like the third one you said you used a different concentration of NaOH Yeah Why did you use a different concentration First of all there wasn t much left of the 567 and also you know who s to you know maybe that could ve been contaminated it might not have been 567 so it s also good to use some different stuff sometimes Right You can t always base it you can t have it all on one thing Yeah that s smart How did yo actually figure out the amounts What was the math Oh We did the stoichiometry Yeah but we assumed that it was a one to one ratio one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one OH from the base And so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C Do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one H plus No we just assumed that for the experiment Maybe you should look that up Yeah Yeah The other thing anybody else So the other thing is and I just wanna make sure when you said 500 milligrams that s 5 grams right We did it accurate with Yeah cause that thing the scales here give you two sig figs right Okay I mean to the hundredths hundredths of a gram right So you crush this thing and you weighed out 50 Yeah That s what you did it How much was left in the I mean of one tablet when you you know what I mean When you crush it Yeah How much We had excess I mean one of the pills I had was 1000 milligrams so we you know we had about we had a like about It is my fault for Oh you were using 1000 milligram tablets And then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven like milligrams That s how we removed So we had to we removed mass Oh well how bout this if it if they say 500 but the thing weighs six What d you say six or seven hundred Oh yeah Then aren t there other ingredients already in there Not that were listed like Yeah they weren t listed It just said it just said Vitamin C Because they might just list the active ingredient right Yeah In other words if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim my guess would be there s more of something else Okay Because here s another thing Don t you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the Vitamin C in a clump Do you see what I m saying Yeah yeah And they ll typically use some there s gonna be some certain chemicals they re gonna use that s in there So I have a feeling before you write the company be careful they re Yeah yeah They probably added other ingredients Yeah Because what I think might ve been even better is if they claim 500 then why don t you just crush the whole thing regardless of how much it weighs And then titrate that You see what I m saying Yes Cause then they re claiming there s the You see what I m saying So that would be taking further just simply Yeah that would be The experiment Wouldn t that be like the next Yeah Thing that you could try Same thing with 1000 right I mean if they claim 1000 Yeah Go crush the whole thing and see what 
 So our question was What are the reasons why Holden has a sudden acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up And I got this question because I feel like the carousel represents growing up because you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you re not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you re just sheltering them and they re just going to live a sheltered life So they can t really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing Yeah I agree with him with Damon because I think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life Because it never really stops just continuously goes around and around And the goal is to grab the golden hoop And I think that symbolizes I don t know happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it And if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants it s just like no I m not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want They re sheltering them from their own happiness kind of Because I also agree with Brandon but I also think that let s just say Phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off I don t know if Holden would go to her but I think based on his character he would But then I think that would be bad just because like Brandon was saying if you don t let them fall if you don t let them make their own mistakes then they re not gonna learn from life So like my dad he s so overprotective I think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves Not necessarily because I think that s their fear learning from their mistakes So I just think it s better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life I think people have a hard time letting go of any child whether it s their brother their sister their actual child because it means that they re leaving soon and they re actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister they don t want you to experience the same thing that they did too so they re like telling you what to do and it seems like they re telling you how to live your life but they re giving you advice I think parents the reason that they re so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss because it really is and innocence is in a way you know because you don t know And so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they re actually making them sad if they just won t relax so they can And also I think a lot of kids don t understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you ve been born They preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they re trying to shield you from everything but they re just trying to look out for what s best for you But you can t think of it like oh once this one chance goes by I ll never have it again Because it really is like a carousel You re gonna keep going on and you will have another chance Going back to the carousel I also thought that the carousel it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it So I think Holden kind of realized that even though the carousel he knows have different people on it you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can t always keep them the same like the carousel it s not a real machine or something We all have to grow up eventually Just listening to you guys what do you think about when I was home in Los Angeles my nephew at that time was about six months old And at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that like leaves You d show him an apple and he s like Ahh And then he puts a leaf in his mouth And you re just like Holy You have to dig it out kind of a thing So in one respect I mean it s just like there s this idea of let people figure out things on their own but in that respect he ll die if you let him figure out oh you can t eat that So I m just trying to think as far as a parent goes how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them And I think that s part of the conflict Holden is having he s trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against Me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like I know that I have to let you go And I think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are Like if you do what you re supposed to do and you show them that you re working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you That s true and I also think that it s not really based on yourself mostly It s based on your parents and how they ve grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it s just nature you just know when they re ready That s what I think I don t think really it s just based on all of their mistakes I just think it s pretty much based on Interesting I think when people start changing and stuff like their attitude because I ve noticed my little brother he s starting to change and he has an attitude now He s starting to get a little rebellious and stuff and I think that s when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own and it s not just being told what to do and stuff You have to have that experience to learn from Every person has their own free will Like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can t make it drink You can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can t force them to do anything you can just have an influence on them And that s something that parents have to understand You can t force your kids to do their homework but you can ground them if they don t All right guys I want you guys to keep going You guys are doing a great job I can see your notes are also looking pretty good I m gonna move on to another group okay But keep this going because I think you guys can come up with a lot more okay Thank you guys You guys are doing an awesome job with your volume we re gonna come over to this group over here All right can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up We have a couple of questions we have like Oh okay Let s just come up with tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about The first question is my question which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people And I kind of came up with that question because Holden he kind of was denied of his childhood because Allie died and so that really impacted him And since that he s kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of Phoebe Like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she s too big for it He s like No you re not He s trying to help to her keep that innocence or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied It kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing It goes against like parent versus child So a parent when they have a child they kind of want to live their life through their child And they make them do all these chores to get into because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn t want them to do it So they kind of Interesting I said that I just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps I had these two other questions because I was reading the book where I was wondering why I was trying to get more in depth with why Holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye Okay so I kind of answered it and I said it s very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can t get back up Just like when you lose your innocence you can t get it back because this experience happened If you get exposed to it you can t magically forget it It just stays with you and that s a part of you that s just lost Interesting That kind of relates back to the question about It seems like Holden is kind of holding onto his past and so he s still living in that innocent stage and when he s living an innocent stage he can t make a wrong decision which is very hard from his now because he s 16 he keeps transferring to all these schools and he can t really grow up because he still has that memory and so that s why he s confused about his identity Good point Going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people it kind of goes through influences too Like he was talking about James Castle and when he died he said that James liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about oh yeah that s a pretty great idea It s not bad but why would people be waiting for that It was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas And I think going back to that question again that sometimes parents want the best for their child so they convince their what they want their child to be If that makes sense And at the end sometimes you can t force the child to do what they don t want to do So in a way it s kind of like you guys said the parent versus the child They wanna form their own identity as a teen but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them Is that what we re kind of getting at through everything They re so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go Is that what we re saying Yeah kind of Like Holden says he s trying to protect that innocence because he s always referring to There s a part where he s walking down the sidewalk and he called Allie to help him cross to the other side And that s kind of interesting because usually you don t think an adult would say that A child would say that And it s because he s mad at his parents because they won t talk about it so he s kind of just living with this Interesting So he s just trying to find a way of coping Is that possible Yes And then there was another kind of question about where Holden comes to Kiana said Why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on And I thought of this question because when Holden was inside just his room Phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like You don t like anything You don t like anything And he was trying to make up stuff that he did like Like he did say he liked Allie and she ll say he s dead so pick something else And he was arguing with her saying that just because he s dead you don t forget him and you can still like someone who s dead And he thinks that Allie is thousand times better than nicer than people who are alive today now So that just proves how he s holding on to that and he s not planning on forgetting that and he holds that near and dear to his heart And so that s probably why he doesn t like a lot of people because he compares them to how Allie was and his innocence his maturity level how it was then and how he sees how people today because kids don t understand he s holding on so he doesn t really understand what s going on Anything else to add on to this No I like what you guys are doing I like how you re tying in the death of Allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing What about the carousel first of all I don t know it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all Cause I know he would probably ride it too Did he ride it I was thinking of repetition because how the parents feel it rotates around and round And whenever Phoebe passed by he would tell her how pretty she looked She was never changing That s kind of what he wanted he wanted her to stay in that stage and nothing to change Nice All right guys I m gonna check on another group I want you guys to keep going with this you guys are tearing it apart Good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together All right and your notes look good as well too I like it I think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more Okay hi guys You guys the volume is doing really well So you guys fill me in Okay Tell me what you guys talked about Just mostly like and symbolism in the book Start getting louder 
 All right so we re going to need someone from all the groups to kind of summarize for us Grace Guys raise your hands So I figured okay you guys should All right I need everybody on the floor and you two groups sit right here okay Everybody s on the floor criss cross applesauce in five Five four three two and one Okay I need you to stay where you are and just turn around and I ll just have the people come talk to me and they ll talk to you all right We re going to start with let s see We re going to start with group one all right People from group one raise your hand Okay Will you girls come up and tell me what you guys talked about And I m going to listen Our question was select three characteristics that you think is most important for school and tell why So we had our score card and it said stuff So then the first one we did was my manners because if you re nice that means that you re polite and then you get more friends All right Next Following directions because you won t have good behavior and you won t do good on a test if you don t follow directions and you don t do like your study guide or study then you won t do good on a test And our last one is behavior in class is because behavior is sort of like not listening because then you probably won t listen if you re just doing like All right Thank you Now tell us everybody we re doing this and everybody can answer So how do you think that relates to a job Behavior Yes If you have good behavior then you ll get somebody to hire you because you can work good If you have good behavior most likely you ll get hired because you Anybody else Nobody else Yes ma am Um it s sort of like what they said but if you have good behavior when you re working your job you won t get fired Okay You won t get fired And you know good behavior is one of those things such as coming to work on time okay If there s nobody there to work your position then your teammates have to pick up the work or the work doesn t get done Okay group two let s see Lauren go ahead come up and read your question and answer please What is a non traditional career for a male and a female And um Go ahead We wrote for a male a fashion and a nail designer That s right And then for a female a pilot and a car designer Good good Can someone thank you Can someone give me some more ideas about some things let s see I m going to call I m looking at colors I m going to pick somebody with this color on And you can take your jacket off and I m still going to call your color if it s your color red Give me a job that you think might be a non traditional career One for a woman What did you I mean you can use the video as an example You want to think about it Construction worker A construction worker as a woman My color s red Yes sir For a woman or a male It could be for a male or female Or you can it doesn t even matter Skyler For a girl maybe a football coach For a female definitely a football coach If you guys watch Glee you see the football coach is a male a female And so yeah But now Sakwan we re going to go with you last and then I m going to go to group three Um for a male probably a teacher A male as a teacher Exactly So let s have Grace not Grace Alex Alex Mallory Mallory do you have a V under your name Yes You re from group three So let s let me read yours and you guys answer You can stay there Let me read it and you guys answer So group three was using what you have learned about non traditional careers what would you say to someone when they say that a boy can t do a job or a girl can t And I will just let you guys read I would say that it doesn t matter if you re a male or a female as long as you like your job and you can do your job well Nobody can tell you that you can t do something just because you re a boy or a girl Good Does anybody disagree with that one No Does anybody agree with that statement Okay All right Sakwan come up do you guys are going to do number four and we re going to move to the next activity Our question is what plans do we have for being successful in schoolwork We wrote do your homework follow directions paying attention being respectful good grades and not shouting loud And the oh yeah And don t have some like yelling or like stealing things like Report cards Yeah but no Yes Well we did a couple like Writing is a little challenging Reading easy some books Okay So they went with the idea of you know not too easy not too hard Good Thank you Now what we re going to do now is we re going to do some research on non traditional careers Now some of you will be where the purple papers are Some of you will be where the white ones are And it s just so that you guys will be able to talk about this later and say okay this is what I experienced on a policy job and this is what I experienced on the other one So everybody point your attention to the front and I m going to go through one of the worksheets with you I m going to go through the harder worksheet with you okay Just point your attention to the front And I m going to go through this one with you because this one is the hardest one and then all the other ones are the easier ones Okay the worksheet that we re going to do today is going to tie in what you guys talked about with careers subjects When do you all get report cards We got it yesterday You got them yesterday What I want you to do is I want you to think about your report card your favorite subject whether it be English math science social studies whether it be PE art whatever it is and I want you to pick from this site You see this site It says www bls gov k12 okay I want you to pick from that site your what subject you did the best in or what your best interest is There are some of you I know somebody here likes nature They will pick nature and in that job if it s a boy he s going to pick a job that he thinks mostly females have Who thinks they can give me an idea of what job mostly females have Molly Maybe a veterinarian A veterinarian Most veterinarians I ve seen have been female So I would go there And if I was a boy I would read through this sheet On this sheet it has some questions It says how to get ready You ll find that tab and you ll give me a summary of how they get ready for this job It says what is this job like You read that and you ll give me a one or two sentence summary of what the job is like And it says are there other jobs like this That s to the bottom And you can write those jobs down Another one says what about the future And you ll write a one or two minute summary of that section Also we have some reflection questions at the bottom of this worksheet and the reflection question is one is what did I learn about careers The other one is what s a non traditional career and the last one is what did I learn about myself So make sure you answer all those questions in the worksheet Now if I was a girl and I went to nature what job do you think I would pick Alea What job do you think most boys have that s over here for nature Zookeeper Maybe a zookeeper So the object of this is to do research in the area that you find most interesting Is this what I have to be when I grow up Mr Nealy No You just have to do research in that area So the big important part is to have research done in that area just so that you can explore different jobs And I think was it group three that had that question Yeah Group four that had the question about what would you tell somebody Who had that question Us Group three had that question and I think you guys gave a pretty convincing argument Okay I m going to tell you who s going to sit at the purple stations If you re sitting at a purple station you re going to click yes you want sound And your worksheet is already there And I want us to compare and contrast the different information you get from the two worksheets Okay purple station Skyler go to a purple station Mr Y 
 Um that one substance there s no other types of substances laced into the main substance Okay And what is yours A substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it Okay so I hear three different things here okay I hear pure means one substance not mixed with anything else I hear pure is something that s not altered or manipulated in any way And then I hear something s that natural I want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions So do you agree with those three definitions or not And tell me why And tell them why Well I don t think it s natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures Can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures Um like trees So what And you re saying a tree is a mixture because why Because it like has different colors and different like feels to it Oh so different colors and different feels so like different textures Is that what you re saying And why does that mean that it s a mixture Cause it s not all the same How do you know I don t know I don t What do you guys think Do you agree with her that a tree is something that s natural but it s a mixture So and that was your definition that you got natural I would say it s natural Like some things are natural some things aren t natural I guess cause Think about like when a diamond forms It s a natural thing and it s only that substance Sure I agree with you with that example A diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure But for your definition what I want you guys to think about is a definition that s true all of the time So for a tree I want us to use that example about a tree really quick Cause you re saying it s a mixture right So you re saying it s a mixture cause you have different colors and different textures Why is that statement different colors an indication that it s a mixture Well it s like it Okay And a difference between substances What is color an example of Michelle Characteristic properties Characteristic property which we know what about characteristic properties It is characteristic to that one substance It s characteristic to that one substance Okay So would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about Yes Okay So what I want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper Okay Hey you guys I know you re discussing it and I hope that you re kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions Here s what I m going to have you do Based on your conversations it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper that your whole group agrees on I ll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we re all on the same page or not Okay We already had one discussion where we had three different definitions My guess is when I read what they write down they re now going to have an agreement on what a definition is But I may be wrong so let s see Write your definition As soon as you have it done hold it up in the air Pure substance same thing Pure or pure substance Okay so what do you want to do What was your definition My definition well huh What did you write literally First time the first time Yeah the first time What did you write initially I wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like clean It s not dirty or anything Good and then what did you change it to A pure substance is a substance that has not been touched Okay and why did you change your definition to that Like what made you Did it happen because you guys talked about it Yeah Okay so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to something that hasn t been touched He said like a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the Earth Okay So you said it s something that naturally comes from the Earth So is that what you mean by not been touched Yeah So it s just natural and not manipulated by people Yeah So it could have been literally touched but Unprocessed Unprocessed okay So give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists Um Tree Okay so tell my why you think a tree is pure It hasn t been really been really processed or anything it s in the forest Okay so then what do you know about color of substances Um Sometimes it s a characteristic property It is a characteristic property right Which means each substance has it s a certain color And for that substance it will always be that color When you think of a tree do you see one color or do you see multiple colors Sometimes multiple Multiple colors so what is that evidence of Multiple colors Characteristic property It is a characteristic property but I mean how is having Hey Brett Can you please focus on what you need to be doing Do you have your definition done Yes Okay here s what I would like the rest of you guys to do including Brett s group You now if you have your definition written down I want you to go ahead and start doing number two Give me your examples of pure substances And give me your explanations I m going to give five minutes for that That means 10 38 So A tree has multiple colors Green is going to be an indication of of what Would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance Not really No okay why not Because leaves or grass Bark is a tree Okay so you re saying that more than there s more than one substance maybe that can be green Okay But okay so that s fine If there are different colors of green do you think that means different substances No What about characteristic properties though What do you know about a characteristic property It never changes for a substance It never changes for a substance So if I have two different greens do you think I have two different substances No I would Cause that s the definition of a characteristic property Right one green would be characteristic for that one substance always Never ever something different If I see a different color that must mean I have a different substance Okay If I have two substances together do you think that s a mixture or pure Mixture Mixture So a tree Do you see multiple colors on a tree Yeah What does that indicate A mixture A mixture of multiple substances Is a tree natural Yeah Yeah so does that affect your definition for pure If you re saying it s a mixture it can t be pure but it s natural so maybe our definition needs adjustment So think about what you might change your definition to be now okay Okay and write one down Are you done with this problem It s anonymous Okay well then Water isn t is it Oh interesting so you guys you don t know if water is or isn t You explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and Something else Okay so let s Okay well what s the chemical formula for water H two O H two O so what elements are combined to make water Hydrogen and oxygen okay So I agree with you there hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together which makes water okay So do you think water is pure or a mixture Well when they do the water definition we were trying to decide like if something s straight like we could some not a mixture Okay Then is it pure Okay I m going to read your definition really quick okay So a pure substance is a raw substance Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature There is no trace of any other substance It is not a mixture Okay I see two definitions in there Here s what I see I see a definition that talks about it being I see three One your definition is something that comes from nature Another one I see is Something that has not been changed Another one I see is no trace of another substance So that sounds like one substance Okay those are the three definitions I see But is there a substance from nature that hasn t been changed No Water is a substance from nature that hasn t been changed I mean yeah we add things to it It hasn t been changed but it is a mixture Is it a mixture though Yeah But what about when like animal live in it and stuff does it change So you re kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way If it gets in contact with something else Yeah if they re even from nature So here s what today we should be able to figure out by the end of the period And you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure Here is my hint My hint to you is the way we can tell by looking at something if it s pure or a mixture cause you can or maybe not just by looking but experimenting with it It s based on characteristic properties of matter That s what I want you to think about So it s just the primary colors then What do you mean Primary colors Well the primary colors I don t know It s just that color So is color a characteristic property of matter Yes What does that mean then Wait but can t you change it When something s a color But when you add one color to Something Like if I add a color to the water doesn t it change the water When you add a color into water it mixes with the water So it s not still water It still tastes like water I didn t say that I just said it was mixed It s a mixture oh Okay I didn t say that either but If you put the food coloring in it So and why are you saying that s all of a sudden a mixture Because they re So different substances together okay So what then does pure mean Not mixed a substance by itself A substance by itself So you believe water is just a substance Okay Alright Alright you guys These crutches are going to kill me Are you okay Those hurt you re hurt Okay you re okay We re going to talk about it right now okay Do I have everybody s piece of paper Are you done Okay This is not true Really Yes Alright turn here and stop what you re doing Listen to what What I want I know that you may not be done with your examples yet Because you re still struggling with your definition of pure I want to show you what other groups are thinking So I m going to show you all these I ll ready them for you too so that you re going to see that we have differences And the idea is by the end of today based on what we do you should be able to change and finalize your definition Okay And competently be able to give me examples Alright So the first one and I ll try to move this Let s make sure you can see this If it s hard to see Tim will you turn off actually why don t you go ahead and do that now Tim I think it will be better I don t know But just the front set of lights Thank you We ll come down Okay The first definition An unprocessed material which is one substance by itself instead of combining multiple substances to get the material I see two different definitions I see one pure means to be unprocessed and then I see another one substance by itself Okay Here s another one A pure substance is only one substance that is not a mixture So you re starting to see that pure and mixture which I will agree with are basically opposites of one another So you ve got to explain the difference between them So a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture So I m wondering what your definition of mixture is Who wrote does anyone Who wrote this one are you willing to share Do you have a definition for mixture then Um well multiple substances that are mixed together Good so you re saying so great your definition for pure is one substance while mixture would be more than one substance Okay This one says a substance that has no mixture involved So you re saying that there s a clear difference between the two I still don t quite see a definition for the word pure yet in this definition A pure substance is a substance with no other substances mixed in It is one single substance So I m starting to see a little bit of a trend A pure substance is a raw substance Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added It came straight from nature There s no trace of any other substance It is not a mixture So we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different but I see three definitions One it s something that is raw or something that and I think this is what this is saying Correct me if I m wrong but you mean by raw kind of in some way connected to natural Okay so something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other So I kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple Okay as a definition Okay maybe I only saw two Okay Oh I thought this one was typed I was like How did that happen How did Was that you is that your handwriting That s insane Okay I like it It s like prefect Woah Okay There you go Alright A pure substance is a substance or material that hasn t been mixed with any other substance It is only one substance Okay um Two Two more A substance is only one substance and it is not mixed with any other substance right And our last one Oh this one s actually different A pure substance is an element Okay that s a different definition than the other things I ve heard They are made up of one atom They are not mixed with other substances nor do they contain other substances within them So I hear two definitions in here One being pure means that it s just an element And then I see another one that it s a single substance Okay So I want to hear some of the examples you re coming up with right now And I m not going to say if they re right or wrong I m just going to try to probe you with some questions Okay Naud What is one of your examples Salt Okay so you say salt is pure Why do you say salt is pure Because we don t think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt So you re saying that to be pure means one thing one thing in that container and you re saying if it s just salt that must be pure Mm hmm Okay Miriam It has to be raw and like like plain like raw salt Like not like mixed with preservatives or Okay so literally just salt that s it Yea Okay Alright so let s take another example Or if you disagree with them you can also offer up your argument for that Shaina what do you think Well we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance Why Well I think a diamond can only be cut by itself and can only be cut with a different diamond OK So that s really dense so we thought that if anything was added to it something else would be able to cut it And that would be something else that was less dense So interesting What is um You re talking about density What is density It s a characteristic property A characteristic property So this is good You definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter Okay That is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture Who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is Hannah A property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance Yeah a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount So what I m hearing you say is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density And you re saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond it must mean that the densities are the same And so since the density is the same for the whole diamond that means it s one substance 
 She saw sparks in the sky and a beautiful panda bear appeared in front of her Don t be scared I m your Fairy Panda Bear I will turn you into a beautiful princess so you can go to the parade But I don

 Okay so put these where they need to go on the board And Liz your job is graphing So Harper tell me about your data You your plant is 20 centimeters Okay and it s grown 11 centimeters Wow that s a lot of growth isn t it Good job And Emma what s your job You were the recorder And so some of the observations The leaves are bigger It has grown bigger In the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves Cool in the middle of the leaves there s tiny leaves That is interesting And your cotyledon has come off Okay so that s good Excellent Okay so Coby you re going to be using the board and putting your data up there So tell me how high how tall is your plant now 20 centimeters Okay let s go check your graph We re out of room I have more So next time you ll have a graph that will be take two of this and it will be 40 centimeters Because 20 plus 20 is 40 So here s your 20 centimeter line what needs to go down here Okay now remember to help Parker with observations Natalie does the board Oh Natalie go up there Okay girls let s talk about what your findings are because just a second Talk to me about what happened with your plant Let s take a look So what do you think has is the reason for it not changing It was 10 centimeters when you started It was 10 centimeters again on Monday Okay but that s okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination It s done with that now and it can grow without it Is it a growing plant Looking at your graph Is it growing So maybe the leaves will get bigger and then The roots will get bigger too the roots will get bigger The water and the nutrients Okay let s take a look at your observations Roots longer white root cotyledon fell off leaves are pointy bigger leaves Now what did we observe about the growth About the growth of the plant What did we observe about it I think we should include that in your observations Okay so observer should record that Okay boys and girls I need all board job people to come on up here Okay now you guys one at a time are going to fill in your data Make sure that you re choosing a new color And I m going to make sure that these have seen all of your I don t think I ve heard about your growth here Okay tell me about what happened Joshua you need to go sit down work on the math You re not ready for that yet Okay so talk to your group and see what you need to do next Okay so tell me about what has How about the growth Right now it is okay so Alex Yes go get some Now your plant has it s 12 centimeters now it started at So how much total growth has Okay so it started at the 10 and now it s a 12 So can we make that who s the recorder So we want to make that because this is how much is it growing Okay so it s growing and let s look at our graph You ve got your day and now Oh so you went up a little bit too high here Let s take a pencil Alex and just do a small X right there so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12 Maybe more so that we can see it Keep erasing it that s good Don t play with your plant please If you re all finished you should be working on the math problems Okay now let s talk about your plant Okay let me come around here Tell me about your plant It started to get bigger The shell was growing out and we it s And how much has it grown total 50 Oh five Five that s right You started at seven and now you re at 12 so the difference between That s exactly the same as my plant too What I noticed about yours is over the week it came out of like you said the seed cover came off and the leaves Started to peel and it started to break Yeah Okay so the stem is really long Let s put this up here The leaves are bigger Who is the observer You are okay And can we see something about the seed cover Okay so while he s doing that we need to do some important things here What about the date One 30 goes here because that was Monday One slash 30 Okay and today s date is Okay and that s it because today s the third and this bar shows Natalie go sit down This bar shows that Good job you guys and you ve got that added And let s make sure that we re gentle with that measuring You can work on it together Molly stay with your group You guys work on that together You guys can work on it together So you guys have had what s the most common number of seeds they found Five Five good How about the total number of seeds Now do we know is each dot worth one Okay so what s the total number of seeds So how many seeds in all Okay boys and girls Sophia s finishing up If you have math extension problems in your table group please put those to the side And I m going to ask Chloe s group and Angel s group and Derek s group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we re close to our graph You do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already Chloe come join us please Alright Ashton and Josiah you can move closer so you can see or you can stay there Coby and Isaiah please come join us Alright Now one last person needs to fill in her data Let s see that would be me and my height was 16 Okay so while I m doing that take a look at the graph we just built And think about what are some things that you notice about the graph What do you see What are some things in common What are some things that are different Turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph Okay eyes on me Now you tell me what are some things that you noticed about the graph Alex That six and three has the same height as us Okay so group six and three and you are group Five Five all have the height of all the way across and it s 10 12 Centimeters That s right so we have three groups that have the same height Ashton what did you notice So group one four and your group eight they re all not matching But all the other ones have a match So group eight and one and four are separate They don t have someone who s kind of similar So that leads me to ask about groups two and seven tell me about them Blake Seven and two are the same Seven and two are the same they both are the same why Keith Because they both have 20 20 Centimeters So what group on there has the smallest plant Alfredo what group on there has the smallest plant Group four Toby and how tall is group four s plant Ten centimeters Ten centimeters that s right Now group four Molly tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant 
 I think we need the policeman because he s the only one with a weapon He s the only one with a weapon though What if he goes crazy He s the only one with a gun Exactly that s a good thing though Wait a sec why is that a good thing Are you saying he d shoot us I didn t say it s a good thing if someone could shoot us No I didn t say that You said it s a good thing Explain why you think it s a good thing It s a good thing because we could stock the food Drake OK so he said two things But he might shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us We could take him he wouldn t shoot us Where you at Riley it looks like you re sweating I m trying to think between you two So you write down what you said you d do and you worry about everybody here Who do you think is the most important Eileen says the policeman does everybody agree with that or not Yeah Why Because if someone gets hurt He can respond to medical stuff yeah they re First Responders It s a good idea Anybody else Can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody Would anybody that you know that works here already That s good he s too old his life would be long So the old sir will be able to be productive to society Think about that Anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about in support of communism Do you want that in your society or not No Why not Because Okay so freedoms are important to you Mr Malls Yes ma am Send Kyle to the office for a minute please He s in Miss Crane s room right now What core are y all in Because I told Mr Wayward where he was supposed to be and he said he was with you Uh he we re actually in 2nd he s with Miss Crane All right thank you OK you can resume Folks we re about I don t know Hey why should we keep the male professor What s the issue you have OK now this is just a question guys If someone s not fit does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society Nah they could be really smart OK they could be really smart But she s nine She s nine She s nine so are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run We re talking about the long run The long run so you got time So just consider all aspects just because maybe just because she has does she have anything to offer Let the group decide it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it If you want a male farmer say aye Aye If you want the male professional say aye Aye If you want the female scientist say aye Aye If you want the male preacher say aye Aye Definitely female nurse We already have a nurse We already have a nurse Who cares I do In case he dies But the female med student s only in second year she hasn t even been to the hospital It might go for four years Exactly We got the scientist and the nurse to help her Plus she d be off breeding Excuse me No offence You know we only got like thirty minutes We only have fifteen so Hey we re about 5 or 10 more minutes and then I m gonna stop you in groups and you ll listen If you have not managed to already make your decisions here s the key point here s the key point Still got a group talking you need to listen About five or ten more minutes you need to come down to your five you need to have the reasons why you chose the five and we re gonna share those and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn t choose Keep in mind Edna keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that s gonna hopefully flourish and I hope you re all taking people with uh that you know will make it But there s also you gotta keep in mind there s five people you re leaving behind that most likely is not gonna make it But you you re concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society OK OK start closing up in the next five or ten minutes about who you re choosing who you re not choosing Those radiation levels are getting high very high Over here especially I know really I kinda changed my mind about that Because she s cute You can t change times and down I m agreeing with that Say aye again if you want Aye Finally They wanna take cripple girl and I m saying He s still overruled I posed this question just a minute ago So this is so we can look at mass So we can look at it two ways one you re looking at She can t do anything she s gonna be hard to keep because someone will have to do it second way of looking at it she And she doesn t have her doctor Uh is that true Once she had a doctor OK and then what else Have you ever heard anything about Yup So what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a It didn t say that But again you re not saying that she is you can combine that OK continue on You need to start choosing maybe 3 or 4 of your 5 And why you re gonna take or why you re not gonna take em OK male professor too old He s too old Five minutes I m giving you five minutes Start making decisions But why do we need a policeman if we got a lot of money Hey I wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about And one person said well she has the potential to become any of these things here she has the potential to be any of those so it might something to consider We need extra little kids and she won t help us with no extra little kids Somebody s ready to go just about so you need to make sure you get your five choices 
 These colors What color is this Yellow oh my gosh did you find a lot of leaves that match this color No You forgot to do it Well let s do it right now Alright go ahead and put it there What other ones are yellow Mmm That s a yellow one Is that yellow Okay put it right there Let s see If we put these two together do they match in color no No so you might not want to put that one in Okay wow So put it here you ve already given it a check So now what I want you to do by looking at the sheet I want you to sort by size What does size mean If something is bigger If something is bigger or smaller Now which measurement which size are you going to sort by Big or little Big Okay so all your big leaves put them in the middle Okay You decide how you want to sort them So if you want to use both baggies that s okay If you want to just use one that s okay too Okay that s okay that s okay too I noticed that you haven t started sorting yet So which one do you want to sort by Or do you want to make up your own I like to do this Yeah color Color Okay so ok what color are you going to choose I m gonna choose brown Jennifer is that ok You have to ask your partner Sort by brown So put all the leaves that match the brown in your work space Ok let s see what s going on over here Ok well let me see this Let me see that please Ok we are going to work with partners I know sometimes it can be hard to work with partners because you re trying to make a choice and maybe one person wants to do one thing and maybe one person wants to do another so we re gonna work together to figure this out Well let s get working She s laughing How do you want to sort your leaves now Let s get our workspace in the middle I notice you already sorted by color so now how do you want to sort By shape Ask your partner if that s ok Ask your partner if that s ok Ok is this the shape you want to sort by Oh this is pretty tricky See if you have any more leaves that match this shape How can you describe this shape How can you describe that shape So you re going to look for ones that have little points So you re actually sorting by points Yes am I hearing that right So look at your leaves and look for ones that have teeny tiny points Look at your leaves so look at your leaves here Ones that have teeny tiny points It has points its very tiny Does it have points No no side points Yes does it have some side points Do you think that belongs here Oh really I loved how you used your magnifying glass to find those little details Keep on looking through yours Jennifer because I have a feeling that you are going to find some more Take a look at these points and take a look at these points You re sorting by points right Are those little points or big points Little or big Little Are they little like this Are you sure So you think this belongs here Okay Don t worry about your name for right now I ve noticed that you ve sorted by every way Now are you ready for the challenge Can you make up your own way to sort Something that we didn t talk about on Friday Oh I bet you could Yeah well let s think a little bit more Now I want you to look very very closely at these leaves What s something that s the same about some of them That s the question that you should be asking yourself What s the same about some of these leaves They have dots Really they have dots Remember we had colors up here Andrew just said something Some of these had dots Do you see dots on some of your leaves Yes do you think that s a good way to sort So wow see I thought you said you couldn t figure out another way So I want you to put all of the leaves with dots on your workspace Okay how are we sorting here That s okay The way you re doing it is perfect All you need to shoot for is to keep count of what you ve done so far So let me come to you I ve noticed that you had sorted by color so far Which one is next which one would you like to do next Okay which one do you want to do It s up to you Do you want to sort by big leaves Is that okay Monica Okay so look at your leaves and sort by size Now find all of your leaves that are big Uh oh does this one belong there Does this one belong there Okay wow Amazing I like how you re really looking at your leaves Absolutely that one s very big nice job I really love how children stopped working They put their hands up Friends can I share something that I noticed Is that okay When I was walking around I noticed children using their eyes and sometimes their hands to explore their leaves Some of you figured out new ways to sort your leaves And I can t wait for those kids to share their ways Some of you went ahead and you looked at what we talked about on Friday Which was also a really great way to use a resource in our room to help us sort I just want to remind everybody that your job right now is not to touch your leaves Your job right now is not to touch your leaves Your leaves are down Because it s important for scientists to stop what they re doing and share what they have noticed Let s take a peek This is a graph does anybody recognize this graph Does it look like something we already do What is it raise your hand if you want to share It kind of looks like you use something it s something we do every almost every day Brian Um the calendar Yes And what in our calendar sweetheart looks like that The weather Oh I love how you re thinking Absolutely right our weather calendar looks like this Today friends we re going to share how you sorted And then I m going to go ahead I m going to color in boxes and then at the end we re gonna see What was the most popular way to sort What was maybe not the most popular way and if anyone had a different way to sort Okay So just give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size Look at your sheet look at your sheet And give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size today Let s see And actually I m only going to ask one partner to put their thumb up Because I m only counting partners So one group two groups three groups four groups five groups six seven eight groups nine groups ten groups eleven groups twelve groups Uh oh Do I have enough spaces No Oh my gosh I ll have to add them Eleven twelve so there were twelve groups There s thirteen that wanted that sorted by this kind Mrs you forgot mine Okay anybody sort by shape today Anybody sort by shape today Okay keep your thumbs up One two okay One two three four five six seven eight nine ten Wow ten groups sorted by shape Mrs you keep forgetting mine Mrs you keep forgetting mine Okay friends before we continue going on with that did you sort by another way today Did you sort by another way that wasn t something we talked about on Friday Emma did you sort by a different way today Oh sorry you re two Joel and Emma I ll come to you What s another way you sorted Okay did someone sort by a completely different way that s not on your chart Andrew Dots Dots did anybody sort by dots today Yeah okay What s another way you sorted your leaves Catherine Counting the points Okay now that was a way that we sorted on our sheet but that s okay How s it different So you were looking for nine points okay So friends there s so many different ways you can sort and I just want you to put your hands down Because there s so many different ways you can sort and there s many more ways than just what we practiced today As scientists and mathematicians we re gonna continue sorting and looking for similarities things that are the same things and things that are different Give yourself a pat on the back Thank you so much friends for doing your best job today

see them Face forward Lights helper Where s my lights helper Claire Claire would you mind turning out our lights Okay Do we know what we re listening Yeah and watching for Okay Eyes forward I m going to be seeing who s doing their job Ready The wind is blowing my hair but then it s very strong today We decided to blow bubbles They re blowing away That s Oliver blowing bubbles too Oh Amy s bubble just blew away It was so windy the wind is making the bubbles The wind s pushing out the bubbles and then the bubble comes out We didn t even do anything All we did is hold up the bubble wand Whoa You can t see the wind but you can see what it s doing That looks like fun What are they doing My dad gave us some old sheets to tear up so we could make some streamers Is he having fun That s Oliver and the streamer just went in his face What are they doing Let s see what they re doing Let s watch I was pretending the streamers were the hair of this pig because the little knot is really shaped like a head and the rest of the stick is their body And if they have branches growing on them that s to me their hands and their legs or something All right It was very short Well did you enjoy that Yeah I want to see that again Good Go turn on our lights Again Now Oh we might watch it again later So let me see if you were listening and viewing our video I m going to check by answering these questions Now if you know the answer what are you going to do Raise your hand Raise your hand What weather did you see Let me see someone I haven t heard from Emily what type of weather did we see Blowing It was blowing what Bubbles Wind Wind Blowing wind What tools were the children using to observe the weather Bubbles Bubbles And what did they do They ripped the paper They ripped them and they put them on the stick Have we had a similar experience Yeah Yeah for the bubbles Yeah let me see who s let me see who I haven t heard from Clara what did we do We blowed bubbles We blew bubbles Did we have to go like this No Did we have to do that No What happened when we put it in the bubble solution and put it up What happened The wind blew it The bubbles blowed out All right So now we re going to do a think Pair share I want you to turn to your partner that you talked to yesterday Okay I want you to share how you observed the wind We had a lot of windy weather yesterday Talk to your partner about where you observed the wind Emily she ll be right back You be thinking Jacob what did you see yesterday Wind How did you see it What did it blow The trees It blew the bubbles the other day Collin what did you see Perfect I like that You used the tools we made in school Marcus Are you back All right we just got through watching our video talking about our wind observations Now I want you to tell me what effective speakers do I m going to call on some people I haven t heard from yet Marshall tell me one thing an effective speaker does Speaks slowly Speaks slowly All right let s see what else effective speakers do They keep their eyes on the audience Eyes on the audience just like mine are on you right now Bronwen show that you re listening Raven Show your work I want to see that beautiful work Who else has read Who can tell me another one Who have I not heard from today Who have I not heard from today You haven t Wesley Wesley what else should a good speaker do Volume up Huh Volume up Volume up We want to hear what you have to say All right Clara tell me something else Be still All right Oh you need to stand still Should you sway back and forth when you re presenting your work No No Okay Have we covered it all Yes Let s see Let s remind ourselves Look at your Audience Speak Slowly Stand Still Volume Up Show your Work Okay Now remember don t hold up your thumbs up sign until I ask if that person did these jobs My first speaker is Holland Holland will you please come up Okay Okay go ahead I can see the wind blow a horse s Huh Horse s what Tail Okay Did Holland look at the audience when she presented her work Yes What do you think Good Hold up those thumbs up signs We want to give her good feedback Put your thumbs up sign down Thank you Holland My next speaker is Alice Alice Thank you for choosing a safe path Come on Good All right Let s watch our speaker Remember I can see the wind blow grass All right Did Alice speak slowly Yes Thumbs up sign Awesome Put your thumbs up sign down My next speaker Yes Fran What do you want Wesley please come up Cathy just look through your window I know we re close today I can see the wind blow the roofs Did Wesley stand still Yes Yes Good job All right Thumbs up sign if he yeah if he stood still Good Our next speaker Sofia Sofia come up Okay let s start out like this Loudly I can see the wind blow Did Sofia have her volume up Yeah She did a much better job Let s give her those thumbs up signs Good job Oh I don t see everyone s Thank you Adam Good Thumbs up sign down Matthew Bashir I can Oh hold on Are your friends listening to you Let me see if you re remembering if your eyes are watching and your ears are listening Christopher we want to see you look at the speaker Turn your body this way please Thank you I can see the wind blow kites Very good Show your work Oh they ve already got those thumbs up signs Friends do you believe that he showed his work Is he showing everyone Good Why thank you Matthew What does that say Hmm Why is the What is that His kite is in the shape of a Star Star Isn t that beautiful I love those details Catherine your turn I can Oh hold on one second I m sorry to interrupt Eyes forward Eyes forward Good job I can see the wind blow my star I can see the wind blow leaves She wrote two sentences Show your work Very good Did Catherine look at her audience when she presented her work Yes Good Thumbs up signs Christopher Romley Emily we want to see your eyes up here Thank you Aiden Aiden All right Aiden we re going to do a quick check May I please have this It s okay Accidents do happen I just didn t want you to get hurt What get hurt Because you re holding it we want to be safe with our materials Criss cross Very good Aiden I love the details in your picture I can see the wind blow Down down the tree Show your work Nice Oh thumbs up signs He spoke very slowly 
 So who can tell me in this group who can remind me what is our objective What are we discovering today in science I d like to see a lot of volunteers Lindsey We re seeing what soil holds water better and We re seeing which soil holds water better What s the term for that Holds water Chris It s absorbing the water What s absorbing the water The clay and the sand absorb the water Very good So we re trying to figure out which absorbs more water Clay or sand today Very good Who can tell me what was the first step that you did in this project Cameron First we poured in the sand What did you pour the sand into We poured it into a funnel Okay What s that thing on the funnel It s a coffee filter It s a coffee filter Why do we need a coffee filter on the funnel Because when it s on the funnel it makes it so that the sand doesn t run through the funnel Okay All right What s the second step Can somebody tell me what the second step is Cameron said you dump the soil sample whether it was clay or sand into your funnel What s the second step Caleb The second second step is to pour in the water The second step was to pour in the water Who can tell me what the third step is What s the third step Chris You record how long it took for it to drip every last drop into the cup of water What s it The water The water Good You re recording how long it took for all of the water what s that word called What did that water do to get from here to the surface to the bottom of the cup Cameron It drained It drained Very good What are you measuring in Are you measuring in seconds Are you measuring in minutes In hours Lindsey Measuring in minutes with the seconds You re measuring in minutes with seconds Okay Can you tell me how long your clay is up to for draining out the water Two minutes and a half Two and a half minutes Good Can you tell me Cameron how long it took for your water to drain through your sand It took 28 seconds Twenty eight seconds Good job Keep up the good work I really like all the diagrams that I m seeing Lindsey you did an excellent job at paying very close attention and following the steps in step by step order You can give yourself a point for science Good job Ladies can you tell me did your sand hold water Yes It did hold water How did you know that Because it absorbs some of the water I poured it in here and it had into the water so the sand holds 11 milliliters of water Good So you re saying that the sand held 11 milliliters of water You said that when you poured the water in through the sand then you dumped something in this graduated cylinder What did you dump in this graduated cylinder We dumped all the water that was in there What s there In the cup So you dumped all the water that was in the cup after what What did the water do in order to get in the cup It drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So it drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So then you took your water and you poured it in your graduated cylinder Luana you said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11 milliliters Why did you do 40 minus 29 Because that s how you find out how much the sand is holding That s how you find out how much the sand is holding How did you know to start with 40 Because we poured 40 milliliters of water in the cup to start Oh To start you poured 40 milliliters of water in You took the water that you had to start and took away the amount that was left which you got 11 milliliters Very good Excellent Gentlemen what are you noticing about sand and water We re noticing about the sand this time it took us two minutes and eight seconds for it to stop dripping We started out with 40 milliliters and What did you do with that 40 milliliters of water We poured it into the strainer to drain it down into the cup and when we poured into the cylinder we had 28 and a half milliliters Very good How do you figure out how much water is in the sand What subtraction sentence would you do Forty minus 30 So you re rounding up You said you had to 30 Yes That s a very good choice You re going to do 40 minus 30 so that tells you how much water is in the sand which is One 10 Ten what Milliliters Ten milliliters Very good Do you think some of that water s still in the funnel Because this funnel is still dry This funnel feels wet Do you think some of that 10 milliliters of water is in this not funnel in this filter Yes Do you think so Why do you think that Because it s soaked and some of the water might have stopped in there because it was so thick and sandy And now it s a little bit thinner Keep up the great work Sam and Madison what are you noticing about water with your sand and water with your clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay Have you figured out yet which one holds more water Clay The clay holds more water If you were a gardener and if you were planting a garden what would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay Sand Why s that Because it drains water better and the drainage would get to the plants faster Okay So the drainage would get to the plants faster Where do the plants need the water Roots At the roots What do you think Madison I would do a mixture of sand clay and humus because mixed together it s loamy and loamy soil is good for the plants Great observation That s wonderful So you said you d mix all of them together because that would make a loamy mixture which would allow the gardeners to get the best soil for the plants to grow Very good Nice job What are you three noticing about water and sand and water and clay Water and sand it can absorb through the sand the water And through the clay it soaks and at four minutes You re almost at four minutes for your clay Wow What do you think this shows you about what happens on a rainy day whether it s outside in our soccer field Or what happens on a rainy day in your backyard Does anybody want to tell me what happens The clay it gets very muddy because the water is pouring down on it It might make a puddle because some of the soil on the ground can t hold itself so it might make a puddle Good So Matthew when you poured your water into your clay did you have a puddle at the top of your clay Yeah we had a puddle at the top of our clay because it was leaking little drops and it stayed on top of the clay We had to wait a long time till we could pour more water What stayed for a long time on top of the clay The water did because it didn t have small particle sizes so it was hard for the water to get through Oh so the clay has small particle sizes so it s hard for the water to get through Wow Good job What does that mean about the particle size for the sand It means that the particle for sand is bigger and it has more space for the water to drain through Good Excellent Did any of you draw diagrams of what your experiment set up looked like What it looked like I think you have a diagram on the previous page Did you draw a diagram Yes Okay What did your diagram show My diagram for sand shows that the water is going right through the funnel and it s pouring to the bottom And for my clay it s little drops because the clay is stuck together once it has water Good I can easily tell in your diagram which one s sand and which one s clay One suggestion that I can make to you though is I would like a few more labels If I were to never see this experiment before how would I know that this is sand and that this is clay So if you could label those for me and tell me what these drops are I don t know if they re water or or milk If you could do a little bit more labelling for me that would be excellent Good job Nice work Very impressive How long are you guys up to for your water being through your filter through your clay Five minutes and 45 seconds Five minutes and 45 seconds I can tell that both of you are working very hard And Xavier you re doing excellent job at staying in your seat the whole time You can give yourself a point right now for being on task Nice job Good What are you noticing about sand clay and water I noticed that the clay held less water than the sand and I was really surprised by that because I thought that water can go through sand fast So you were really surprised because you didn t think water would go through sand that fast And how much water did your sand hold Our sand held 11 milliliters Eleven milliliters Good And how much did your clay hold do you know Five Held five milliliters Wow What number sentence did you do in order to figure out how many milliliters were in the clay and how many milliliters were in the sand We did 40 minus however the milliliters were left in the cup Okay And why did you do that Because we had 40 to begin with and we needed to find out how many were left and I forgot You forgot Kendall can you help her out We got 29 in this and it began with 40 So we had to do 40 minus 29 Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters Milliliters Good Remember millimeters is when we re using rulers and milliliters is when we re measuring water Okay Excellent job Which soil would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay I would garden with both of them so I could get a loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers Okay So you would mix them together so that you could get a loamy mixture What about you Kendall I would do sand because water can get through it easily So water can get through it easily Why would that matter Because the soil and everything else and the grass and everything needs water but if you use clay it just stays on top and it can t get water Very good Excellent Looks like you girls are ready to move on to your graphing What are we going to graph What are we graphing today How much water is in the 
 So what about this part Is this any different or is this part the same as last time It s different because Well Let s let Rileen talk Chris It s different because it s wider and it got right to here and the other one came up to there It s like six more it s like ten more centimeters than last time Okay So once you guys finish with your observations you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta See this part is completely dry It s pretty much almost half Water s above the side Watch that watch that it s gonna fall Look at that It s like a boat going down a waterfall That was sand I know The water has stopped going One minute s passed Thirty Oh There s a start to get ready It s not done playing It s still not done Well the water Look at this look at this I know we re still dry There s a pool of water at the end There s a pool of water at the end Look at this there s a dent there s a dent Oh wow Right here s dry Okay why do you guys think this part didn t get any water Because it probably went under So Cameron says it went under Xander what were you saying It was going too fast and it didn t it was probably right here so it didn t decide to go all the way over here and it went right here It formed a lake right here It went the easiest route So it s got eight or nine minutes So now ten nine minutes Is water still draining Yeah the water s still there When are you guys gonna decide when the end time is When this goes There s been nine minutes right And the water is dripping Last time we got 15 minutes The water s dripping into basin Last time we got 15 minutes So how does it all compare Because um it compares because it s almost the same and look at it like poured a pool or something Cameron you were saying this one is almost the same Like it took the same amount of time No No No I m saying it s getting there No the other one s longer because it drained a bigger whole Yeah So Elondra how was the time different for this one How it was like similar Let s hear what Elondra says This one went faster This one went faster Yeah way faster So you re saying it s similar not too different But Elondra s saying it went faster Do you agree with her Yeah and the deposition it s like way over here Way across there You guys are I think pretty much done with your water draining now Okay so Nine or ten minutes and it s done So you guys want to record your end time No no it s still going It s okay if there s still a little bit of water left in Once it stops draining you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements Where do we get the toothpicks Don t we have to know what time it is 10 30 right Was this when the chocolate melts When s the chocolate melt Elondra What It looks like chocolate So are you guys ready to start taking your measurements Yeah Why don t you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you and I ll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing Yeah I think the widest part is right here Can I do the poking Huh Can I do the poking You guys have your measuring tape out We have to go get the measuring tape Tape that back up Here our widest part is right here Widest part is that No no no you re not supposed to poke it How long is that It s about to here Okay we got what we need Go from centimeters Centimeters Aw Cameron Cameron you messed it up That s not our longest part Our longest part is this Okay we have to redo it Wait where does we start Right here Here you do the poking Don t poke it into the thing but how deep is it Here grab it No you re not supposed to do that Remember what she did Okay this right here It s about three centimeters Three centimeters So depth of straight channel is three centimeters Okay what do we measure next Okay time to do the width How much was it Three centimeters Three Okay What s the widest Where s the measuring tape Around six centimeters How much Six Six centimeters Six Okay now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel It s all this it s all from right here It s from here to here You guys we need the tape measure Yeah width from here to here No it s this long I ve got it with my fingers This long It s about 15 No it s 14 and a half No that s 15 Yeah 15 Oh yeah 15 Same with the other one 15 It goes all the way to the end Yeah length Okay 29 How many 29 Yeah and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick So right here Right there yeah Okay where s the time Okay so can you hold that there How much is it Five centimeters How many Five Five c m Okay width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So right here We re gonna actually move to here No no width Oh width Looks about 11 centimeters maybe 11 centimeters Alright length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So now we re measuring that Here you can do it So what re you guys working on measuring now Length We ve got a long length 27 28 28 yeah 28 centimeters Jorge you can measure Now what do we measure Depth of soil dropped at end of the Wait what was it 28 Depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick I m letting Jorge do it Okay Jorge you can do this one So maybe poke it here Poke it in there Now put your finger down Put your finger down where it is Slide it down until you feel the dirt Good Bring it over to Kendra So you can kinda see the dirt right there That s not even a centimeter You start here Okay That s not even a centimeter That s three millimeters So we round it down to zero centimeters Okay Zero Okay we re all done No we still have to Work on your bird s eye view picture in your notebook Up in the big can Oh no they re over there Okay The same bird s eye view or a different view That s what I was going to I m especially gonna draw in here because that s really interesting Really interesting Did Cody just go get something Yes he did Oh my gosh he s so nice So did you guys finish taking your data Yeah we re gonna do our bird s eye view Before you guys look at your bird s eye view I want you to share What d you guys find from your data So let s look at your data tables for a minute Okay It kind of made like a cave No right here Yeah So I see the difference right here In the depth of the stream channel the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river What was more Like in centimeters so one centimeter off So Alejandro s looking at the depth of the stream channel and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep So last time it was actually deeper How about which one was wider The rushing river So the rushing river made a wider stream channel Yeah I think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in It basically didn t spend enough time going in it basically just went Yeah and it made it more curved inish and stuff Okay Jorge what d you notice I noticed that right here it made a little cave and I think something like water I think there was a little whirlpool there Yeah there was There were a bunch of whirlpools Yeah there were doubles There s one right here and here So I think it broke the water I saw one little whirlpool right there and another one over here I saw one here So the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places Yeah I think it s cause it curves like that so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water s coming through Yeah so the water s So what about the delta The deposition How is this different than your first experiment Oh my gosh it was five centimeters bigger Five centimeters bigger What d you notice Jorge The biggest part was that it was only this part right here Okay Yeah that was the longest part that was part of it all So Cody I noticed that this time how deep was your delta Our delta which would be to get that soil Yeah Zero centimeters So does that mean there s no delta So how did you guys come up with zero Cause it was three millimeters so we had to round down Okay so you guys have your data And the length of the soil It was a lot wider wasn t it Yeah the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger It was from the end right here and it continued down So you guys remember we re gonna take this data Someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here Oh put more of the earth material in Yeah And see what it would be like if you added more material Okay maybe that would be a question we could investigate Maybe the delta would be thicker because there s not enough room for all of it You know why I m asking you that Because I think it would be deeper because right here it only makes little ones here but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space Okay So you think these channels might be bigger Yeah If there was more earth material What if we made an even bigger hole Oh so you re wondering if it was an even bigger flood what might happen Maybe that would be a hole like this big Yeah you guys are doing that thing that scientists do after they do an investigation they start asking more questions I wonder what if we tried this So you guys have got your data so we ll be ready to put this in the class data table right Find our averages probably on Thursday Right now you guys are going to be working on you want to make sure you get the runoff sample draw what that looks like today we ll see what it looks like when it settles out later and then you guys are going to work on your bird s eye view and think about where s the humus where s the gravel where s the clay so you can add that into the picture Hey guys I m gonna like Yeah I was thinking the same thing like rip this up Whoa there s the biggest Oh that s cool Ms Maher it made a big dip I m guessing that some water s still down there 
 I don t want a straight line No I like curves Yeah a lot Because the friction in the air Yeah Pushes it and the gravity going on the next turn I think it s because there s like a big wall and that s a small little plane and everything has gravity You need to pull on the string And the reason why it s not going that way is because that wall will stray them away The wings get cool What was your longest throw How long was it Oh it was It was mine and it was probably one two three four five six Five No it s six One two three four five six Into the six but not before the six Oh yes into the six Alright Go over there check that out 38 Four hundred 538 centimeters Yeah Let s put how many meters Five meters Write 538 But why did because fliers don t go into the wall Because Everything has a little bit of gravity There s not a whole lot of gravity where it would just go Yeah and then that doesn t have a lot of gravity but I mean I can see that but he threw it high and it went up to the wall right there But it kind of did like that But it didn t really smash I mean it didn t go and stick Yeah it didn t go Gravity pulled it but it wasn t going to hold it there Yeah It s got more force on it Yeah I think there s more gravity up there than right here because that s higher and it s closer It s like it has a lot more gravity What has more gravity Up there Had more pull I think the reason why the sticks were going and the straw was going this way is because everything has a little bit of gravity And the wall And the wall it like a lot bigger than that stick and it s gravity that s pulling it there but it doesn t have enough gravity where it will just be like It s not like this Okay so if everything has a little bit of gravity what is the major gravity pull though that is bringing it down The Earth The Earth because That s why like if we threw this that s why That s why it chops Okay this one went it went three meters This one covered straw with paper and this one glides It s a lot bigger So when it went like here it went all the way down to the Yeah it s faster because it s bigger and this one s smaller and it doesn t go far Glider the other one s probably bigger This one s also flat so it s got a better chance to glide Yeah That one s like round and bigger and it doesn t flop on the and it doesn t go like far When you throw it it doesn t like when it goes it doesn t go far but this one like it ll go far What do you think would happen if we put a paperclip on either the front or the back It would help It would lay it a little bit down It would go a little bit down because it s it has more weight it ll go down If you put a paperclip on it like a paperclip s not that heavy but it would make it like when we fly it it goes up in the air and then comes back down and floats down That s why they re so short What makes it come down Gravity Okay And like you put a paperclip on it it ll come down Because the paperclip is heavier than the straw What if you put it on the back It would it would It would kind of slow it It would be like that Okay can you think of What about this one What if we put the paperclip on this one It would It wouldn t feel It would get worse If we put the paperclip on here then it would get all messed up because if it s flat and it s trying to It has weight it will just go Uh huh right That one when you fly it before we got the paperclip it goes high before it comes down But when we put the paperclip on it it goes straight down like that And like without the paperclip without the paperclip on it it will go like it will go like an ocean With the paperclip on there it would go farther It would go farther and then it ll fall just down like that but not go like that This one let s try this one See that one goes a lot farther And it probably goes farther because I put a lot of force on it If you even put a lot of force on this one it will go down because it flies like I threw it like that and it just flies off because it s the gravity And you throw that one it goes farther Okay so gravity makes it come down faster than the glider It makes it go down because if you just throw it without the paperclip it won t it will just come down because of gravity _ Yeah the straw one is going like that And then it just goes like see how it flips down But with the paperclip it ll go farther Like that Tyler what were you saying about the air Do you think that has a do you think that makes a difference in what Mary Morgan is saying this one kind of floats and then comes down Go talk about that See the air The air feels like windy in here It would push it and then it would It would go like this Yeah like that And it would just push It would just push it towards like where everything was Yeah and this one with the paperclip goes really far And that paperclip the reason it went far without the paperclip is because air pushed it and force What is that force called When you push it Remember it s called The thrust The thrust that s right So the thrust when you push the plane made a difference is that what you said Could you change the one with the straw is there any changes that you could make that you think would make it fly further Talk about that as a group Put two paperclips One on the front and one on the back Put the lighter one on the back Let s try that I bet it will It might go farther too Okay now push We have a paperclip on it and we re going to see if it goes farther the second time I think I bet it will go I bet it goes a lot longer That s fine Well It went to 10 It went to 10 Okay so I want you to discuss in this group I want you to discuss what you found when you threw when you tested this with the paperclip on it Just talk about that together Well So when there s air I think when they closed the air up it went in and back out But but but tied together So if you like flip off The paper clip The air like if you could do this and turn off the air it would go further But if you take off of it I mean if you it won t make it that far It will just be like The paper clip the straw it does help Yeah about the same as this one without I wonder what that one s like with paperclips Me too I want to try it This is my prediction I think it s on an angle I think that s going to go further I don t know because they don t have no air stream to hold it I think it will go farther I don t See Well you didn t put a lot of force on that one Well we all have to try But I still think it went the farthest but I think I think it s going to go farther Nope Well it went farther than you It went But I mean it didn t go You all tried it with this didn t you all Let me try it this way I tried it with that I tried it with that side It all went to the yellow but But it didn t Strong enough So what did we find out back here That it puts more weight on it so it goes What puts more weight This little paperclip The paperclip puts more weight to that one and it s not going to nose dive But I was standing right here and mine hit that wall And that s without the paperclip And then you put the paperclip on there it doesn t go near as far Why did that make a difference Was your throws the same Did you use the same amount of force What happened Mine felt like I was using the same force I think it s just because that since there isn t any air space on that one What do you mean airspace I mean like the air can t go through this Yeah like that s a straw it has a hole It s just putting more weight on that one so that s just going to go boop If you use this one and put the paperclip right here it s going to cut off the air coming in right here And that s going to go further Oh you re took off the air of the straw And that makes it go further Why does that Because the air in the straw is pulling it down because it s like Do you know what that s called Gravity Well the gravity but what about the air when the air is coming in Friction Oh friction Friction the air is causing friction Okay The air s slowing it down And also the air Okay now I want you to think about if you change this plane in any way what changes could you make to it to make it fly further We could cut it up Wrap around and then have that like this Yeah I think that s set to have the same throw Because actually having That one can go farther but the paperclips on it it won t fly further But if you put paperclips on this one it d probably go farther Put some paperclips on there Because paperclips add more weight Yeah and it lets it go further Here Tyler you want to throw That went two 
 Most friends have finished their first trials I wanted to talk real quick about what s happened on your first trial Who wants to share what happened on your first three trials And I want to know was it something that you predicted would happen Cody At first we kinda got a little it kind of got a little complicated Since you came around it fixed it a little Why was it complicated cause the rest of the group didn t see your experiment Why was it complicated Because it keep turning and the wax paper was What kept turning The car Your car kept turning Yeah and the wax paper kept coming off and turning it So it was a little complicated So after you got it fixed and after I helped you then what did you find out That it was kind of easy to do So did your measurement did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be When it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance We thought it was gonna I thought it was gonna go very far Because that s a little bit slicker Because that it s slippery Well I was listening to another group talk about something I think it was at Bhavana s group raise your hand if you re in Bhavana s group And really deep had really good observation Because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too But you told me something about the surface that we were testing on I said the the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough So do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we re testing on being rough if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car s going to travel give me a thumb s up I think that makes a difference Lucy why do you think it makes a difference The carpet there s a feel of bumps if you could feel it and the wax paper is slippery So that s how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast like if they have wheels or something it makes stuff fast That s true So as we get ready for our next test you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial But I want you to predict now that you ve kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel looking at your information your measurements I want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface And we re choosing to use the shelf liner today The black shelf liner in your tub Do you think the car s going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial We may only get through one trial And that is okay Alright but I want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start So Lawson what are you gonna do first before you test Get in a group meeting and sit down and meet Yeah and talk about your predictions first That s what good scientists do They re always making really good predictions about what they ve observed Alright Go I m setting the timer I think it will go really bumpy well not really bumpy but a little bumpy And it might go just a little less than the smooth I think that it will go slower because the surface it s really bumpy and one time I went on this bumpy slide and I did not go down very quickly Don t worry about recording the information right now but we ll record in a little bit I think they re gonna go a little bit far I bet slower Hey you can t pick off of me I think that it s gonna go farther and faster I think it s gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster I think it s gonna go a little bit slower I think it s kind of gonna go since it s bumpy it s gonna slow it down I think it was gonna go farther Group meeting s over So you think it s gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper No I think it s going a little bit slower but still a little fast like medium So you don t think it s gonna change that much why do you think that Cause it doesn t feel too too bumpy It doesn t feel too too bumpy she s making a really good observation What do you think Jaylin My predict is when you put the car on it it s gonna kinda go medium it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast and then when it gets to the carpet it s gonna go slower and then it s gonna turn It s gonna go a lot slower and then it s going to turn I think like that fast Okay Not too fast not as fast as the wax paper Go ahead and test but let s think about your setup here Before you move this let s look at your setup As the car rolls what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug What might happen It might get stopped Remember the car s going to continue to move until something makes it stop So what might you want to do with your ramp We might want it to be here so it will go straighter But it might bump into the black box It may well you know the rug is going to I don t mean there but I mean I know what we could do we could do it this way so it won t crash Well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way Javier could you go get us some tape It may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape Try it and see Let s try it without some Yeah it doesn t even need tape Who s the task manager here Me Look out he s doing the first test I think it should be Jaylin Okay Jaylin now do you test sideways we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn t agree And you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference Then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same Javier can you move out of the way You ready Now wait a minute wait a minute Cause I bet you probably got his on tape Jaylin show me how you did that again go get the car Watch what he did with his popsicle stick Cause I hadn t seen that before Do it just like you did the first time What did he do with his popsicle stick He flipped it down Do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up Why might it make a difference Olivia Because it might when you put it down you re putting it down fast and I bet it makes the car go a little bit faster And it gives it some force Did it give it more force So Jaylin is this surface the same as this surface Is this the same as this Yes I think Is this popsicle stick the same as this here No So if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy No So what do you need to do with the popsicle stick Raise it up You might want to raise it up next time Alright Try it again I ll come back and see if you guys are ready One two and go Wow that was great Now let s start measuring Now we re gonna start measuring Okay Okay one two No Tessa s gotta do that One two three ready Oh my gosh we were right Our first prediction is one two three four five six seven eight It s eight Oh my gosh Why s it eight And ours keeps getting a mess up I predicted eight too see I predicted seven mostly We got eight cubes on this one Eight cubes really Before we clean up I would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far Quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting I m gonna come around and be watching Quick quick quick It s almost time for us to go About what you learned What you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used the shelf liner What did you learn from what you tested I learned that the bumpy surface made it go that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster How do you know that Because when we use the smooth it went further How far did it go It went about eight cubes No I think it actually went seven I don t know we didn t put the lines behind it 36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes So that makes it the point where bumpy is slower So 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy The shelf liner I think it was seven on the bumpy Big difference isn t it Is that what you predicted No I didn t predict eight I predicted 16 No I didn t predict on the bumpy but I predicted I predicted one and I got the right answer for it on smooth Alright Well you guys have two more trials to do so we ll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three Alright Go ahead and get cleaned up We already cleaned most of them first Well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub You can go ahead and record your data but we re gonna get cleaned up Go ahead and get cleaned up Alright push the red button you can push the red button Mary come over here Tell us what you learned Okay Mary come over here I learned that different surfaces can make something different whatever you re testing make it go fast and slow Mary what did you learn I learned mostly the same thing except when we did that you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet It makes this go faster than the carpet which makes a difference Yeah Jaylin what did you learn I learned if you put the car on this it s gonna go a little bit faster If you put it on this it s gonna go a little bit almost fast And it s gonna stop and go slower and that s why it went right there Okay does anybody have anything else Javier what did you learn Well I learned that if it s smoother it s quicker But if it s a little bumpy it s slower That s it Alright everyone put your things in the bucket 
 So how would you describe that Can you find the exact spot where that is in the text where you can find those So you basically have found two character traits to describe to me right You guys have discovered that he can be what What was one of them again Jealous Sad Jealous Or sad So I want you to find that evidence If you want to make those claims any of those are great ideas But now you have to dig a little bit deeper into the text and see if you can find this Can you find examples and see OK Keep sharing You re doing a great job Toby wanted to play Because Toby was kinda jealous because Bouncer was outside by himself Didn t want to Nobody didn t and a little kid wanted to go outside the house Well I think he s thinking this himself Because he was thinking about what the other That s Toby So he s kinda jealous because he s talking to the other little dog and every single time he wants to play ball with him But he doesn t want to And the thing is the lady said it in the story it made it sadder than it usually would be sad That sometimes the stories make it seem so sad so good that that can feel So here where it says Why does Andy need a new dog Oh wait Why does Andy need a new dog wondered Toby He already has me Toby sighed and laid down Beside the dog Maybe Andy doesn t love me anymore They had to make it so that what happened and actually it s sad what happened It s not that it s sad but it s not so so sad but they make it like sad Toby wanted Toby wanted to play ball and he got a new dog and forgot I was about to Well he didn t really forget about Toby because he still bought Toby his food I know Toby wanted to play ball but when Andy came he got a new dog And then for the rest of the day Andy was playing with his new dog And Toby felt left out I say we put left out somewhere He s so sad jealous and left out So Toby wanted to play ball with Andy but when Andy How do you spell Andy A N D Y Andy Andy Where do you see Oh yeah When Andy told him he wanted to play ball Where are you Andy Andy Toby wanted to play ball but when Andy came he had a new dog And you spelled with a silent I think with the Andy Another dog A new Like this one Another dog No it s not Well whatever Who wants to Just write Just write I put Toby was jealous because of Bouncer Maybe we can put because he wanted more attention That s how my sister is She wants more attention We re not talking about your sister We re talking about Toby So Toby was jealous Toby was jealous because a dog s there Because Toby was a dog and Bouncer just came along and he didn t like him He s jealous No We have to write a reason why he s jealous I know Then we have to do part of the test Part of the test Did you guys agree on a character trait that he was at the beginning Jealous Jealous Jealous Do you have at least one example and maybe two Do you have an example Joaquin I m going to put Toby wanted more attention but Bouncer got more attention Do you have an example of why he wanted more attention I have one Can you find it Oscar When he was like maybe Bouncer doesn t love him anymore I only said that Can you find that So when you write it when you explain it can you find that part and maybe quote it There s another reason When they came through the driveway he got all And then when he came back he lay So that s like too many things Toby was jealous cuz Toby was jealous cuz Bouncer got more attention instead of Toby No Yeah Oh right here In the middle Toby since nobody What paragraph is that Paragraph nine He wondered if Andy had forgotten all about him Do you know why he paid more attention to Bouncer Because he s a little puppy And little puppies need more attention than big puppies Because little puppies don t know what to do I know And they re not even trained They have to train them more For like three months Yes That s why he needs more attention than Bouncer yeah Toby needed Because Toby really knows how to And he knows that s an old dog And you can see all the wrinkles That s how the dogs are Yeah those dogs have wrinkles when they re big already But they re still young OK Toby was jealous because Bouncer What did you write So I have In the beginning was Toby When Andy had a puppy he liked Bouncer more than Toby Maybe And in the beginning Andy was showing the puppy opening Opening the puppy and showing it to Toby Yes That s how he was like nervous Jealous Yeah jealous And selfish Yeah That s what I put in the beginning And then Toby Remember the part when he got the little ball Right Yeah and he was being jealous Yeah Bouncer Because he was a new one And the old one was Toby And the part when Andy closed the door in Toby s face and he let him outside Then he felt loner I believe that Toby was getting Bouncer Because they would stay together and they slept the whole night together So they were being friendly Yeah like starting to Yeah Another thing that Bouncer was new And another thing Toby was old So Andy was used to Bouncer And Bouncer and Toby And that s I think what Toby about It s Bouncer You know how the fence went to Bouncer They get a kinda middle something Yeah That s what I think When they started to get Toby showed Bouncer how to catch the ball that s when they started to become friends And the climax is when Andy he throw the rubber ball and told Bouncer to go and fetch it but he just sit there and then yeah Then Andy called Toby to go and show him how to pitch the ball Okay Oh almost part of the end is when the puppy that is Bouncer becomes crying and then Andy took the puppy to Toby Yeah in the beginning I was getting like selfish May I interrupt for a second so you guys it looks like you ve developed the beginning pretty well and you found examples right Have you talked about the ending yet and how he was at the end I see you re on the back page How does Toby change at the end Have you guys talked about that part yet What s his character trait at the end of the story We talked about the Okay so who was working on that part Was somebody working on that part Yeah was there a trait that you picked for him at the end When the little puppy Bouncer started crying and Andy took the little puppy Bouncer when Toby How did Toby change then How do we describe Toby then Happy Happy yeah can you give an example of now that he s happy He s happy why Because he just thinks anymore that Ohhh Can you come up with another reason maybe together if you guys can look for another example as to why at the end of the story Toby is happy Can you look and see if you can find one I think that Toby in the ending is kind Is kind Okay can you come up with an example and share it with them in the scene And then maybe you guys can come up with a consensus on one that you agree Or you can write two different things right You don t all have to write the same thing One of you can write he s kind and one of you can write he s happy as long as you have what as long as you have what Your reason Your reason absolutely So share that other example Share that other example too I think I ve got he s kind Maybe because he s going to be kind to Bouncer because he s still like a little puppy and he doesn t know how to do stuff I think Yeah in the end when he said for me at the end he was getting kind of happy because Andy told Bouncer to Andy told Toby to to get the yellow ball You know the yellow ball Yeah And Bouncer was kind of tired and everything because he s he s small and Toby he catched it and they were playing yeah and they were getting happy and Toby in the end at that part he was used to liking Bouncer now Mm hm At the climax At the climax it was when It was when Toby When Andy told Toby to show Bouncer how to fetch the ball and then started fetching the ball and then he started to play and Bouncer and Bouncer danced on his bed Bouncer tried Okay 
 Our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column what I learned in the KWL chart Okay So that s our goal Our goal is to find the answers to draw a conclusion to our month long experiment Before we do that why don t we take another measurement I would like you to measure your plant if you have any And I would like you to count the number of leaves on your plant on one of them Go ahead Scientists take your ruler Take your ruler and measure I like the way some of you are holding your rulers It s great that you put the lower number down when you measure Great If it helps you can pick up your plant Okay After you have your measurement and the number of leaves make sure you count the numbers the leaves too you may put your plant down After you put your plant down I know you are ready to continue Could you touch your head with your empty hands Good job John Touch your head with your empty hands Wonderful I see that you re ready right Katie Put your hands down I also took pictures of your experiment Your pictures will serve as data That means the information you collected This group picture were from the people who conducted the experiment to see if seeds would grow with soil water and sunlight Sunlight We have air all around us so we all have air I would like you to use good listening ears Day one Day 11 That s what it looked like Day 18 day 24 and day 32 We even have a ruler here a primary ruler that s easy for kindergartners to use Now looking at the data and your pictures What do you think the conclusion is if you did this experiment If you planted the seeds you planted your seeds with soil water and sunlight could you please raise your hand Good we have some eager participants Could you please come up here with your experiment and a ruler and explain to us My experiment was if plants will grow with sun soil and water and I put them near the windowsill Why did you put your cup near the windowsill To get some sunlight So your seeds received sunlight Did you water your seeds Yes I did Okay And you did put soil Yes in the cup Okay What do you think your conclusion is If plants will grow in sun soil and water And what is your answer Um Did your seeds grow Yes Did you take a measurement Yeah May we see how tall they are How tall are they One inch Did you see how Kieran measured his plants He has the end with the lower number touching the base of the plant That s good scientist Now how many leaves do you have on some of them Four leaves And how many did you have last week Two Two So what do you think is happening They re growing They re growing because you have more Leaves Wonderful Great job scientist And now let s look at the next experiment boys and girls This one is planting seeds without water Did seeds or plants grow without water I would like you to look at the data This is your data just in case you don t remember Sometimes we don t remember what we did but pictures help us Day one day 11 day 18 day 24 day 32 Hmmm I wonder what the conclusion is Oh John you want to come up and share Great Take your experiment and your ruler And I really love the way Thalia listened My experiment was if plants will grow without water And I put sun soil I gave it sun and I put soil and I never gave it water How did you give it sunlight I put it by the windowsill Okay so what is your conclusion My conclusion is plants will grow without water Will grow or won t grow Won t grow Very good Thank you Thank you very much young scientist Great job And let s look at the next experiment Did seeds grow without soil Here s day one Again scientists look at the smart board Day 11 day 18 and day 32 Now who did this experiment We would like you come on up Rachel Bring up your experiment and tell us all about it I did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil And I put seeds water in it and I put it by the window And I gave it sun And they didn t grow What did you not use Soil You did not use soil And where are your seeds By the window They re in your cup right now In my cup Uh huh Would you mind showing the class what you have there Tilt it down Boys and girls take a peek This is what Rachel s seeds I can t see Okay So now what is your conclusion Rachel Seeds won t grow without soil Very good Thank you scientist We have nothing to measure in Rachel s cup And the last one Oh boys and girls this is a very interesting one I really would like you to look up here Look at the data first Did seeds or plants grow without sunlight A lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight But look at this one Day one Do you have anything No No Day 11 No Day 18 look at the number Look at the numbers on the ruler Day 24 I want you to look at your data And day 32 Well that s some interesting experiment I know some of you did this one Quite a number of children If you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly Juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like Come on up Okay John you re going to show Juliana what a good listener you are okay Go ahead buddy I planted seeds without sun And I put them in the closet Did you cover your seeds with soil Yes So your seeds have soil Soil You watered them Watered them Every week you watered them And And no sun And you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in The closet In the closet and the closet has no Sun Has no sunlight It has no windows Right John Now Juliana tell the class if you ever had any sprouts I did have sprouts And what do you think happened They died How tall were your sprouts at one point One inch One inch and why do you think they died Because they had no sun And do you think the sun is important for plants to grow So what is your conclusion No seeds won t grow without sun Very good Good job scientist You may go back Now boys and girls I m going to ask you to think about your experiment Think about what your question was What you wanted to find out And the steps you took to do your experiment And you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out You may say What was your question Or What do you want to find out And here s a big question mark And after your partner answers then you may ask What did you do What steps did you take And at the end we will like you to ask your partner What is your answer How did you know that s the answer They have to tell you their evidence what they used to tell you the answer Okay now turn to your partner and talk to each other Remember how we work as partners What did you find out What was your question My question was Take turns Gabby take turns Boys and girls let s take 30 more seconds If you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free Okay boys and girls turn around Please put your hands on your lap so I can see your empty hands Alright Let s look at the answers again Our whole experiment and let s look at the questions Will seeds grow without water What do you think No If you don t think seeds will grow without water shake your head Great Cameron will seeds grow without water No No good Okay next question Will seeds grow without sunlight No Let me see you touch your ears if you don t think seeds will grow without sunlight Okay let s see Will they Cameron No Touch your ears so I know you understand Next one will seeds grow without soil Yes or no Yes No Will seeds grow without soil NO No Touch the ground touch the rug Okay great The last question Katie is will seeds grow with water sun and soil Yes Good Then make some rain drops Make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil 
 How do you know How do you think it might be different Okay maybe Ethan goes here Measure yours and let s see And which one do you think you re going under I don t know Okay all right Okay well you all listen to him listen to him You all talk about it You talk to them I m gonna walk around It s my turn EJ Okay let him do the writing Why are you taking them out of that one Okay and what are you trying to make it do Balance Okay balance Let s see you trying to make it balance Okay We need to put it right there Okay Did you balance it now Okay so what do put in that point I m going to scoot this just a little it And then you write it down good How did you know it was balanced Good You said which one was heavier here Okay why did you say Think you can do that one How did you know it was balanced Is it balanced What about that At first which one was balanced Because why It was heavy okay Okay so how many of those are I think it was one more Okay you re put it in You ll put what in this one And the number of crayons you all used You had another object that was moving Look right here You think their eraser didn t move What you all gonna test next Did you even measure that one And I ll come back Alright what are you all doing here Do you think if you did the scissors and Matthew did the scissors do you think it would measure the same Let s do it Okay Let s do it one at a time What s happening You guys can t measure try this one Here s my question If Matthew blows the paper clip is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip What do you think You don t think so Why not Matthew you blow Okay all right so remember that okay Now Weslee I want you to test it You said you thought it would go different See if you can make a difference Yeah why did it do something different What s that that you re blowing out Air Air and what is it Gas Gas good All right you all can go ahead and finish measuring I saw Ella trying Now if you and Ella both try to blow on that do you think it s going to move Why don t you think it s going to move You think it s too heavy And you don t have enough breath Try it and see See if you all both do it if you can get it to move You re going red in the face and it s going away Did you all think it was going to move You all didn t think it was How did you find this What d you do Counted Okay counted and what are you working on right now The colors Okay which one do you have to count now Which one do you have there This one and what is that one What is that one A solid a liquid or the gas Solid A solid how are you going to find out What are you gonna do Look at this You re going to look at those can you count those I m gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph okay You re doing good Okay Okay can you come over here and count You might have to get out of your chair you have lots of them One two three four five six seven eight Eight Five six seven eight Check your numbers and you checked to make sure All right whatcha going to do now Tally Tally them okay think you all can do that Okay you need help putting it on remember which one is the total How did you know that so quick I heard you started counting and then what did you do You found it quickly You remembered from that okay How else could have known that fast Go down there Go down there okay good 
 What It s a dark color So what does that mean We think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster Keegan how are you going to figure out how much it weighs Maybe it will melt faster because the water What about that explain your thinking Because You ve stolen her even Now we got to count it One two No now you re taking them all Three we got to count four five six Here Seven eight nine 10 11 12 Freeze for just one second Let s switch and have the boys keep on You stopped at 20 Boys finish counting They stopped at 20 finish counting 21 22 23 24 But they re not counting they re just putting it in It s not working They re just putting it in in the same time So freeze gentlemen So how do you think you could fix that Put it back in You might want to try to remeasure Definitely want to Miss T look Guys we need to take a bunch of it out because it s not really getting weighed You might need to use something heavier Oh remember you re not supposed to touch that nob on the back That s not how you how would you figure out how to weigh it What happened What s going on Daniel Tell me what the problem is It has too much oh sorry It has too much water in it Yeah Well can we change that scientists No What can we change We can take out a lot It s too heavy It was reaching on that side Six halves This is heavier Wait say that again Brayden What did I just hear you say I said it s heavier This is heavier than the blocks so we put more in Oh Yeah we re going to put more in Oh way too much way too much Whoa look Uh uh Ms Teacher Ms T I think it s six and a half What is six and a half The measure Oh is that your predication that s your what That s my hypothesis Oh how are you going to find out if it s true What do we do Can you maybe explain to Teagan what she needs to do Just balance it They re like working on it There we go got it Got it Daniel what were you saying We were going to like We just figured out how much blocks it weighs Hang on it ll get there So what did you discover We discovered we had we discovered we had to take We had to take one two three four of the blocks out Five Five of the blocks out to make it weigh So how much does it weigh So let me count the blocks One two three four Do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn t fall Five six seven eight nine ten How many does it weigh Okay I ll start wearing this I mean I ll start writing it No I got it What are you doing there Abigail Well I m weighing and it s not showing up yet What are you using that tool for What tool This tool To see how cold it is So did you already weigh it We have to hold it from the top Oh so do you think it s going to weigh more now that you taped that to it What s your prediction with that Do you have a prediction I have a prediction that it might be really cold And that s going to tell you that But have you weighed yours yet No And it s going to turn to ice So but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it ll change how much it weighs I think it will actually change how much it weighs Can you explain your thinking Because because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much One pound it was so we should probably get the thermometer One pound So we can so we can so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on My hypothesis is it s going to be 20 degrees My hypothesis is this is going to change it because it s only one pound Oh so what are you going to do to test that Weigh it Okay Put it here put it here Oh are you guys discussing What are you guys discussing Where we are going to put our balloons So first talk to me about your balloon Why did you choose this color Because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster We will think it will melt slower We think it will melt slower Why Because Because it s a light color The sun is attracted to the dark colors so that s why we picked pink So what are you doing right now Doing a hypothesis Oh can you explain what s your hypothesis Teagan It will be warm because we re going to put it next to the heater That s what I was going to say too And so what s your hypothesis How will that change the balloon Because maybe you said we re going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we ll put it in the heater and we think it ll melt faster Okay What about us It s almost in the middle take out one more Now I m going to count What were you guys just doing down there She was thinking about the weight What does that mean Like in the middle Okay so how will you figure out how much it weighs We need to take this out and we ll count them and then we ll write it on the paper 32 32 12 13 14 Brayden Brayden Hi Hayden Is there any group that s measuring the length of their s 28 29 30 31 32 Almost there 43 44 45 46 47 It s there it s there What does that mean So it means that they weigh the same thing Okay Now we have to count them Let s let Will only do it Two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 64 64 Teagan be working in your group 23 24 25 I measured my balloon by using tiles like tiles when I measured it Tiles What should we do now Mrs T My balloon is filled with matter Why do you say that Because everything is matter Well there s water inside the balloon so it s like solid and liquid Why is it solid and liquid What were you saying What were you saying No keep explaining your thinking I have a question One second Water is a liquid and pushes on the weight Oh so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis Light turns into water solids and liquids My hypothesis is my hypothesis is if we like if we If we lose the like point it will not melt faster Why It s a darker color And when you think about it dark colors will melt faster on their own Is that cubes the has the cubes No that s the weight Pass it on Have you all measured yours yet Yes How d you measure it With the tape thingy Would you mind showing me what you decide to do My hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we re putting it by the sun Did you make a hypothesis by the length of it No Ours was six and a half inches How do you know Because we measured it with the measuring tape Can you show me how you did it Oh there s an extra one Will Did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer Now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now These have bigger numbers you know So what are you thinking there Abigail I m thinking that not really But what were you saying there with the bigger numbers I didn t understand You held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers I mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell 30 30 30 he should start now So how big is your balloon We got to start at one Oh why did you change it Julia from your first measurement Because we accidentally started from the 30 Oh And now we have it upside down Okay you got it It was it is move your finger for me It is Now let s send this back here Okay I think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off Yeah Yeah I ll hold the thermometer I m trying to take it off My hypothesis is it s going to be warm but then not attracted to the light Cold water is in there Because sunlight can only make warmth Right
