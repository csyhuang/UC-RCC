so you can t count it out completely hmm so we have three things going on here i hear exponential decay i hear an upside down parabola and i hear a negative sloping line red why don t you chime in i haven t heard from you are you going with decay are you going with decreasing line you going with upside down parabola what had you guys decided we were going to go with decay but you were going to go with decay okay but i changed my mind because decay it keeps decreasing all the way but myspace it got to a point where it stopped decreasing and it was like what rosetta said so it stopped decreasing which is what you re saying and you re saying that s in agreement with rosetta i have a serious issue with a line stopping can somebody talk to me about that i have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself it s the end of the line slows itself colin i haven t heard from you i don t think it s linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on myspace i agree with elsie that it might be decay because it decreased but decay doesn t ever touch the x axis which would signify there are no users ah and there will always be users oooh what s somebody thing about that really really really significant comment that was just made by colin what do we think the fact that it s never going to how did you say it i said that the linear was going to at one point to hit zero and with decay it s never going to hit zero it s going to get really close but not touch it jeffrey i agree with colin because if it was a negative line like a negative line right you re going to go past zero and you can t have a negative amount of users cause a line keeps on going forever ok does exponential keep going forever no i mean yes yes it does but because it s so small that it never touches the x axis but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero so if we all agree are we getting closer to agreeing that it s exponential decay yes if we are agreeing it s exponential decay then what jeffrey just said what does that mean for myspace the company will it go out of business no based on what jeffrey just said about an exponential decay at the end what does that mean for myspace the company what do you know about myspace the company at this moment it s still low it s still low but is it in existence yes it is do you know what s keeping it you know i think because you re always going to have that one user account ok you might you might always have that one user there s something though that myspace provides that other websites don t that s very easy to do that other sites don t have and this is what s keeping it from touching that x axis do you know what it is alicia talk to us i can t hear you music yes alicia who is in the band would obviously know this right tell them what you do on myspace alicia bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them yeah you can upload your music on myspace easier than any of the other sites very good thank you for chiming in alright let s shift gears from myspace now let s talk twitter twitter twitter twitter what do you think about the growth of twitter alright keywords red start me off with keywords and then we ll bounce to pink and around the room give them your attention ladies and gentlemen are you guys prepared and ready for twitter rush i m sorry rush where show me it s missing something there what s your keyword rush it s in the middle of the sentence in the third sentence oh rush is that what you said ok just speak up i m getting old i can t hear growth continues steadily okay anything else yeah but it s at the tweets this the tweeted yeah it goes with this okay so what do you guys pick for the growth what function models twitter s growth exponential growth you think it s exponential growth as well alright is there a team pink you re up i disagree with that i think it s linear because it says that another keyword that they ve given is with 40 million in may that whole sentence right there got it that s like a slope if you think about it with 40 million in may 2009 6 months later 60 million and then 80 million in may 2010 the slope it would be 20 million so it s linear it s going positive slope hmm filling out those listening labs pink just gave some hard core evidence red do you have a comeback or have they won you over you have a comeback let s hear it lenny what s your comeback this can not be because because it s going to get to a point where it s going to stop it s not like we re going to take it like do you have a time machine ok so let s leave lenny i think exponential growth isn t going to stop and i think a line isn t going to stop right and i think that if we think about the future i think that s what star is maybe trying to do is predict the future we don t really know but from the language here in your text the information you do know i think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope do you agree yes yes anybody else want to chime in on this one that i haven t heard from maybe from elianna on blue bleaker i haven t heard from you carlia yet what do you guys think how bout anything you want to add about twitter anything you want to add greg go ahead well what lenny was saying i cannot beat and i agree with them that s it ok thank you any i agree with star because as you mentioned what this does or hope is that they ll be able to tweet via text messages and that s something that facebook didn t offer so the more things that the more things that twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase ok so as twitter grows you re saying the other networks might be slowed who though is going to outperform it if it s a different type of graph who is going to outperform twitter for sure if twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned facebook right because facebook is what exponential exponential very good ok so let s go now to aim we re doing very well on time here aim who s going to start us off with aim alright pink you can start us off keywords and reasoning talk to me some key words we worked was aol lost their dominance lost their dominance okay yep and then we put continuous fielding is growth today okay and we said that it was quadratic equations because at one point it was really high but then as time went by it started decreasing but then it started getting more popular again lately teenagers liked using it so it started going up again ok is there another keyword up here that would help anybody i think there s at least one more keyword that i haven t seen pointed up elianna is it comeback comeback where s comeback beautiful made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier jermaine thank you sorry say that again dominated dominated very nice jermaine so it started out dominating then had to make a comeback does anybody want to add on to what pink said about this being quadratic which way which way would make it positive from earlier positive what talk to me about the equation now quadratic is always going to do quadratics always go up no go down too parabolic this parabola they always look like this no think about inverses we learned through this year raise your hand and let me know what you want to say talk to me do parabolas always open upwards go ahead i just want to agree with them you agree that it s a parabola yeah because in a parabola it says that it started off dominating but you re on top if you re dominating then it said that it made a comeback that means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back they come back up beautiful wanna add to that go ahead i was just going to say the other end alright so i just want to make sure i answered purple s question in the back you asked which way take a look at this this is what you re talking about could the parabola be like this what would this mean if the parabola were down for the company if it was down then that means it s imaginary right you re thinking of something about imaginary and it s not if it s down that has to do with a negative right if there s a negative a coefficient something else though what would this mean for the company s trend deshawn go ahead deshawn they would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up and come back down purple are you alright with that now you understand this would not have worked based on what deshawn just said here s my question for you on aol why isn t aol an absolute value graph what starts high comes down and goes back up we did do absolute value functions right turn and talk first and then you re going to tell me write that question down somewhere i want to know why it s not an absolute value graph oh yeah we did talk about these today if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you re getting ten members then every five minutes you re gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible ok guys bring it back i want to know why isn t why didn t anybody say absolute value i m going to maybe put one over here and then i have one more really important question about these graphs for you and then we re in good shape absolute value the reason i asked that is because that also starts high comes down low and goes back up i need some reasoning let s change it around start with gold and go around go i don t think it s an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend because in the absolute value it s y is equal to absolute value of x meaning that as time passed they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people so like if you gained ten members every five minutes every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what every five minutes or when it goes down every five minutes you d be losing ten members whereas a parabola that changes is not constant you can lose and gain power then they d be equal to join or don t join and you can t guarantee that you re going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed so would it be fair to say it s too con,1.0
emotions is emotions that s so right kippa were you going to say something else in this picture he uses lots of texture to create like when he s doing the sunflowers he uses texture to show the light going on right and how did he show that texture did he how did he apply his paint sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick vincent would that you could almost feel it feel the texture and emotion like ozea said emotion was huge for vincent if he was happy he painted bright if he was sad he painted sort of dark how about our man pablo picasso what movement logan is he do you know the move cubism cubism and why do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism anybody besides mr logan anybody else know but thanks logan for raising what are you thinking what using geometric shapes to make things using geometric shapes that s right he was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see and flattening the shapes and flattening his color where van gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self portrait i wanna put up the work let s start with our man vincent again let s take a look at see where my hand oooh you can see all the wrinkles in my hand no way isn t that cool okay sorry don t mean to keep fooling around so let s talk about this let s talk about these two paintings guys what do you guys and let s see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something what do you see do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here anybody somebody besides kippa carina that it kinda has to deal with his emotion like where the boats are i feel like what i m feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff and then at the sunflowers he s really happy and bright and that was good carina okay elijah did you wanna was that about what you were gonna say you were gonna talk about the sadness what colors like do you think that if go ahead elijah he could ve been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark light red and all these other bright colors right and i remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer that s why i looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions wasn t that what you were saying yeah he was feeling both happy and sad cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too right that s good okay jose what did you wanna say he s sort of like there too but the boats might be out to sea like one s out to sea but one s not but torn i don t know how many are already but three are out in i don t know how many are out there s four that are here and then there look like four that are out i think that s the other okay but what were you going to say oh you re right three well what were you gonna say about them i m guessing three two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad but they could only take three because there s only enough for there s enough room for only three boats or three people but they only wanted their own boat two or three of them were but three didn t go because they didn t know what to do or anything but the other three did interesting that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw kind of yeah i like that i like that trevor what re you gonna say it s kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers they re mostly up but looks like they re starting to droop they re starting to die that is good i like that he might be like oh i m happy for a while but i m starting to feel back down nice did you wanna say something i would like to say one has different types of one looks more real those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the than the bottom more realistic than this picture he really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers i think does anybody know what were you gonna say elijah you can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there s bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it s orange and then at the very bottom it s dark green like right there yes that is very true that is very good the storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting wow kyle happiness is never lasting and what was the last one i m moved by that opinion go ahead and what was the so in the flowers the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die because happiness can be fleeting and we know oh does anybody know what was the political was there any political things going on the political mood or the setting where was vincent from did you guys find that in your research he stayed in france is that where he studied is that what you guys are telling me yeah that was sorta the hub of his movement we ll say any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that s up you can look on your research papers to see or anything go ahead emily i think that the actual emotions of these paintings don t really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in france so really i don t think they were much of a really affected him what were you going along with emily maybe he was just so dull that or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending so it depends maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then because he didn t have the happiest of all lives so he didn t we ve even talked about that do you guys remember when we talked about how vincent van gogh suffered a little bit mentally he was a little crazy crazy and in and out of mental institutions yeah so maybe something good happened cause his life was not very happy so most of his pictures are no not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull but you can tell when he s going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in like the boats you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad and then if you look at the sunflowers they re all bright and dreamy i mean yes this is a few dark bits but i think that s probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life guys this is really great i love all your comments logan i m gonna take one more and then i m gonna tell you something what go ahead logan i thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something and then he started painting it sad i have a question i think that you ve got something really important hon yeah so he never really stopped a painting in the middle when he started he finished he never stopped because if the light changed it would totally change the picture that s so true that is very true and you guys know that jose is it okay if i speak real quick and then we ll go back because we wanna talk about picasso too for a minute you guys know that vincent used to live with a painter this is my fun fact not really fun i guess but a fact about vincent he lived with a painter paul gauguin this was when he was in and out of mental institutions and they had a fight and he became so upset you guys know he cut off his ear and i showed you that one picture of him is a self portrait of him with his ear cut off you guys remember that and the other important thing i wanted to tell you was that he didn t sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after after he died they sold one of his paintings for 8 000 000 000 remember that it was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time okay now let s talk about and van gogh people if you guys wanna talk about picasso you can but let s give the picasso teams some time here this is and i m sorry the lighting is not the best but who knows what the name of this painting is marie is it three musicians three musicians and it was done by who pablo pablo picasso does anybody know where pablo picasso was from let s see someone other than mr logan travis barcelona barcelona where s barcelona you guys spain spain i got my barcelona jersey alright and who knows rudy do you happen to know and he s like uh oh i m on the spot ooo do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in pablo picasso in cubism cubism that s correct and we did go over what were the characteristics of cubism real fast anybody mr logan geometric shapes geometric shapes and what else they were flat what was flat his pictures but what element his painting the colors the colors were flat thank you okay let s have some opinion about what you see up here the three musicians does anybody have randy do you have any how do you feel about it honey what do you think about it i don t know it doesn t seem like it s in a down mood cause music is usually a happy sort of thing so it seems like a happy kinda picture kind of a happy fun picture pablo he wasn t so concerned about emotions when he painted he maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time does anybody know what was happening in spain at the time what are you thinking civil war there was a civil war so maybe he was a little bit affected by that he also traveled does anybody know where he traveled to rudy to go and study the art forms of paris he went to paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff so he went to study there and then where else he went to africa he went to africa and he really became obsessed with african masks and so he did start using that as an influence in his painting carina what were you gonna say darling oh i was thinking it s kind of like a mix of emotions cause it has so many colors there s bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper there s a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention it s attention grabbing isn t it cause of all the contrasting i think more in his is the contrasting colors you can see the blue and orange right next to each other those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright they totally stand off each other right the blue and the orange i can t remember what oh they re complementary colors i couldn t remember what that was right so that s why and i think his color contrast says a lot his flat colors and they re bright and he puts them right next to each other what do you think about this picture robert do you like it yeah do you know why you might like it or you don t like it i like the picture like yeah well you and maria are talking about doing remember you were talking about making your own picture you wanna tell us about that what you guys wanna do for your own picture and you re doing the style of pablo aren t you yeah so what do you think you guys are gonna do have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the three musicians on a porch you wanna have the three musicians be in a picture with you and your brother and maria are you gonna not on a porch on a deck that s what i was gonna say and you guys are gonna are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes the picture yeah try to good good do you guys have anybody oh what were you gonna say elijah it makes me think about it because there s so many twists and turns and curves and things kinda like if you look hard enough you can see em but when you just look at it you re like whoa right when you first look at it you re like whoa what is that are those people are those shapes there s lots of curves and turns at first it s a little confusing at first it is a little confusing isn t it when you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for em you can actually see what it is right if we didn t tell you it was the three musicians you might not know at first you can kinda tell because of that one right there that thing yeah the instrument here and the guitar and then the paper with the two the sheet music the sheet music you could kinda tell it was about the musicians what were you gonna say when you first look at the painting your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue s clarinet whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying at first when you just but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form it does start to form what were you gonna say emily i think that in

no i want you to swing the eighth notes okay we re going to swing the eighth notes so remember when you swing you just make the first note longer than the second note so go like this don t be stuck at the tip of your bells here we go one a two a three and go every single person here please make sure you re playing f natural try it again here we go one two and go okay now when you guys improvise you ve got to improvise off of this d dorian scale okay so watch this if i was soloing and i was you know playing along with the music and i played this all i did was play the d dorian scale going up and down that s all it was it sounded a little fancy didn t it it really wasn t did it sound difficult yes it really wasn t i just did this like really changing the rhythm that s basically all i did okay so it s really not that difficult i m gonna play some rhythms i want you guys to echo it please sit up thank you nice and tall i m gonna play one measure and you re going to repeat exactly what i play we re playing this one on open d only on open d great now i m going to do two measures okay two measures and you ve got to echo it back to me this is still open d here we go wait for it i ll tell you when to go excellent okay it goes like this i m going to change it and go there it is okay it s just four notes in the second measure so try it again and go do this for me and go try this i m playing d and f so the higher pitch that you hear is f natural so play this for me great fantastic i m only going to add one more note you want to play d f and g okay with the exception of basses so do an open g okay so d f and g are your three notes all right get in playing position okay so basically that s improvising i m giving you a lot of ideas for improvising okay and you will only use three notes when you improvise d f and g you don t have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes when you improvise there are certain rules to improvising you can t just play any note because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice okay so we don t want to play the wrong note so please make sure that you only play d f and g do you see that tune that s on whatever page that s on for you guys there should be a page that s got solos at the top and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune you ll pick the third one with the tune do you guys see it yeah okay make sure you re on the correct side i ll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds and then i m going to have you guys play it okay listen to my tempo are you guys following along okay play it for me here we go watch your rests one two and go much better now good now play it again one two and go good i want you to play it one more time i m going to play the piano with you though all right here we go great now i m going to solo for you guys and i want to show you how you can do this okay a couple things that i did in there all i did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note that s all i did it sounds really difficult didn t it yeah it was like whoa no i m just going i can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult you can do it too okay so we re going to go around the room each person is going to solo okay whatever musical idea you come up with remember your notes are d f and g you got it d f and g whatever rhythm you want to play within the rhythms i gave you so don t okay here we go here s how we re going to do it we re going to start with maybe two measures we re going to start with tessa and go around maybe after helen then we go with tallulah priscilla listen carefully after tallulah we re going to go around this way after jada we re going to start with sammy and we re going to end with zoey okay we re all going to start with two,1.0
it s big okay and that s all and the little blood cells and i drew one on there in kinda like a magnified and there s little blood strands they re blood strands dna strands now those dna strands are only in the blood are they anywhere else in your body they re in your hair and in your fingernails in your skin they re everywhere okay so it s not just in the blood but you usually get it from the blood blood okay alright it looks like you ve got a couple questions you can call on whoever you want me are these questions you guys are these questions for ryan okay how do you know chuck was right what well he s a pretty smart guy who chuck my uncle oh okay maybe even though there s a bunch of dna on the strand what does that have to how do you know that a piece of that dna came from either the mom or the dad that s why because dna comes from both of them the dad gives the dna and the mom provides the dna okay david it was in the blood right you said it was in the blood right yeah yes but couldn t blood be transmitted to another person because they had the yeah it could be transmitted to another person so that s not really a trait sure when someone gets a blood transfusion yeah right like if you re in the hospital and you re injured and you get blood transfusions if your eyes are blue and you get a blood transfusion from a brown eyed person does that turn your eyes brown no it could if okay does it give you a widow s peak when you have a straight hairline no okay if i get a blood transfusion tomorrow hopefully that doesn t happen but if i get a blood transfusion tomorrow is that going to give me a cleft chin no if the person had a cleft chin but how do people die when they get when they get blood transfusions carlos can we talk about that later maybe let s stick with how we get our traits do we get it through the blood okay not really girls what do you think over there i was sure it had something to do with the blood but that s between your parents and it has nothing to do with the traits so i don t know do you want to come over here too i want to come over there with the boys yes i you guys are you guys haven t even said anything yet and already they re they re joining your group okay should we hear from the people who think i ve got a large lorenzo do you want should we hear from you or are you thinking about coming over to this group too you re set okay let s hear from lorenzo okay lorenzo what do you think i think that it was that brown eyed people have more traits than blue eyed people because i know more people that are brown eyed than blue eyed and i think i read somewhere that usually brown eye is a dominant trait over the blue eyes so for most of the times brown eyed people if you have brown eyed parents you will get brown eyes but how is so you heard something about a dominant trait okay any questions about that dominant trait brown eyes being dominant trait because a lot of people have brown eyes like that and not many people have blue eyes true blue eyes are more rare okay lorenzo whoever you want to call on you ve got two people so like what you were saying right now something about your parents then you would get it from your parents hmm what because when he was when he was saying that about the traits he said you if your parents have brown eyes or blue eyes that you re gonna get that trait from them so from your parents so interesting do you get what she s saying what she s she s saying she s sticking with this group because it s coming from your parents okay that s why they say it s half and half okay also i m in your group too but what s it called yeah i see more brown eyes but still they always get their traits from the parents not only but a lot of people have some people still get blue eyes and then others it s because of they still get the traits from the parents and some of them don t look alike so what about what about some people have both of the parents have brown eyes and some of the kids turn they have their blue eyes though yeah that s great because that s a great how many of you guys have seen something like that i have seen it where two parents have one trait and then their kid has the opposite trait like brown eyed parents blue eyed kid you guys have seen that why does that happen what do you think i m not really sure i know my parents have brown eyes and me and you have green eyes yeah your parents both have brown eyes right and your eyes are blue yeah okay so why does that happen lorenzo since it was your idea let s hear from you if i m correct there s more brown eyed traits so you get if you have a brown eyed parent and a blue eyed parent you get a brown eyed trait and a blue eyed trait but because brown eyed is dominant most of the time you get brown eyed but you still have blue eyed traits so even if you have two parents with brown eyed trait if they both also have the blue eyed trait you could get blue eyes i have a question for you lorenzo you keep using this word dominant trait does in your mind does dominant mean more more when you re saying more traits in your mind does dominant mean there s more of it yeah okay what do you guys how many of you guys have heard this word dominant there s recessive too which is recessive okay does dominant mean more anyone know that it means power over the others like an overpowering trait he s trying to say are you trying to say more are you trying to say more or are you trying to say stronger stronger okay so this group the group you re sitting in the group one right now is someone who thinks that there s more traits come from the brown do you think that you re not sure say yes but you know something about dominant okay i ll stay with my group yes can i make my own group where it s like yeah good yes what are you thinking i m moving maybe it s just maybe that nature decides what something will look like because i don t know my parents have brown eyes and i have blue eyes and we don t really have anyone else who has blue eyes you re picking the wait a minute fiona no olivia yeah nature okay nature makes so you ve got blue eyes nature had something to do with that not your parents yeah okay anyone want to respond to that ryan how does nature do that how does nature choose your eye color doesn t it have something to do with your parents of course how could you just a slot machine where it s like ching and then the eye colors roll around and stuff oh you got blue eyes i don t know let him respond you re not sure no i m not sure i m still any other questions oh yeah and like you know how i was gonna ask this what if you get it from your grandparents or your grandparents have black eyes or from your aunts or something i really don t know if your aunts and sisters yeah what if his aunt and sister has blue eyes that s right what if somewhere way back someone in your family had blue eyes you guys better i don t see how that how does that happen does anyone know people who look like their grandparents yeah my cousin does lorenzo my mom said that i look like my grandparent because i have a mole or something that s in the same spot as my grandpa if that s the case for you does that support what he s saying nature decides or does that keep you in what you re thinking it keeps me in but i have a question okay how do people one eye is blue and the other one is green oh i know that one that s a mutation no no some people have really yeah like all right let s refocus let s refocus we haven t heard from this group we haven t heard from the few groups that have the most amount of people in them okay so let s give them a chance to talk ladies can you start us off you guys read it i have to read it we agree that people get half their traits from their parents we think this is a trait from both of their parents also for example that what for example if one person has one parent has because for example for me i have my dad s eyes and i have my mom s my mom s she has traits from some from your mom and some from your dad okay yeah it looks like you ve got someone who wants to say something about that but if what if you get more if you get some traits from your ancestors too and not just your parents what about your that would just go back a generation though does that still support what you re thinking yeah no because we re talking about the parents how they have half yeah but you then also get from your parents some of them so some people don t look like their parents at all but they look like someone else in their family i m seeing this issue come up again what about grandparents kids who look like their grandparents how does that happen does anyone here wanna any of you guys go ahead you still get it from your parents because your parents if your grandma has it then that trait is somewhere in your mom or your dad it just doesn t show up as much so it can transfer back to you what can we call that that there s a trait in you and you just don t see it does anyone know a word for that invisible i heard it over here recessive yes recessive okay who else has heard recessive raise your hands scientists call a recessive gene a gene that does not express itself it doesn t mean it s a little gene that s quiet it just means that it s a gene that s not showing or a trait sorry a trait that s not showing that s called recessive you also want to talk about this more a little bit more let s stay on this topic i think it will help us figure it out yes ryan like he was saying it s probably about the dna strands when they when two people combine in different parts or put in different pieces of it like maybe one like maybe the blue eyes is out and brown eyes goes in there or maybe when they have one of those recessive genes the recessive genes get it goes into the strand too maybe when tyler said that none of neither of his parents have blue eyes maybe his grandpa or his grandma or their grandparents maybe one of them had blue eyes and it was in his mom or his dad and it went into the strand that he was created from it didn t show up in the mom but then it popped up in the kid yeah okay david i don t know i think i don t know if i agree with him but i think i kind of do because like he said it was dominant but he still has he still has a little bit in him so it s kind of like a well because you still have some of your traits or your parents still kind of have a little bit how are okay how are how is this idea that brown eyed kids have i m sorry brown eyed there s more traits in brown eyes right is that what this idea is about all you guys right here how is that like this one that we get half from mom and half from dad or how can we use some of this thinking and layer it onto some of this thinking so they re both right the question is how are those two the same right how are that one and this one the same how are pieces from this how do we use pieces from this idea that lorenzo is bringing up dominant and recessive how do we use pieces from this and combine it with pieces from this group over here let me get you to talk about that with your group let me ask i ll ask that question one more time what s right about what these guys are saying and how can we add it to stuff this group is thinking what if the kid is born blind right or what if the kid comes out deaf and blind some express themselves and some don t woo that you just gave me a brain scan because you read my mind say there s two dna strands one in this hand one in this hand they combine the dominant ones from each of these take over and make one of all the dominant ones that were in them can you give me an example with tyler maybe there was a dominant gene the blue eyes was dominant maybe it was passive before it started whatever it s called recessive and then it became dominant but over time and then it went in tyler how can a dominant gene become a recessive gene and become dominant again maybe every time it gets passed down hmm like with us we get bigger what if your if your mom had two blue eyed parents but ryan here today and they combine i found it all right are we ready to pull back all right i didn t get to hear from all these two groups but i did get to hear from them i think what this group has is something good and i think you guys want to hear it you re gonna be the spokesperson for that group great we agree that people get mom and 50 from their dad we think this because if there s two people who made the baby then it s logically should be split in half but all every time someone has a baby all of their genes of both parents go into the baby only some of them decide to express themselves and show go ahead say i have two dna strands from two different people say mary and joe mary and joe both had grandparents that both have blue eyes and that gene got passed down to them now they combined to make one gene say mary had blue eyes had a blue eyed gene and joe had a blue eyed gene those two genes combined to make one dominant blue eyed gene and it goes in like what tyler like with tyler right so we tyler he used you as an example your parents both have brown eyes right mm hmm and what were you guys saying about his parents both have brown eyes but something they had something else too yeah because everyone kind of has a little bit of everything in them it s just some some color or some trait just decides to show because it s more dominant you know the movie you know the movie that movie they went to some place and they went to go get found out they got the book from some person and they matched it up to ours and it was different colors so they had different kind of genes for like for things so if you compare a baby who has blue eyes and one who has brown eyes it s gonna have it s gonna have different things with the eyes the dna thing will be different maybe those dna genes that in a dna maybe they would look different for a blue eyed person than a brown eyed person yeah did you wanna say something maybe the dna of tyler s parents for example if their grandparents had blue eyed dna accumulating in them it might have been passed down through them and then when they got to where they were forming tyler inside their his mom s stomach it might have the blue dna might have overpowered combining those two blue dnas by getting it might have overpowered the brown eyes which made tyler get the blue eyes 50 it could be like 50 that happened in my family they re saying what color eyes are your parent s tyler what s your mom s eye color brown oh yeah what you got on your mom s side from my brown eyed mom brown so what about your mom s mom what about your dad s what about your dad all right you guys let s talk let s talk for a second if we ve got an example of one person in science you never hang everything on one person let s be careful about that and we don t want to have him be the reason for all but this is a good example do we think that people can have genes in them that aren t showing but then they can have a kid and then those genes pop up yeah because if the two genes did you want to say something about it lorenzo yeah because i think that if a parent had brown eyes and one had blue eyes but the brown eyed parent also had some blue eyed genes then the baby would probably come out blue because it has the blue eyed gene and then half of the blue eyed gene from the other parent how could we figure out how we get our traits for sure because we have a lot of ideas but what in science class what will we do what kind of activity could we do what kind of research could we do how would we find out we could go on askjeeves com and we so we could look it up on the internet okay guys one resource we could look at how else could we figure this out we could take a survey didn t we do that the class we did no but we could whole school so we have more to research or more i don t know make a larger sample size then we get information and we find out that x percent of our students have brown eyes and x percent of our students have blue eyes how does that help us find out where those traits came from it gives us more of an idea their parents and their grandparents too and their great grandparents we d have to ask people to we d have to ask people to do some research on their families okay so we could do some family research sonja we could make up an assignment sure okay,1.0
it s similar to when we had the hand warmer what happens is when you add heat energy to the hand warmer it makes the water rise up so in the glass in the two liter bottle in the glass too the heat lamp added heat to it the heat energy then the water started to rise up of the water okay so why do you think the water spilled over last time i think that it s because of the molecules expanding okay and then the molecules didn t have enough room well the water didn t have enough room so it had to get out so then it popped out through the tube okay do you share the same idea yeah do you agree with her yes okay alright let s talk about this yes i have something like with mine we thought that since there was oxygen i mean there was a glass tube that the water had room to expand and like spill out so what s why it did okay thank you alright let me ask you something how many of you put that water molecules expanded raise your hand as a reason for water spilling alright okay they gave you the reason why right so who can tell me why you put that alright rebecca i put that because well you see it well in the bottle lab we had water in there so when it heated up they expanded and they didn t have enough room so they had to it had to come out so molecules got bigger right yeah if you don t believe molecules got bigger what did you guys think that the water spilled over yeah i think if the water molecules didn t get bigger i think that the heat caused them to move around and bump into each other okay so what is the evidence for both of these you played with the water heater where is the evidence to support this anybody anthony like what i think is that that the steam is like mostly involved with this cause the only type of air water has is steam and like since the water was heated so intensely it had to let out all the air it contained so it spewed out steam okay thank you very much good job i m gonna go over with moorea why do you think that water you didn t agree with water molecule being expanding right yeah so what is your evidence that it is not expanding well i think when we added the heat to the water i think the molecules started getting hotter and the heat was transferred from the lamp to the molecules and they started moving around more kind of like how sugar makes people like have a sugar rush and kind of move around more and get more excited and then they just needed more room so they spilled out into the tube okay now let me ask you something if that is true how come if i press it here it s going down why yes tyshon because of the heat in your hand what s happening the heat of my hand right saron so it goes down faster because the heat in your hand is enclosing around the top i guess so it will make it come down jake i m not sure but i think it goes down faster yes because of everybody else saying that when you hold from the heat of your hand but i think it s also because gravity pushes things down okay alright alec has two finger means he has something to add i agree with jake and i also think that since the water went down it s because it had more room at the bottom so when you put your hand around it it immediately goes down also because of gravity and how it has more room how did you come up with that answer well when you were holding the top i saw that the bottom was empty and like so i thought that cause of gravity when you hold it at the top it has more room to go down but if you hold the bottom look at the whole bottom hold the bottom what s happening it s right there it s against the gravity it s going up so hold on i m gonna provide the evidence about the result this is computer simulation watch this carefully i want you to watch this carefully and look at this the right side is water okay the right side is water and did i turn the heat on yeah yeah okay so who turned it off i m gonna reset it okay and then heat is off watch look at air and water molecule let s look at the water molecules first since we re doing the liquid part are you with me yeah alright what is happening to water molecule write it down with your group you ve got 30 seconds talk to the group molecules are vibrating very slightly since the water s mostly cooled down more than the air it s more stable it s like doesn t vibrate as much as air cause water is like more still and more like a solid than air okay please observe everything and i m going to be asking you questions alright and here we go i m gonna turn the heat on as a group you need do discuss and write everything down what you see here just the air i mean i m sorry just observe the water yes everything okay here we go group water only okay now discuss with your group alright water only the water molecules they aren t moving around like the air ones but they re vibrating they re moving like back and forth they re vibrating like really violently they re staying in the same general area like but the water ones are like i m sorry the molecules in the air are bouncing around and when the heat is applied they start bouncing around faster i agree with maor but i think that with the air ones that they have more room to bounce around that the water is all contained in one thing so the molecules have to stay in one position but the air has to what do you think ladies you haven t said anything i think the same thing as maor because the air molecules have more room to the surrounding because it s really nothing in there and since water is a liquid it has less room whatever i see that the more the heat gets on the water alright 30 more seconds so we re gonna start the discussion there are people who need more time to write but you already know what to do so here we are okay i m gonna call on individuals so please do so you don t have to stand up ivree i saw that when you turned on the lamp it started vibrating faster than which one we re talking about which one the water okay vibrating faster joon po you think through the temperature also started rising very little excellent dylan what else did you notice i m noticing that when the heat is on the water is starting to vibrate very fast when it s turned on but they are staying stationary they re not actually moving anymore so why do you think the water molecules are vibrating chelsea because of the heat that is going on to the molecules so what you re saying is the heat source is going to molecules class what do you call the heat source which is the lamp what is it heat energy heat energy very good so in this case i don t know if you agree with chelsea raise your hand how many of you disagree raise your hand alright how many of you agree with chelsea raise your hand okay alright the molecules are transferring energy the heat energy is transferring heat to the energy thank you very much now next part i m going to give you a life problem to solve and i want you to come up with solutions okay how many like to play ping pong oh excellent you know i grew up playing ping pong because in asian culture ping pong s a lot cheaper to purchase than basketballs so most every home has ping pong or ping pong table because it s easy to make out of wood now having said that suppose you received a set of ping pong balls for holiday because you asked for it from your parents and your parents being really nice and you behaved really well they decide to give you these ping pong balls you got the problem is you lost all of them except one and your best friend came over to play with this but he stepped on it on accident so now here s a dent right he has to fix it can you fix it you re all worried because you ve never seen anybody can fix this so give me some suggestions by talking to your group alright you have buddies back up there alright kind of like the water bottle right especially like you can fix another part maybe you could do the same thing with the ping pong ball like if you start to squish the ping pong balls down and maybe you could its place it d be easier to pop it out i think you can apply air you can apply air like with heat like at least heat cause you know when the heat was added to the water right like you could apply air with a little do you need more time like the thing okay so i m going to write the solution alright by asking group that has an answer just stand up one at a time the group that hasn t answered yet alright so here s a solution say ping pong ball dilemma alright okay number one which group is gonna be just stand up just stand up if you haven t spoke in this group we already thought that you could try and use your hands and like pop the air back into it and get it to its original shape okay alright number two something different which group that hasn t spoken yet okay chelsea s group alec said that if you push around the edges it might pop back into shape so kind of the same thing yes we think that somehow if you maybe poked a hole in it you can use like an air pump or some sort of machine to get the air in it and maybe the air will push against the dent and make it a sphere again let s see how many of you believe this dilemma raise your hand okay alright how many of you believe this is gonna work raise your hand how many believe this is gonna work alright is there a third option anybody okay yes i don t know if this will work but maybe you can put in front of a lamp okay excellent start but why would you put it in front a lamp let me ask you something maybe so that the molecules in it like in the water example maybe they ll start like vibrate no you re okay well it s air so you want to add heat energy right yeah you want to add heat alright so we re gonna try all of those so let s try with number one so i m going to give sasha a ping pong ball that s been dented by my best friend or not my best friend her best friend so she s gonna try to do it okay number two is what pop a hole in it so how many of you disagree with this or of this idea why would you disagree with this idea dylan because if you poked a hole in it it would be kind of like ruin it and release all this stuff and it would be kind of hard to okay what are you ruining in this case the ping pong ball in other words what you re saying is a surface of the thing yeah okay did you try yeah like it s really hard so it s actually hard to pop it back in let s see who s strong me okay you re strong she wants to do it if she doesn t work then let s do it okay how about the lamp lamp thingy so let s see are you the one that says the come on over okay leave it like this turn the heater on okay on the top yeah that s it the other way there you go right there yeah there you got it oh okay oh what happened it helps if it s connected isn t it okay try that again there so we re gonna time it while we re working on this for a couple minutes okay alright okay alright so who has the ping pong now the dent was too strong okay now look at the ping pong ball i m gonna show it to you okay look you saw it right all of you what happened it has more dents not only the dent what else it broke is this gonna work that s completely ruined what did that do nothing alright so let s say first idea is no good okay so second idea poke a hole we agreed that it s not gonna work because it s gonna compromise how many of you agree with that it s gonna compromise the shape of the thing okay alright the third idea alright it s about a minute nothing s happening okay do you have any other suggestions who hasn t said anything sydney i think maybe you could like put it between your hands because it might work the same as the lamp but just faster okay so how many agree that looks like both of you if i m not mistaken that you have to have some kind of heat right you said because i said because like the water it needs room to expand well it s not actually expanding but it needs room to move so the ball will probably expand okay i m gonna show you this simulation is there something yes dylan yeah i want to add maybe it would work better under a stronger heat source okay like a sun yeah like okay can i tell you something that i did before the class i put it under the lighter and the ping pong went like pshhh you know to be honest with you the ash was big as this one that was it i was looking for ping pong ball it ll burn alright now i want to show you this simulation again okay so bear with me here you all said the two things i m gonna talk about you all said the molecules were expanding meaning molecules are getting bigger right tell me is this molecule getting bigger no okay so molecules are not getting bigger how many of you believe it s not getting bigger remember simulation is evidence is that what is happening like many of you said already jake they re moving around really fast in the space for air and water they re vibrating so look at the air this time alright the air so class which one would you say is moving faster air okay so air is moving faster okay we re gonna discuss this next step so everyone s gonna get a big picture you have a question i need to see the finger thing yes i have a i guess reason well i have another thing that i noticed about that i guess you could say i think that the reason why the water molecules are moving slower is because the water is taking up space and they can t travel around that fast because in the air there s really nothing in there that s stopping them from moving but i guess you can compare it to us when we re swimming under water we move slower than we normally do on land yeah so air molecules are moving really fast right so what s happening as it s moving very fast sydney you have something to add okay i was just gonna say if you look at water it sort of looks like it s in an invisible cage and it s trying to move around but it can t so it s restricted it doesn t move as well,1.0
what i m going to do is we are going to use these projects to help students at our school mrs ess s class is not the only class that has had problems with students accidentally plagiarizing and that was the original reason that you guys came here today because somebody in another class had plagiarized something accidentally in mrs ess s class your projects today are going to be used in other classrooms so we re going to have a contest we re going to pick the 5 best powerpoints and we re going to send them out to other classrooms to help students learn why they shouldn t plagiarize now some of you are already experts at powerpoint we re not learning how to do powerpoint right now a lot of you already know how to summarize because you learned to summarize in mrs ess s class so you have that experience there was a disconnect where you didn t put the two together so what we re doing right now is we re saying okay i know how to summarize now i know how to avoid plagiarism so let s start working right now you have your rubric look at your rubric if you have a question raise your hand and i ll come and explain it and we re going to start right this very second so go ahead and get into powerpoint and do your powerpoint if you re going to be doing something different like making a newspaper a brochure or maybe a podcast then you re going to start working on that and i am just going to walk around you guys our focus is plagiarism and the way we avoid plagiarism is through focusing on summarizing so you can refer back to your notes remember you used your cornell notes the other day when you were here and we went online and you took a summarization quiz and tutoring session i ll be right there in a second yes i m sorry okay david yes yes absolutely i m sorry i ll be back to you in a moment yes i think that would be a great idea we re focusing on plagiarism and we ve learned about how summarization is one of the ways to avoid it right okay i m sorry sure very good oh great you re back up okay tissues are behind the globe can you go get one for me okay have you been helped you have to know how to spell it right over there on the board how s it going cathy pretty much take off the s i like that though it was good you need some help mr phillip no thank you you re fine what you re doing is looking through here at all the requirements so when you use your creativity to put this together and i yes what does this word mean okay so multimedia basically means that it could be either powerpoint or a podcast so you need all of these to get the highest grade so if you come up with something additional you re going to get a higher grade this part you did here is basically your method of memorization which would be number 3 how is it going pretty good now remember if you re taking a definition of plagiarism from a website then you really need to say where you got that there s a way of doing that you re going to state where you got that and when it was yes that s okay you re going to use your own words it s interesting how different all of these look yes you can you definitely can i also have some books available they re hiding you could eric use this book too i ve got you marked right here would anyone else like a dictionary you can get an online definition too okay i ve got them marked you can find it easily that way can we use our paper to take notes yes of course you can if that would help you cathy have you gotten to powerpoint yet no do you know how to do that oh good okay david i m sorry i ve got it in this book too is that your second slide or your first slide my first okay okay like i said before the purpose of doing this is to try to help other students in our school and a lot of you already know ways of avoiding plagiarism maybe you were even aware that you were plagiarizing and we ve been focusing on summarizing of course there s another way you can do it paraphrasing is a little bit harder but we re focusing on summarizing and besides summarizing another thing that you can do with summarizing is still giving credit to where it came from yes hang on okay what was this animoto video telling us can someone raise their hand and yes brandy telling you not to plagiarize telling you not to plagiarize very good so if that s what you were thinking you are thinking about what we re going to talk about today which is plagiarism now i m going to go on the internet right now and we re going to look at the definition of plagiarism well actually we re going to look at the definition for plagiarize which is to steal and pass off as your own so you can think of internet plagiarism as equal to cheating cheating and that is considered academic misconduct academic misconduct and that s when you get in big trouble sometimes now we re going to watch a teachertube video about plagiarism so you will be using your worksheet and we re going to hear a story about this kid named billy and you ve got some bubbles here so right here in the central box is what you re going to write down you re going to write in this box and you can t write anything yet because nothing s happened so far but you re going to write about what billy did and in the little circles right here you re going to write the causes why it probably happened and you re going to predict what happens to billy so we re going to start right now so i want everybody to listen carefully here we go mrs calstad hey mr harris i have to show you this research report by billy he did it on horses it sounds really good the pictures are good too oh i love horses let me see it wow mr harris this is really good i told you it was but you know what it kind of sounds familiar i ve seen a lot of students looking at this website called allhorses info and i think it s some of this exact same information i think we should check it out let s pull it up sure here s the website mr harris and it says right here the horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries what does billy s report say the horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries so it s the exact same sentence that s not good that s not good that s cheating and look at that picture too it s the exact same photo that is the exact same photo did billy give credit to his sources anywhere on that page no i don t see it anywhere no well that s a pretty serious thing i ve heard of students in college being expelled for that really yes i think they call it plagiarism when you copy someone else s work and don t give them credit and that s a shame because all billy had to do was write down where he got his facts and give some credit to that photo too how could he have written his report differently well if you look at his first sentence when it says the horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries he just could ve changed the words a little bit maybe he could have explained what domesticated means i don t think that s a word that he would use a lot i see what you mean what could he have done with this picture though well he could use this picture if he took the picture himself he wouldn t have to do anything but if he did take it from this website which it looks like he did he d just need to copy the web address down at the top and that would be it that way he could give the photographer credit for that person s work so what you re saying is it s okay to use facts from other sources just put them in your own words correct and be sure to include in your report who wrote these facts exactly and as far as the photos go you can use a photo as long as you include the web address that s on your screen and i think in library and psychology class you and i will work on that with students so everyone will know how they can properly give credit to their sources we definitely will that sounds good now we just need to talk to billy about this sounds like a plan where is that billy okay you have your work sheets let s start filling them out right now make sure your name s on your paper and we won t take too long we ve got some extra time as well so when you start writing if you have a question raise your hand you re going to do the predicted cause and the predicted effects now while you re filling these out i m also going to ask a question i want to do a quick question what do you think happened to billy can somebody raise their hand and tell me what do you think might happen to billy he got in trouble with the teacher he probably got in trouble with the teacher anybody else detention and possibly detention yes suspension say it one more time a suspension very good okay now let s do a quick think pair share okay what is the message of this video so talk to you neighbor let s think in a pair talk to your neighbor the person sitting right next to you cassie you work with brandy brandy you work with santiago talk to your neighbor real quick your question is what is the message of this video okay we re going to stop right now raise your hand if you can share if you can share out right now yes he could use facts and research very good so if he used facts and research information in his own words this wouldn t have happened yes he has to give credit to the original site or the place he got it very good thank you cassie that was great okay so now we ve done our video and i just wanted to say that as a sixth grader i made a big mistake before they had the internet i used an encyclopedia set and i copied stuff into my report and i thought here s the information i didn t realize i was actually plagiarizing it because i didn t put it in my own words so now what we re going to do is we re going to move over to our renaissance responders so right now you re all logged in and i am going to go over to that right now and we have a survey so it s all re programmed and we re ready to go and what we re going to do is we re going to flip our paper to the back side and you ve got your questions right here we re doing an anonymous survey to find out how you feel about plagiarism so i don t want you to feel that it s going to be something that i m going to know your response to because it really is going to be anonymous and i want you to circle the answer that is the most popular response to the group so when you look up here you re going to see a graph and you re going to circle the answer that is the most popular and you re going to star the answer that is the second most popular okay what is the level of plagiarism at our school you have three choices students do not plagiarize very often that s letter a b about half of the students plagiarize c almost everyone plagiarizes go ahead and respond now we re going to look at the graph and we re waiting for everybody to respond right now and i m looking and i can see some people have responded and some people have not responded on your paper you will be circling the most popular response and you re starring the second most popular response can somebody tell me what the most popular response is right now a a okay and that was students don t plagiarize very often that s good to know so go ahead and mark on your paper right now a has a circle around it for number one and our second most popular response actually is c and e so both of those will get starred i m so sorry did i say e i meant c i think that what happened is somebody made a response in a column that they shouldn t have made a response in that column so they answered the wrong question so you did it the proper way we re going to move on to our question number two,1.0
what do you think it is going to be this time i think it s going to be like negative 57 59 maybe like 54 or something colder or hotter you don t need to touch you don t need to touch it you and your temperature i got a playing with your go down the temperature is going to go down with the ice it was 22 22 no not 22 you think ice the temperature is going to go down the water went up it s your choice how much of anything you put in should we put a lot a little more a little more why don t you dump it into not the whole thing yeah oh don t put it all in like that there s hardly any room ready go science is kind of messy isn t it it s okay just put it back in there and work together tell me when to go ready ready and start what do you think i think it s going to be like maybe 20 degrees or maybe negative 10 we ll just have to see 40 jacob 40 no it s 50 40 50 degrees it s almost it s 50 degrees jake it s 50 degrees it s 50 degrees jake what s he doing so where s the line try to put one in oh so now you get it where s the line and it s 40 40 comes out like 44 what s the temperature it changed 44 it says 40 no it s 44 jacob it doesn t matter what are you having a dispute about here get out now it was right here so it s on it s not even gone down and now it went up to what well a little higher than that yours went up so what did how do you know jacob by looking at the thermometer how it went up or down explain to me i know how it went up because i see because if you turn your head away and then you look at it it went up you think so how do you read this though are they there s five lines right let s see but how do you break it up so you can read it to get from 70 to 80 how do you break that up jacob do you know um right you count by twos okay you guys get busy i m interrupting your experimental time you re scientists here down all the way down just color it up to 50 down 30 i wonder what was in it i think it s salt i don t think it s salt last time i used last time i used it it went down and then it went down even more that s what i told you it s floating i m breathing in good water water what happened use the thermometer ready set go one more i think it s going to get colder and i think it s going to get i think it s going to get negative 10 what do you think emily zero degrees maybe negative zero i m not sure there is a negative zero it s like frost all over it cold frost right here whatever was in it makes it go down temperature go down makes frost mystery is salt the mystery grain is salt the mystery grain is salt it s melting the ice and it s condensing on the outside ready guys five four what do you guys think it is what do you think the temperature s going to be this time i don t know lower than 50 555 degrees that would be toasty got to be lower one two three four five i see that most of you have finished your experiment i would like to call and see i m going to get some questions take it out okay eight i have questions teagan your group needs to come to me please thank you very good jacob what did you notice between the base temperature and the first time when you put the water in what happened i noticed that when the base temperature when we put in the base temperature it was only water it only changed by one degree it only changed by one degree very good number nine who s number nine kayla kayla what did you guys notice about the temperature we what happened to it what happened to the temperature it went down it went down what happened to your can who knows think about that take a minute with your group i want you to talk about what s happening to your can and why so maybe it got frost for they get more frost on it when i put and it got yellow the water was clear and then it got yellow when we put salt in it got dirty it looks like lemonade it s all mushy the stuff is looking to the ice that and making it squishy okay one two three four five come back to me for a minute i pulled number five number five what is happening to your can it s getting frost on it it s getting frost on it why do you think it s getting frost what did your group think that it was getting frost on it from the ice and the mystery ingredient the mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty what did we learn about with the weather cycle we talked about that what s really happening talk in your group is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what s coming that s making the stuff on the outside of the can there is water on the side of the can maybe the mystery thing making condensation on the can and because i learned a lot about that i think the mystery one and the ice did it together that could be yeah that could be and combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can i think that the water the mystery ingredient okay one two three four five number three what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff what s that wet stuff called ella condensation it s called condensation what do you why is that happening to your can number three that s you right luke okay what s happening because it s like evaporating and when it touches the cold can then it turns back into cold water what s evaporating stop don t answer that think in your group what he said it s evaporating and then it s touching the can what s touching the can talk in your group figure out if you can figure out what s coming to touch your can so well really it can yeah it s kind of melting so the water is on the can so it s the mushy icky i know whatever mystery stuff now i ll take it it makes me and then it makes water water water everything you know water how will eve s last question nope we re just asking questions right this second you guys need to wait then we re gonna one two three four five come back to me number 19 who s 19 ella okay ella what is happening to make that can wet on the outside the water and the ice well the water tries to evaporate but since there s ice at the top it hits the ice and then it comes back down but then it gets on the can so the water you think the water in the the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that hit the ice good thought let s keep going let s see if we can get some more who is number 12 hayden hayden s not here so let s move on and let s find number nine who s number nine kayla kayla kayla what s happening to your can what s happening to it and why it frosting it s frosting,1.0
okay guys good morning and welcome to class today we re going to continue our discussion on energy but we re going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven t talked about yet so what i d like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea the big idea for just a moment so the big idea that we re going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table so everybody s got their little stretchy lizard without shooting them we re not doing anything with them yet i d like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea i m going to give you and then we ll just go around and see what you think okay so 30 seconds to think about what s the big idea do you know who your spokesperson is going to be alright guys it s been 30 seconds i m going to go to each table if you could just have your spokesperson ready you could just tell me what your big idea is we re going to put it up here and we re going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we ve done alright so how about we ll start with you guys back here since there s just two of you alright what do you think shawn are you going to speak the sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table okay so the sun might warm up the lizard i just put l for lizard that s alright and make it go across the table robert how about your table who s your spokesperson going to be the energy from the sun once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy okay the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard right is that okay who s your spokesperson we said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table okay so it might make it melt and sticky and that ll make it shoot across the table is that what you said alright kendrick who s your spokesperson going to be blaire it was unanimous alright blaire what do you guys have we were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going is going to do what like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it s going to make it jump okay shine and make it jump nicole did you guys decide who your spokesperson s going to be arrington arrington the sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling okay so the sun gives energy and i didn t hear the last part you want to tell me that helps it that helps it okay and last but not least jada we think that the sun give heat to the and make it more elastic so it would stretch okay so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic i m sorry what was the last part again like make it more elastic so it will stretch more so it ll stretch farther good alright so what i d like to do now is i d like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy so if i call your number i would like you to think about what do you know about let s start with potential energy what do you know about potential energy so if i call your number just tell me one factor one thing that you know about it or an example of it alright we ll start with 15 when an object is like still it doesn t move it s holding it in okay still doesn t move it s holding it in how about number eight robert something you know about potential energy or an example of it the lizards alright very good when the lizard is still when it s moving what do you think still alright very good it s stored energy alright it s stored energy and i ll do one more number two potential energy an example or something that you remember about it the pencil is still the pencil is still alright very good now i know we haven t talked about these topics too much yet but i know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it okay the next thing i d like to know is what do you know what examples do you have what can you remember about kinetic energy so we talked about potential now i d like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy alright so if i call your number let me know what you think number 20 a car moving a car moving alright number 13 a paint can being dropped a paint can being dropped alright very good number 14 when you push a pencil and it rolls alright when you push a pencil and it rolls very good and how about number seven we ll do one more like the energy of motion like the the energy of motion yeah thanks alright and if i didn t call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic anybody have anything else to add about it dylan kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling alright very good and that s a great way to start into the next part what we re going to use the lizards for today alright so what i would like to know from you guys is everybody has a bucket on their table right um hum yeah teacher okay and you can raise your hand for this part how can you from your seat how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket anthony shoot it you can shoot it you can just toss it in you can just toss it in there you could pull its tail you could pull its tail and stretch it you could drop it in there you could just drop it in there it s not too far away anybody else okay how about and i m not asking for a demonstration yet we ll get to demonstration i promise how about if i asked you guys instead of in the bucket at your table how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor s table at your neighbor s table javious what do you think you could toss it you could toss it arrington you could sling it you could sling it wilson that was your idea alright walk over there and put it in it yeah that s true i didn t say you had to stay in your seat did i you could walk over there and just put it in gavin you could like throw it you might throw it is that what you were going to say dana alright shoot it you could shoot it alright very good you could bend it back yep you could bend it back and shoot very good how about if i asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other jade i ll start with you sling it you could sling it lewis like you said you could shoot it yeah you could shoot it anthony you could throw it you could throw it so we re kind of hearing the same things right we re kind of hearing go ahead you could walk over and drop it you could walk over and drop it i didn t say you had to stay in your seat alright what would be the difference though between the bucket at your table the bucket your neighbor s table shooting it across the room going out on the football field and going for distance what would be the difference between what you did what difference would you have between this bucket here the bucket at your neighbor s table and so forth john what do you think the amount of energy you re putting into it can you just show me without actually shooting it for example like if you re trying to get it into this bucket i only have to go like this or drop it in there if i were trying to send it across the room i d have to really stretch it out okay the distance away from the bucket okay so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance stretch it more i might stretch it further is that what you two were going to say the more potential energy or kinetic energy it has the more potential energy the more kinetic energy it has so when you talk about the lizard what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has how s it getting potential energy what does that mean before you sling it it s just sitting there alright so when it s just sitting there it s potential what about when you stretch it what do you think that is kinetic okay have you let it go yet no alright so we ll think about that for a little bit what i d like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table or if you don t like what they have to say you can think about it on your own i d like for you to make a hypothesis and i d like for your hypothesis to start with i think and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor s table what do you think you would do differently i think if i do what to the lizard it s going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table so make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one by slinging it yeah talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think alright i ll give you but then compare it to the next table as well what would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one that s what i want you to do okay alright so let me just have let s hear one table gavin i kind of liked what i was hearing from yours ready guys gavin i liked what i was hearing from your table when i was walking around tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis that if you were shooting it at your table you d only pull back a little bit but if you re shooting it across to another person s table you d have to pull it back farther okay any other table have a similar hypothesis so their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table and correct me if i m wrong they d only have to stretch it a little bit but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor s table they d have to stretch it further did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that you guys did how about you guys what did you say nicole we said that maybe we d have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables okay so not only the amount of stretch but also the trajectory of how you aim it alright very good how about you guys over there you d have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it alright very good and i know you guys were coming up with the same thing so we re going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly okay so if that s your hypothesis i think the amount of stretch that i give the lizard will make it fly a different length what would the manipulated variable be what would the thing be that you change between the different steps anthony how far you pull it back how far you pull it back very good how far you pull it or can i put stretch also good what would our dependent variable be what are you going to watch for how do you know if that stretch has made a difference jada alright very good and where else might it go right but you re talking about your bucket and you re also talking about very good so we re talking about distance alright so can i put that down for the dependent yes okay good how about some constants what are some things that have to stay the same guys don t let that table do all the work come on now alright ada the type of lizard the type of lizard very good would it be fair if i gave one table battery powered and the other table not right alright very good sierra what else the size and shape of it size and shape of it very good anything else that has to stay constant or the same how big is the container alright very good how big is the container wilson how stretchy it is okay how stretchy it is alright i m going to give you 30 seconds and what i would like for you to do with those 30 seconds is i d like for you to practice alright i d like for you to practice at this point just at your table if you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end that s fine but i would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area okay alright go ahead without hitting your neighbor maybe move to the side kendra go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference gavin see if you have some information when you re done besides that it sticks to your neighbor s head alright hold on and we ll try it again i promise we ll try it again at further distances in just a minute let s think guys can anyone make a conclusion that starts with when i change the amount of stretch can anyone make a conclusion that starts good job nicole when i change the amount of stretch if i change the amount of stretch far then it goes further okay if i change the amount of stretch when i make it further it goes further alright lewis you might plan for it to go one way but the way that you shoot it really it doesn t exactly go where you plan it s all over the place but if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance,1.0
okay you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday what we realized or what i realized is that there s still confusion on going from the general to factor general to vertex or vice versa on any of those three particular forms also another objective we re gonna do is we re gonna figure out determine why each form is important so the first thing i want you guys to do is i want you guys to look at number one on that task card can someone read it out loud i will yeah drew the angry bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters the bird s initial velocity was 14 7 meters per second write an equation that gives the height of the angry bird as a function of time okay so what i need you guys to do is i need you guys to write that equation on the white board okay so now i want people to put it up on the board okay okay so can you guys look around to each other too i know you guys are gonna want to like show everybody what people are getting yay cool okay guys these are the four things or the three things that i saw okay so right here so if you notice a lot of you guys you guys had the first one negative four point nine x squared plus 14 7 x plus 49 can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out you just did it what was the question so can someone tell me how like relate this general formula to the story since you ve read already i wants someone else to speak so who okay jamilah can you explain how you were able to get this equation so the height is c and the original equation is a x squared plus b x plus c and so the initial height is b which is the y intercept and then b is the initial velocity and then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose so you guys is it random no it s the scale factor is there any other terminology for that it s the starting point hey guys do you think it s the starting point is it the starting point or what else it s gravity so wait what does this negative four point nine mean that s the constant remember it s gravity so i heard scale factor okay scale factor but relatively to your projectile motion what is it acceleration acceleration so you guys it s acceleration so right now what i want you guys to do oh actually once again right here here are different forms of an equation that i saw so right here what do you think can someone tell me what s wrong with this particular one they don t have a squared and they don t have an x after the 4 2 okay so ravelle what s the problem with this one there s no y intercept or so once again i still notice now i want to go back to the original equation okay someone tell me in words ah jamilah she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a x squared plus b x plus c but according to the story can someone refer to the story back to the general equation can you rephrase the question yes how are we able to get 14 7 here how did we get 49 here how do you know what stuff to use the 49 is the initial height in meters so that one s gonna be your y intercept and 14 7 is the initial velocity and the initial velocity is always b so awesome so now what i want you guys to do is i want you to go to number two so i want you to put that on the white board can i read it again well actually no let s have fatima can you read number two what does the x axis represent in this story what does the y axis represent in our story okay let s do that quickly i have a question yes did x never mind i ll wait until after this so let s look around so a lot of people are getting what x equals time y equals height so markeisha what was your question i was gonna say could x be distance as well can x be distance people no no if it wanted to why not because it s meters per second not meters per so does that make sense all right so now what i want you guys to do so so far let s recap what we ve done so far can everyone generalize what we ve just done in the first couple of questions we set up the equation and we figured out our x and y axes in the general form okay right now what i want you guys to do is i want you guys to work on number four okay someone read that out loud that hasn t read out loud yet i haven t so leslie you want to read number four from the equation that you got from question number one show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form now what i want you guys to do i want you to turn and talk about the strategies you re planning to use to work out this problem okay you guys i m gonna stop class real quick you guys i m gonna stop class real quick okay so mary can you just ask the question that you just asked me she asked me okay so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about so markeisha jamilah can we use the box to figure it out yeah you can why how hang on put that back away so you guys so the question is okay so autumn just asked can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to and why you guys you guys let s listen please mary sorry you figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers so if you divide negative four point nine x squared by negative four point nine you ll get x squared 14 7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three and then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten okay i ll stop you right there so back to what i said okay so the diamond rectangle method people so when you are doing this what are you finding we re finding the box you re finding the box so what are those things outside of the box here what are they called the factors the factors okay okay when you re using it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula what are you trying to find then all right so right now so autumn so you have questions on that right so later on so do you mind just moving over there real quick because leslie said that you got it down so you guys so take two more minutes we re gonna see both methods so are you done yet no okay you guys stop okay right now i m gonna put this up right here we re gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do okay so right now so how many people got negative five and two no no no so what was it negative two oh okay i got negative two and five my bad okay so right now what do you think was the mistake that she did she didn t square it she didn t what she didn t square and then she re fixed it she fixed it yeah she copied mine it s supposed to be negative 14 7 is that what its supposed to be yeah and is that what she s missing yeah okay guys so that s one mistake that happens quite a bit also let s look at hey you guys what form is this right here what method did they use box and diamond method box and diamond method right okay so you guys what do you call these two items right here what is it missing the number at the beginning the negative four and what is that again what is the name of the four point nine again scale factor or what acceleration acceleration so you guys if you notice this is something that tends to be missing also so now we will look at ah we have the same thing we all have the same thing so same thing same thing all right okay so right now i think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend oh actually so now what i want is so how many methods do people use two okay so tell me one what was one method what was the method that you used quadratic formula okay caleb what was another method that people used the box and diamond the box and diamond right so right now i want people to explain their thinking so what i want you to do is okay since tiffany since you said you did the quadratic formula you re gonna go up and talk about it just talk about the process of what you did how are you gonna explain the process all right so the can we do it on this hard board yeah okay let s do it on this hard board make sure you talk to us okay okay while you re writing things down talk about how you re going through the process so i used the quadratic formula so what are you doing right now i m writing it writing what the quadratic formula okay so you see instead of me asking i just want you to explain all the things that you re doing okay so you guys need some visuals this will be your a your b and your c so you plug all this into this okay so let s do it i have a question yes what if the b is already negative that s a good question so you guys while tiffany is doing the quadratic formula think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier and what mistakes that she may or may not have,1.0
okay so write your conjectures down denominators are repeating actually let s put this one on number four put it on number four we got any even number that had any odd number okay so if it s an odd number in the denominator it s repeating if it s got an even number in the denominator oh okay so you want to add to it not just say it s even if it s odd over even it s terminating it s terminating and what if it s even over even even over even two over six it would one be one over three you d have to simplify it okay you d have to simplify it and so what would happen when you simplified 2 6 to 1 3 it would be repeating it would be repeating so maybe you re on to something might want to record that let s check that s good i haven t heard that one before guys all right let me here some of your conjectures this group we re going with their conjecture what s your conjecture guys that all odd denominator fractions will repeat all right here s the conjecture all odd numbers in the denominator will be repeating decimals anybody want to add to it take away from it change it all right what we got here over here that s false because point two five goes into 100 4 times okay hold on i m confused point two five what is point two five represented as a fraction 1 4 1 4 and they said all odd numbers are repeating so far it works well then 1 5 all right let s try 1 5 well hold on then let s get all the conjectures before we start trying them out i do love the action that you want to make up your own fractions and try it cause i don t think it s safe just to take it at a glance all right dylan what did y all s group george share for your group what did y all say listen guys we had two you had two okay even over odd equals terminating even over odd is terminating okay and even over even is repeating even over even is repeating he meant two by that okay so basically and then i would assume that odd over odd would go here okay my only question is i see even over odd odd over odd even over even what s the other option odd over even odd over even where do you think that would go do you think it would go terminating yes well let s pick something really quick 3 4 that s odd over even that would be terminating okay so opposites even and odd odd and even you re thinking opposites attract there you go opposites attract to be terminating and when they re the same even and even and odd and odd they repel okay and they repeat pretty good here s what i want you to do now based on what you just told me look at number six i ve given you fractions i want you let s look at them as a group i want to come to a consensus as a class do we all agree with this groups thinking we didn t get to share ours because 8 9 repeat okay 8 9 is even over odd and that repeats so maybe we want to cancel this one out and it s just odd over even there might be something else it might be that that doesn t go necessarily doing anything like the rules for divisibility like seven and eight they don t have a rule because it just doesn t work but it s right it might be that that doesn t work maybe if it s even a law you just gotta work it out so do we want to make our rule this if it s odd over eating eating is it time for lunch if it s odd over even it s terminating everything else is repeating we should test it out before 3 4 is terminating but 7 8 isn t terminating cause eight 7 8 try it on your paper real quick 7 8 it terminates so do we want to use this no and yes okay let s let s do more though let s do a democracy here okay if you re liking the well hold on who says no who doesn t want to use this why those rules may not work all the time for every fraction okay so do you have a better rule or conjecture so far is it working based on what we know and the numbers we ve generated so far let s use that rule to categorize the following fractions and i think we could do this as a group so here i ve got our rule we said we wanted to try was odd over even everything else is going in repeating odd over even we ve already done these so here s our new fractions okay what is this fraction here 11 24 it s odd over even so where do we want to put it terminating terminating terminating odd over even would make it terminating six what sevenths 6 7 repeating even over odd terminates but that didn t work that didn t work we tried it and we saw that it didn t work remember yeah odd over even is the only one we re going with so i ve got an odd over even i got odd over odd repeating and i ve got an odd over even terminating okay so here s what i want you to do check it use your calculators as a group check it circle go ahead and write em down categorize them just like i did on the board write em in your chart and circle any that don t belong use your calculator it doesn t work odd over even it doesn t work oh no which one doesn t work seven over six doesn t work all right let s do this then the 6 7 were we correct there all right this one s right no this one was repeating or terminating terminating all right so this one we need to move over here all right 5 13 i haven t checked haven t check that one five divided by 13 we don t know too many decimals okay if it s too many what do you think it s going to be repeating probably going to be repeating so that one looks good let s do this hold on i want you guys to try 11 24 i want you to do 15 14 i want you to check 199 over 200 and i want you all to check nine over 80 these rules already tested out that s terminating the rules weren t tested enough to be proven i think my rule is solid even though it s kind of condensed five four three two one thank you all right 11 24 it stays all right it repeats so it goes over here all right 15 14 repeating all right let me change this though let s change this one to 15 24 check that one and while they re checking point 625 point 625 so it s actually going to terminate okay repeating or terminating terminating it terminated and nine over 80 terminating terminating okay so it didn t work so odd over even doesn t work right it didn t work so let s think about it then we got a do you know a rule i don t know so i m kind of doing this with you let s look at this what is important do you think the numerator is important well if the numerator s what s important i think they re evenly important they re evenly important without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction do you agree he said without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction what do you mean by that you said which one s important if you say the numerator s important then if you change the denominator it might not work so they re not the same fraction without one another okay if the numerator is one less than the denominator then it will be repeating if the numerator is one less than the denominator what about 5 13 that s just one rule there s multiple right well i want to come up with just one rule that works for them all so let s look at this if the numerator is what s important can we not look at these two fractions here what do they both have in common they both have a common denominator and they have different numerators and it s actually put em in two separate categories but they re both odd prime number oh you re seeing something about prime number if it s prime over even it ll be repeating but a prime over an even would be okay so we re gonna do prime over even is which one repeating prime over even is repeating okay because even number has what factor in it automatically two a two and will a prime number have two as a factor a prime number will have two as a factor what are the factors of prime numbers one and itself the only problem with that is the number what two two okay so i think you re on to something if it s prime over even then it ll be repeating prime over even then it s repeating i found a problem with that here s what i want you to do i did 11 over eight 11 over eight it s prime over even okay it is a mix number it s not a mixed number i m sorry it s a improper fraction what would it need to be a mixed number a whole number and a fractional part good job all right so here s my question then here s what i want you to do look up here and i think with fractions we always seem to stress when we re doing equivalent fractions to put a fraction in its what simplest form simplest form anytime there s a prime number it s already going to be in its simplest form right cause you can t reduce it anymore so these are already in their simplest forms what about 15 24 is there a factor that they both have in common three three okay so if i factor out three out of fifteen five i got a five eight so that s an equivalent fraction so i m going to get rid of that odd over even so maybe we could say in a fraction s what simplest form simplest form in a fraction s simplest form if it s odd over even then it what terminates terminates so are we doing a rule that applies to every number every single number so if we were to make a conjecture do we just base it off of six numbers no what i want you to do is i want you as a group to come up with your own example that can either prove this or disprove this conjecture the conjecture is that a fraction in its simplest form if it s odd over even will terminate i want every group to make up their own as a group make up your own example let s do 7 6 you make up your own buck you make up your own you got notebook paper if you want it i made it up so can we do it again no i want a new one they haven t seen so 5 6 5 6 okay try 5 6 is it in simplest form yes okay and so it actually repeats it disproves the theory so it disproves it doesn t it,1.0
now what you just did was count how many times you made a successful eric you made a successful throw and how many times you made a successful catch out of 10 all right we re going to use that information that you just gathered to answer the questions on this form that you ve got you each should have your own reflection sheet all right and i m going to allow you to as a group as a partnership i m going to allow you to talk about the answers together which is just fine because with your partner helping you you might learn something about your throwing ability or catching ability that you might not have picked up on your own all right so now if you look at the backside if you start here each of you should have your sheet in front of you ok and you should have a pencil or you have and i m going to read this to you to help you best understand it this is a chart to help you gauge your abilities and for your progress from the start of throwing the frisbee up to this point it s broken up into four categories one you see where i m pointing at here it says beginning two developing three proficient and four excellent so the question you have to ask yourself is am i still in beginning stages of throwing frisbee in other words do i use correct frisbee throwing form sometimes two it says do i use correct form some to most of the time three proficient do i use correct form when throwing the frisbee or catching the frisbee most of the time and four excellent do i use correct form all of the time all right so this is what you are going to test yourself on i ll read it to you and as i read it to you i want you to mark the boxes again you can talk to your partner and make this assessment with your partner if you d like so sitting with your partner you re talking about it i m going to read it as we go number one movement do you move to meet the frisbee s expected location are you at the beginning stages of that developing stages proficient stages or are you excellent at it do you always move to meet the frisbee s location sometimes most of the time or rarely give yourself a check in the box of where you think that belongs body position ok this is how you position yourself to the oncoming frisbee aside from moving to it this is how you square your body with it are you in the beginning stages where you rarely do it well are you in the developing stages where you do it sometimes the proficient stages where you do it most of the time or are you in the excellent stage where you do it all of the time ask yourself that question feel free to discuss it with your partner all right so you should be checking the boxes you should be checking the boxes that s right there the boxes are already checked next hand position when catching the frisbee do you use proper hand positioning with your palms together fingers opening rarely that makes you in the beginning stage sometimes that s your developing stage do you do it most of the time that puts you in the proficient stage do you do it always that puts you in the excellent stage what do you think what is your target what would you put a grade on now when it comes to the throwing the same things apply your stance and your elbow are you at the beginning and i m not going to go into detail with each one of these now i think you get the idea of how these check are you at the beginning stage the developing stage the proficient stage or the excellent stage when it comes to your stance and your elbow position when it comes to wrist snap and point ok what stage are you at are you rarely sometimes mostly or always again beginning developing proficient or excellent and then lastly when it comes to releasing the frisbee what stage do you think you re at the beginning the developing the proficient or the excellent so i want you to just think about that reflect on that but i m not grading you on this i m not grading you on your ability hey mike would you sit up for me thanks bud i want you just to reflect on what you have learned and your ability all right now with your partner i want you to turn the page over and it says frisbee throw reflections ok and then we have some questions that we need to answer we discussed what angular momentum was we discussed what force absorption was and we discussed what force reduction was with your partner i want you to answer those questions that you see one through seven number one why is angular momentum important two describe force reduction three describe force absorption four considering you don t have to do this i m just reading them out loud before you do it considering the fitness components of speed agility endurance and balance to which sports would you compare ultimate frisbee if you think about when we were playing ultimate the game of ultimate what sports would you compare that to football no you have do it with your partner and a couple more questions where can frisbee be played for fun what are two popular frisbee activities that you are aware of you already know one that we played in class you might know of another two and then lastly based on the activity you did just before we sat here how many times did you catch your frisbee out of 10 and how many times did you accurately throw the frisbee out of 10 ok so go ahead with your partner and go ahead and start answering those questions to the best of your ability you guys should be working off one another and sharing your answers ready set go do we basically no just rewrite it force absorption you absorb the force when you describe force absorption yeah ok start with that and maybe go a little farther and describe what makes it to learn today we re going to begin a unit on indoor ultimate frisbee and we ve got the indoor soft styrofoam frisbee all right one thing about the frisbee i want you to understand number one it s styrofoam that means you can easily break them all right please don t bend them like i m doing here any more than i just did obviously tugging on them pulling them poking them is going to harm the frisbee you want it to be intact so just use the frisbee as it s meant to be used and don t play with it in any other way okay so that way we keep the frisbee in good shape now here is the question we want to answer why do frisbees fly a lot of different reasons and a lot of these reasons have to do with the concept of flight all right like an airplane like a helicopter or a paper airplane okay now frisbee flight s a little different than some other types of flight firstly we re going to look at this angular momentum big word but the concept of angular momentum essentially means that frisbees fly one of the reasons why frisbees fly and maintain stability in flight is because they spin so the fact that the frisbees spin is called angular momentum all right and again that s what produces stability in the air you find angular momentum in a lot of things you guys ever use a top a spinning top yes at home that s an act of a football as a top if i just balance this football it ll fall right it doesn t remain upright but when i spin the football like a top it maintains its upright position that is angular momentum that is why it does not fall down the force of friction will eventually slow down the football and that s why it will topple over and fall but while it s spinning angular momentum is what keeps it up when a frisbee spins the reason why it doesn t wobble in flight and fall from the air is because it s supposed to spin as you can see there and that s what keeps it stable that s also what helps us to throw it accurately another concept is angular lift angular lift like an airplane there s different pressures above and below the wing these concepts are really complicated if you look into them in detail but the basic gist of this concept is that there s a low pressure on top and a high pressure on the bottom and when i throw the airplane that pressure difference is what gives it lift and allows it to fly okay now one thing i m going to do before i throw this airplane is i m going to use force force production i produce force behind the plane and that allows it to fly in the same way i will produce force behind the frisbee and that will allow it to fly the other end is force absorption which we ll talk about in just a minute so again aerodynamic lift is when the pressure differences allow this airplane to lift and i m going to produce force for that to happen can i go get it no we ll leave that there all right now i need one person to demonstrate how to throw the frisbee properly julia please i ll have you stand here now watch you re going to listen i m going to go over this one time with you and then you re going to use these checklists on the cones to teach one another how to do it properly now i know a lot of you listen please i know a lot of you would like when you do the frisbee you can throw the frisbee but there s one the difference between really just throwing the frisbee and understanding how to throw the frisbee understanding the mechanics behind it okay so the mechanics behind throwing a frisbee are just this the mechanics behind a frisbee are this number one i need to know my target two when throwing a frisbee you step with the same foot not the opposite foot like when you throw a baseball but rather i step with the same foot i m going to point my elbow at my target i m going to curl my wrist and bring the frisbee across my chest girls i need you to pay attention if you miss this instruction it s going to be more complicated later so i m going to step towards my target frisbee curled up to my chest and then point my elbow at my target now when i extend my elbow i m going to snap my wrist that s going to create the spin that gives this one two three angular momentum angular momentum and that s what s going to give it stability so i m going to step point the elbow snap the wrist point to my target produce force and on the other end what julia s going to do once i throw it is she s going to use force absorption she s going to catch it fundamentals of catching julia what i d like you to do is square yourself with the frisbee if the frisbee moves to your right i want you to move to your right okay if it moves to your left i want you to move to your left because you want to meet it and square your body to it and last i want you to put your hands in this position palms together and fingers out all right they don t have to be touching but we re going to try to pancake the frisbee all right hopefully my throw goes well here we go step elbow oh wrist snap release one more thing i forgot to mention release it level with the ground if i release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way if i release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way so release it level one more thing to remember ready step nice try don t laugh don t laugh all right i want you to try the same thing i want you to step with the same foot point your elbow in and when you throw throw it point your finger at me remember to release it level you re ready go yes it s all right you can grab it with one hand there s no problem with that that frisbee had good spin on it all right she released it did she release it level no no that s why it bounced off the wall one more time step elbow wrist snap point release level good catch nice one dude here you go you got it perfect now i could have moved to the side a little bit to catch that frisbee but i did a little reach and that s okay too all right so with your groups of four remember wait wait wait you re going to coach your partner in throwing and catching use the checklist on the cones ready set grab one frisbee go can i stand here you and you here you re going to be here you guys are all working together you re going to hold this wait wait wait there should be two on each cone one person holding the cone stop where s your partner you re going to coach her throwing you re going to go first and i want you to catch it and then throw it to her and you re going to be catching and every couple tries we re going to switch okay pick up your cone and coach pick up your cone you re the instructor he s going to catch right all right you re the instructor you should watch her one two three frisbee make sure you re reading and helping all right practice a couple times and three stop stop stop stop now with the catch with the force absorption okay you re absorbing that throw listen i know that the throws aren t all going to be accurate that s all the more reason why you have to move to where you think the frisbee s going to land and meet the oncoming frisbee okay so with your partner s help coach s help keep practicing and we re going to switch in just a minute make sure you correct any improper technique,1.0
and your ideas and we re learning from each other right because a lot of times who do we learn from you each other you learn from me but who else do you learn from us you learn from each other okay kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen we re going to watch another weather forecast and as you re viewing this i want you to pay really close attention to how she talks how she speaks okay as a good listener and a viewer what are some things that we need to concentrate on while we re watching this how she her face her expression and how she moves and looks okay and how are you going to find out if she does those things by watching her you re going to be watching her okay sarah watch how her body is moving because watch her eyes okay catch your eye and i like that you said watching what are you doing while you re watching are you just staring at the screen no you are looking at them and you re making eye contact and you re looking you re watching their mouths because there are people who can t really hear so they would read people s mouths and that s really important to do anything else that you can do while you re viewing this listening okay and how are you going to be listening we talked about this a lot how are we going to listen with our ears and with our whole entire bodies with our whole entire bodies why are we going to listen with our whole entire body naomi because if we re listening with our ears then our hands are up here saying oh i ve got something to say then you re not really listening you re not really listening competently all right can you go ahead and hit play for us please yup just like you did yesterday good afternoon i m julie wunder with your forecast a north wind five to ten miles per hour tonight 28 it s going to be partly cloudy out and we can head to a 7 day forecast about a 50 percent chance of rain transitioning over to some snow overnight saturday and into sunday temperatures fall next week what a cold forecast we have coming up at 5 o clock we ll have the latest on that possibility of snow turn and talk to your buddy we re going to do two right here two two two i noticed that under one of the clouds we had snow instead of rain turn your face okay and what kind of body language did she use she was pointing and so why do you think she was pointing like that okay and because you saw her looking at you did that make you listen any differently did it help you listen more or less when she looked away what was she doing alright so why do you think she wasn t doing this okay like you say she was like why is that would you be listening as well if she were making those faces or would you her face right not necessarily what she was saying but you were focusing on her expressions alright guys let s come back in three two and one okay you guys had some amazing things that you saw when you watched this little clip what kind of things did you notice tell me what you and your buddy were talking about we used this chart if she was just like there she was pointing at it so then it made me understand more but if she was just like there when you did your presentation what did you feel like you were looking at my poster you looked at your poster the whole time okay and the second time when you did your presentation again you said you were really focusing on your eye contact were you able to achieve that goal no no why not because i was looking at my poster again you say you were looking at your poster again okay why do you think you did that were you nervous what do you think you could ve done to ease that nervousness take a breath going to take a breath what do you guys think what could adrian have done to maybe be a little less nervous when he was doing his presentation he could think about somewhere he was comfortable okay think about somewhere where s he s comfortable picture everyone else in their underwear oh underwear sarah be himself and just act like it s just any other day the information we were presenting was it a little bit more in depth than what we usually talk about what do you think was the topic you were sharing a little bit you have a little bit more information than if you were just sitting here having a conversation yeah so that make some of us nervous that we have a lot of information trying to remember yes and then was anyone able to get over that nervousness okay sarah how were you guys able to get over that nervousness i followed my goals and i just tried to be myself i just followed my goals and i just had fun okay do you want to show us part of your presentation where you did that mhmm avril will you move the book away from the projector while she gets the computer ready alright make sure you get to a spot where you can see got it my project is about legends of the i m going to start over with werewolves people think that i don t know why because wolves howl at the moon this is a werewolf a full moon is sometimes called a wolf s moon since its yellow this one is my favorite it s about she calls her brother helius to find her sister herse the study of geography to the moon is called selenology okay this is this is vampires vampires are said to come out on every moon except for new moon i guess because they can see better this is a vampire person trying to get his girlfriend to become a vampire this is people people think to people that are aggressive and violent this is a witch from okay turn to your buddy for a second do you think she was able she said she acted like she was comfortable like it was just any other day yeah talk to your buddy about that do you think that she accomplished that goal yes because she s a pretty funny girl right alright let s come back together let s come back together please alright so her goal she said that she wanted to be more comfortable and she was just going to act like it was any other day did she accomplish that yes okay how do we know that she accomplished that what do you think arizona because she was really comfortable with her surroundings and those people just wanted to get their talking over with and done but sarah actually talked like we were just talking face to face acting like the camera wasn t even there okay and as a listener how did sarah s confidence make you listen better did it make you listen better or did it not make you listen better it did okay why did it make you listen better levin because it was fun because it was fun okay and what made it fun she was acting like the way she was acting the way she was acting okay what did you think dillon because she s usually funny and she was being quite funny on this okay and i like to yup alright anybody else what were some other goal that you guys created sit up and join the circle please alright let s see someone i haven t heard from yet isabelle what was one of your goals one of my goals was to stop making really distracting movements because i was like twisting it and twirling it and i was really nervous alright so that was the first time you did your presentation you felt you were doing too many movements yeah and so your goal was to cut down on that and why did you choose that as a goal really when we watched my first video we decided that she said that she was kind of watching that and she couldn t really have her attention stay on what i was saying and did you agree with her mhmm okay so what did you do with your second presentation i really was concentr,1.0
in case you think there s something missing and then we ll see what you got okay the tongue does with the the tongue oh yeah because the trachea will swallow it no the trachea s the air the esophagus close your the esophagus is the food pipe for the thing no the esophagus is the thing that stops the food the esophagus is the food part the windpipe is the trachea you talking about the epiglottis oh the epiglottis that s the flap of skin that stops it food going down your trachea your air passageway so you don t choke right how do you spell that how do you spell what are you gonna put that in there somewhere well here s what i m talking about you only need four people in this group and you don t have as many pieces of paper don t take more without asking why are you taking more why because tyler got on it go wash it in the sink i ll mark down on my clipboard who s having trouble with self control go to the sink and wash it with soap and water all right so you guys do not have the same number of papers that they have at the other table because you only have four people so i m gonna let you add more if you feel that you could add a few more pieces to fill it out more go for it and then i ll check in with y all in just a minute add head yeah but she said it has to be a word what s another word for stomach acid stomach acid acid why don t you put acid that could be anything in your stomach stomach acid s kinda like a compound word well actually since stomach s already here and if we put acid right here you can t just say it s any kind of acid yeah because it s going down the mouth to the throat to the and they have acid in the stomach well that s the intestine duh acid i m gonna stop you right now because we wanna take this to another level but what i have is i have several groups with several different ways of looking at it what seems to be a common thread among some of you is to order things to put them in an order of sequence i had one group that grouped them so what i m asking is that i m still seeing a little bit of food in there and i m still seeing that you ve got processes some people have processes in there and body parts we got lots of body parts so what i m gonna ask you to do is if we could put if we could create a big system on the board with the pieces and if there are duplicates this is why i didn t want you sticking em too much we just put it on top so i m gonna ask you to do this this is gonna be tricky we re not gonna have a lot of time so i m gonna ask you to bring by groups your post its and put them on the board this is our work space so if you think it should be in out five groups four of you think it should be in a linear kind of grouping so we re gonna go with the sequence of events order so what i want you to do is put em on the board and let s look at what you ve got if there s duplicates put it on top if there s something you have that s different figure out where if you can move something can it share a space does it happen at the same time we talked about it over there what three things did you have esophagus throat and neck so they thought those were on equal grounds that they were all either in the same place or the same function i wasn t sure i didn t ask them but they ve got them together so this is gonna be hard it s real easy sitting there with your group of five or six or four people now you ve gotta work with twenty four twenty three okay so we re gonna start with group one and if you can just come stick em on the board and i m gonna get group four next and you ll go up with them so you have to make one picture on this board that shows me how you think they fit if you wanna put them in the same order don t make them touch leave enough room for manipulations yes no pardon the abdomen is the middle the butt is the fleshy part the anus is the actual opening and the rectum is the tube yeah so it s very distinct differences they can t interchange all right so just stick em on and then move quickly got em all right got em on that s why i said they re not going to stick well if you keep sticking them on your face and get the oil from your face all right make sure you agree now you re gonna go up there with your post it notes you may need to use some of their pieces you re welcome to move any of their pieces to fit in since you re coming up there after them and the group that comes after you will be free to move any of your pieces okay all right y all pay attention all right got em all right can you do me a favor and plan before you get up here how you re gonna do it so we can make it move quickly all right guys have a seat now they don t they have some words you don t have so how are you gonna make this work you gonna put yours up above it we re gonna put ours in our order we could fit their s in there there you go however you wanna do it come up and get their voices what s next mouth water where s water i think we need mouth i have teeth tongue then teeth mouth i have taste buds it was tongue teeth then chewing it was tongue then teeth saliva it was saliva saliva chewing i think it was tongue then saliva no it was tongue taste buds saliva teeth then chew and then i think it was esophagus next i have intestine stomach and waste stomach and then intestines and then waste and then kidney no put em on the same all right we put theirs up now teeth intestines i m gonna leave you guys for last over there you have a smaller group i m gonna leave you for last all right all right so health health should be overall i guess it s like yeah yeah you get health from eating proteins go with food no yeah nutrients how are you doing it s kind of hard to put this in the same group with so you were looking linear and now it s hard to go linear because they ve thrown these other things in yeah you have a scrap board what do you do you might wanna build off that s what i m saying or like switching some some of them are very vague and that s exactly it if they re vague you re not quite sure how they tie in you weren t there for their discussion so you don t know what their train of thought was so make it work and realize that somebody s gonna come behind you and they might change it let s put protein and nutrients but health is overall all right this is getting very interesting their strategy you have to realize and i ll make the point while we re waiting for them to finish because they re having their own discussions when you have your discussion with your group your having a discussion with a small group so when you get up there and you see a word and you weren t there for the discussion that brought that word into the list you weren t there you don t know what their thinking was so just like we always say you can t disregard somebody s input because you don t believe it should be there you have to find a way oh i m sorry i m sorry thank you i need you next because y all have the next least amount thank you for catching that you have to make sure that what you do doesn t lose the meaning or change the meaning and doesn t judge somebody else s input you have to just make it work grab it if you know where it goes all right but if by some chance that s what happens when you start stacking we can use this masking tape in little tiny pieces all right go for it ooh are you all right is it still working you re fine yes we re okay you lost a nose we dropped a nose a nose but you see it s ok it may not have stood out in your discussion and you might have brought something to the discussion that they didn t y all gotta talk louder okay nose should be here literally put it right on top of it stomach okay teeth chewing epiglottis esophagus wait esophagus esophagus wait if you have to move something or if you think it needs to be this is the esophagus in other words if you think you have to move something over to fit yours in because it s not there and then intestines and then acid this word s already here so right after the mouth then intestines and then to the kidneys and then to the waste and then health do you wanna move it somewhere else if you think something should be on the same plain i just use the example of scrabble game with them i think saliva i think water and food once you put it into your mouth you re gonna get saliva okay so see what they did so if you feel like you need to move anything we need to get saliva back in there so how s saliva gonna work saliva goes with taste buds and mouth and tongue put it like in the middle okay it should stick wait discuss go ahead tell them what you think it looks like are y all ready are you almost ready no you do know the more that get up there the harder it gets so you re making it harder for us no i m making it harder for them oh all right i m coming got it they have like three on intestines let s put a little piece of tape to hold up the intestines yeah just stick a little piece up at the top it doesn t matter and can you add this to the waste so it doesn t fall all right you guys good okay go all right how are y all doing out there are you watching this unfold yeah and group one i mean three group three you guys look at the task ahead of you it s gotten bigger i need tape all right i m gonna give you a little bit i d like you not to put too much on the board more on the paper you have to figure out if you have a duplicate then just tape it over the top of it anything that s duplicate all right all right i need tape you need tape all right so where do you put stomach all right so he s got a question about where to put stomach no i have stomach acid i m seeing where she s putting stomach it s over here this is acid all right so it s way down there so move down there i need some tape and i will tell you the same thing i told the other two groups think about scrabble so if you have to go in a different direction to make something work you just go in a different direction you make it work okay you guys have the hardest job or it might be the easiest mucus where does the gallbladder go what is that epiligotis oh my bad but look how much came out that s good we didn t have that much expansion on that idea before all we had was body parts can we have tape for two what do you need two pieces of tape all right two pieces of tape all right how we doing emily where do i put mucus mucus goes with the in between the neck thing is that everything all right y all ready would you do me a favor and tell mr dresser we need five more minutes you have a test oh tell him three minutes thank you so we need three minutes you got it okay i think it s good all right ready guys all right have a seat okay now everybody goes up last group take your papers go i need a band aid for what to put over my your what let me look and see if i have one sometimes you have those little bitty ones okay i will look if you need them thank you all right if you re stacking it and it won t stick i have tape here stick your mouth on that mouth this we can put over this can we change this yes use this all right you got it here just put it like that all right how are y all doing what do you have left why don t you alex would you lift up health and move my volcanoes just slide the volcano down it ll come off just slide it down now you can do it that way do you need more tape all right how are we doing in case it doesn t stick got it all right now i want you to while you are waiting and i appreciate the patience that you guys have had i want you to watch and look at what it looks like now because some of you made some significant placements and they ve made some significant changes to that so take a look at what the resulting image is here y all finished wait don t you think this should be over there that s right they get to you have your perspective and they re bringing theirs to it and they had what could have been the hardest part or the easiest part okay i wanna pick up on one thing that you guys said because one of the things that you had when you came here and the group was already had already laid all this out was that they felt strongly that the mouth needed to be here so why because food goes in there paging mrs dalton dalton come in i m sorry hold on try it again like if you re eating something like a hamburger or you re drinking water it s gonna go straight to your mouth and then it goes in there so in the order that we ve established here do you see what they did do you agree with that yeah is it logical yeah ok is there anything else that you placed that you recognize was changed and you wanna know why it was changed or you went oh because i did hear a lot of oh we didn t think of that when you were watching these things go up like at first i thought that that should go before that don t know that i don t know what that is um the glucose water and food okay this column of yes i thought that that should go before the mouth because i was like but don t you put it in don t you put the food in your mouth and they were like yeah but once it enters your body it s not first in the okay using that logic is there anything else that should be adjusted blair uh where the nose is okay what do you think we should do with that you should put the nose right before the mouth or after because it s like you kinda smelled it before you put it in your mouth so would this be logical if i moved this over and put this here like he suggested yes i want to disagree you disagree you re welcome to smelling it is not a part of digesting it at all yeah that s what i said is growling a part of digesting it no it s the way your body reacts to the smell if we use your logic i m not saying remember the way we work things in here is that you can t judge if it s right or wrong you can certainly disagree with it that s true i may disagree but this is your work this is not for me to this is what you re thinking so but using the logic you used growling light headed and dryness in mouth is not a part of digestion but what do these things have in common i saw someone what do these things here have in common they re symptoms of hunger ok so you re calling them symptoms of hunger what else might they be indicators indicators is there another word signals signals if you have stomach growling you feel light headed you have a dryness in your mouth that s a signal right and where does the nose fit in to that and i ll come back to you you have an answer for my question with the nose or you have something else to add like the nose the nose indicates that you re allowed to put food in your mouth and so you prepare with the saliva so you can help break it down so the nose so if you can t smell it s like when you have a cold you can t really taste things okay but does the saliva not flow because you can t smell because you said you need to smell to be able to get the saliva to break it down so if you can t smell if you have a stuffy nose or if you don t have a sense of smell does that stop the saliva no no she said i don t know and that s an okay answer she doesn t know you could have an opinion,1.0
they died because no co2 two snails so if add another plant in there is that going to add co2 or is it going to take away more co2 takeaway you could probably try it with the lights off why do you think that would work umm maybe it might give them some more co2 okay well why don t you write down your predictions so she said turn the lights off and see what happens so did your snail coordinate with your prediction yeah but for long not for long all right haley so look at your prediction this is your setup isaiah can you go shut the door for me okay so number e stay alive stay alive not number letter e it lived okay why do you think but is also in unstable environment i thought plants needed sunlight to live how are they still alive and then they died when when you because there was no light it was light tell me what you said i had no idea wait never mind what do you think it s a miracle it s a miracle why don t you go back to your prior knoweldge here what did we say you didn t answer some of those but what do you think obviously something is making co2 right cause that started at six right if we hit carbon reset look it starts at six and six we re even if i hit play look what s happening what s happening to the co2 level it s getting bigger yeah why is it getting bigger where s that co2 coming from who s making it the plants okay why are they making it so they can live okay what s that called like what process is that when they make co2 photosynthesis photosynthesis makes co2 i guess no isn t it cellular res per tation ms rutala isn t it that respiration you know how we talked about this this is photosynthesis right carbon dioxide plus water in the sun is going to make glucose and oxygen right for respiration they re taking that exact same glucose and that oxygen and they re making three things they re going to make energy to stay alive that s why those plants are still living they re going to make co2 which is why they re still living uh huh and why there s a high number in there and they re also going to make h2o which is water does that make sense do you see now why those numbers are going up for co2 yeah cause they re going through photosynthesis no cause their going through the energy co2 respiration respiration is the process do you see that yeah all right you re welcome all right how are we doing here good you guys are still ready to predict the second part okay how are we doing here we just now got to the back that s okay you take your time this is good take your time as long as you are understanding that s the whole point of this okay so move on to this one what is a new question you have or an experiment you would want to do the snail one well what s the snail one what s a question you have based on what you just did are you curious about something what s a new question or a new experiment you d want to try how come well i just want to know why the snail keeps dying okay you can put that down why does the snail keep dying did it die in every single situaiton though no everyone we ve done so far you might want to think about why which situations it died in right all right let s see put your head up all right you guys are still in this one test tube c2 has plants and snails but resulted in an unstable environment why i thought plants and snails helped each other live why did they die because they didn t have that much what s it called oxygen well when they started the test tube it was at six and six all of them start at six six right so look at test tube c2 to plants two snails the lights are off the o2 level at the end of the experiment is 12 oh oh it s at what zero point zero point zero which means there is no oxygen so does that make sense as to why one of these died the snail was the one the snails died uh huh and then the co2 level is at 12 12 did the plants die no why didn t they die but the snails died because the snails gave off their co2 um hmm and why did that keep the plants alive because they take in co2 uh huh okay but it somehow they didn t give off o2 i guess why is that somehow why weren t they able to give off o2 because the lights weren t on uh huh and why are the lights so important to produce photosynthesis yes they need light for photosynthesis remember this is like a recipe right you have to have all three ingredients to make photosynthesis work you have to have carbon dioxide you have to have water and you have to have sunlight you can t just have one of the three you can t have two of the three you have to have all three do you see why that works okay good um hmm okay good all right how are we doing here we re passing let me ask you yeah i did not she was in the bathroom i went to go blow my nose all right let s go ahead and work over here so let s go ahead and catchup ourselves here what is one new question you have or experiment you would preform so based on what you ve already done is there something you are curious about i just gave you free reign go ahead do whatever you want do you have any questions about anything yeah e stay here yeah i ll stay here while you write it down why do they have to close it up close the test tubes up okay so would you be curious about doing the experiment without closing it that s a good question what was your question every four plants and four snails would they survive with the lights on or off what do you think i think with the lights off because if they have four plants they will have i mean if they had it on they ll produce a lot of oxygen therefore the snails would die but if you put it off maybe they ll produce the right amount of oxygen they ll produce a lot of oxygen the snails will die well it s kind of complicated no i want to try it out you re saying that you think that because it s too much oxygen too much oxygen in this one container maybe well who would benefit from all that oxygen the snails okay so we know the snails would stay alive cause they would have what oxygen okay what about the plants do you think the plants are going to stay alive nope why because they don t have carbon dioxide maybe how s the situation so far good i think it s bad probably it won t survive because so in the light it s okay it s balanced one s giving the other one s getting you got that all right so what do you think is going to happen at night they re going to die probably who s going to die the snails why do you think the snails are going to die i don t know because it s going to be too much co2 too much co2 why is there going to be too much co2 because the snails can t get o2 cause there s no light exactly go ahead and hit play whoa whoa too much co2 did that co2 what did you notice about it and the plants died there was no oxygen there was no oxygen but why did the plants die plants don t need oxygen plants need co2 there was too much they couldn t give off it already was at the max reached it s max here s my question are the snails the only ones making co2 who else is making co2 the plants do plants make co2 at night how could you design a little experiment to test that what can you do to design an experiment right now to test that take all the snails out okay and what okay let s see we want to see if plants will go through respiration at night we re looking for the co2 only what is that a rock okay so look at your data so far what do you notice they re producing a lot of oxygen i m following okay so isn t that weird i thought plants made oxygen i mean they re producing a lot of carbon dioxide they are why are they producing carbon dioxide i thought plants made oxygen wasn t it through respiration okay so they can t get sunlight so they re not going through photosynthesis photosynthesis but they are going through respiration respiration so remember our respiration right they don t have sunlight does respiration need sunlight to work no it needs energy nope it doesn t so all they need is what co2 no what does this stand for glucose right so they need glucose and oxygen was there oxygen in there before we started no there wasn t oh wait yes there was look it s even there was oxygen in there there was six cpms of oxygen so then it went through this process and it made energy which kept them alive it made co2 which you saw because the co2 levels went up up and it also made water h2o which you can t really tell it turned yellow and it s probably still inside the cells does that make sense though okay good all right how are we doing here are we almost done you guys are you getting you re understanding a little okay well let me ask you something do plants go through respiration uh yes how do you know cause they re color it change colors the plants change colors no the water to what color dark blue a dark blue like a darker blue what does dark blue represent let s go back to the beginning part what does dark blue tell you dark blue means that there s what low dark blue means that there s low what okay and you re telling me that respiration sorry that respiration plants go through respiration right uh huh so would there be a low amount of co2 if it goes through respiration no no it will be uh huh so should it be blue yes no no no no it d be yellow uh huh what kind of experiment did you do to show me that plants go through respiration tia plants go through respiration if you cut the lights on and cut the lights off and if you cut the lights on then the water turns blue because it s giving off oxygen cut the lights off they won t go through respiration because they they won t go through respiration no only photosynthesis because there will be no light for them stop give me my paper okay tamara and kelly o please stop and i have a question do you want us to do for our predictions do you want us to do why or why not for both of them or just one even if they re different maybe one of your predictions your plants lived maybe one of your predictions the plants die both of them lived then you can just why do you think both of them lived all right i have a quick question can you guys look over here for a second okay tya over here william over here okay how may of you guys i want a couple people to share their predictions what helped your when you had the three plants that died right most of you were surprised you were like wow how did three plants die with the lights on they had oxygen they had a co2 and they died right so you were surprised what was your prediction what did you set up as an experiment to help them survive what did you predict nacora give me one i put three plants and one snail okay so she said she put three plants one snail how many of you guys did three plants and one snail or a combination of plants and snails okay why did you do that why did you do a combination of plants and snails william because the snails will produce the co2 while the plants would produce the o2 okay so he said the plants would produce o2 the snails would produce co2 what s another option what if i said you know what i m gonna take all your snails good luck keeping those plants alive keyon if i take away all your snails and i said haha you have no snails to keep your plants alive should that be a problem no okay tell me why that wouldn t be a problem why would that not be a problem haley because all you have to do is put three plants in the dark okay how is that going to help you how is putting three plants in the dark she said you can just turn off the lights how would that be helpful because there s more co2 okay more co2 why is there more co2 i would say you can just put them in the light and the dark cause when they re in the light they do photosynthesis and when they re in the dark they do respiration okay she said in the dark they use photosynthesis and in the dark they do respiration isaiah wouldn t you just turn the lights off okay we just said we could turn the lights completely off here s another question do plants go through respiration yes no okay hold on if you said no why are you saying no they don t go through respiration because only animals go through respiration and plants go through photosynthesis okay brandon i want you to set up an experiment for me put one plant put one plant in your test tube and turn the lights off just one plant in the test tube and turn the lights off how many people know what s going to happen one plant in a test tube with the lights off all right look at that okay are the plants alive yes is there more oxygen then co2 no what is there more of co2 how is there more co2 in there it started at six and six why is there more co2 in there respiration because it s not doing photosynthesis because it s not going through photosynthesis but that means that our o2 shouldn t go up why is the co2 going up why is the co2 going up because in the dark the plants breath out co2 okay what is that process of them breathing out their getting rid of co2 what is that process kaleil you kept saying it over and over respiration all right respiration here s another question do plants go through respiration in the day time no photosynthesis what does respiration give you as an animal atp wait atp and i don t want to look no and oxygen no carbon dioxide so respiration gives your carbon dioxide if you look up here look elise respiration gives you carbon dioxide water and energy right do plants when they re going through photosynthesis do they make energy do you see energy in the photosynthesis equation no okay so how do they stay alive during the day do they die during the day and stay alive at night no do they stay alive during the day and die at night no how do they stay alive the whole day long they use the sun s energy they use the what the sun s energy okay and then what do they do with that glucose it just sits there cause glucose isn t energy yet they have to turn into respoiration oh so do they go through respiration during the day yes no they have to or they would die so they make their energy they make glucose but the glucose isn t energy isaiah until they break it down in respiration so do plants have to go through respiration during the day and night yes yes do you go through respiration day and night yes no you don t no do you die at night every time you go to sleep that would be creepy you reproduce every time you go at night no what no you stay alive all day long you stay alive all day long tamara plants stay alive all day long because they go through respiration this is the key respiration the key nikera to getting the glucose for respiration is in photosynthesis photosynthesis this is what keeps everything alive but to get some of the ingredients for this you need to go through this do you see why now we depend on each other ah yes okay understanding so we don t go through photosynthesis just plants do but plants go through both,1.0
think out loud what are we doing ok you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to how do we do that take 196 divide it by four hold on let me hear from somebody that i haven t heard from need to find the square root of 196 ok why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four because all sides are equal well if all sides were equal that s why we would divide by four because to find the area of the square you have to square it so the opposite of squaring is square root so we would divide by four if we were given the perimeter if we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four but we were given the area so we need to square root 14 ok so the side lengths are 14 multiply times 4 it s 56 anybody see a problem with this ok so this side is on the inside of the figure so it doesn t count so instead of doing 14 times 4 we do 14 times 3 how do we find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi r divided by 2 2 pi r divided by 2 how do you find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi r divided by 2 so the radius that means 7 7 is 14 2 times pi times 7 so that should be 2 times 3 14 so the whole thing is 53 38 so then 2 pi r divided by 2 i got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14 so 14 divided by 2 is 7 here skye can you take this thank you put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem c squared ok all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal how many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure don t you got to work it into two rectangles i think it d be easier of you did it the long way does it matter which way you split it either way you re going to have to split something right you can determine either of the missing sides in order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply 7 times 6 is 42 where is i don t see a 7 in my problem ok but what does 7 represent i don t see a 7 what is it represents the length of this what length from the line on down to 6 ok could you label that with a 7 cause i still don t see 7 it said how many one inch squares ok so you want to multiply what by 12 87 87 times 12 why but you made the 12 into a 7 ok so you want to do where are you all getting 12 from a foot is 12 inches there s one inch not twelve oh because i found the 87 feet squared i found the area of it but then you ve got to find how many 1 inch so you multiply it times 12 because there s 12 inches in a foot so what are we multiplying with 12 so we re doing 87 times 12 shouldn t you divide though try dividing what do you get when you divide say that again in one square foot there are 144 inches instead of going by 12 which i said originally shouldn t we be doing it by 144 since one square foot is how many inches it is but i ve got 87 square foot but i m saying in each foot there s 144 inches so instead of 12 there are 144 square inches so instead of multiplying by now that i think about it we should multiply it by 144 ok let me ask you guys this what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area could we do it that way yeah ok let s try it that way what would 9 be in inches 9 feet in inches 108 108 what would 5 be in inches 7 in inches 7 feet 84 84 thank you kashmir and 6 72 72 thank you sierra ok we know what all our units are in inches now when we find the area we re going to be finding square inches somebody want to take over from here skye do you mind if you continue writing uhm yeah no i don t mind thank you you can erase all of it my eraser got stolen so do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width right yeah it s what 6 480 it s multiplying but that s wrong though don t you still have to subtract i mean like 84 minus 60 because they re part of the no we didn t convert the 12 we converted the 7 oh ok so it s still already changed good question though what s the total 12 528 i just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct you are supposed to multiply by 144 good job what did you say it was 12 528 how d you get that ok next problem no you have a question yes when you get 1000 when did you have 1 044 oh and then you multiply by 12 again because guess what 12 times 12 is 144 so that s what you re doing you re multiplying by into 12 and 12 right they way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15 from the very very top to the very bottom thank you because now we know that that s 1 inch can t you break it up now that we know the basic triangle in the back that means you re breaking it up into a triangle and a square yes the square on the bottom i m sorry jacob the base of what the base of the triangle in the back but what s the base 5 the height is 5 and the base is 15 well yeah but i was asking jacob what the base of the triangle was can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18 because the width of the rectangle is 10 and i have to add the sides of the triangle,1.0
okay what s in here do me a favor go up and tell me what i m gonna need put i put down the if he s right say okay boys and girls because it is raining i need my one two three umbrella what happened to that thing i like red matches my jacket maybe because it s raining this this protects me from the rain so because it is raining i need a one two three umbrella umbrella umbrella i might put that here maybe i ll need it okay maybe i ll need it later okay boys and girls so let s keep going boys and girls since it is i ll need my you wanna try it come up come up i don t know i don t know oh so now ooh okay so nice job because it is one two three snowing i ll need my gloves what type of gloves i have these gloves are these gloves the type of gloves i need no are these gloves the type of gloves i need yes no i think i don t think these will work these gloves say it with me gloves gloves now just people in pink gloves gloves oh there s a lot of people wearing pink okay just boys gloves just girls gloves very nice just people from china gloves just people from south america gloves all right there we go there we go all right let s keep moving okay boys and girls it is so i ll need my we re right here what is this what s going on here windy so windy so windy what do i need tina come on up come on up i don t know maybe i ll use this okay so tina tina one two three guys because it is windy okay in chinese it s okay i ll need my jacket all right all right great great great great so guys i just wanna say one thing i wanna say that these words i m using are cause and effect words and we have some examples of clothing here that you re gonna need and i want you to focus for a second with this say it with me since since because because so so boys and girls these are words you use when speaking when you re talking about cause and effect when speaking because it s snowing i need my heavy jacket that s cause and effect these are words we use with speaking these words let s say them just one time for a little pronunciation practice thus thus therefore therefore consequence three syllables con se quence consequence all right good good and the fact is and the fact is these are pretty much words we re gonna use in writing only we don t really speak these words not often very rare these we used in speaking since because and so and these are the words you re gonna be using today you re gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships these are more when you re writing an essay an essay like maybe for the ela or when you re writing an academic essay okay so we have one more you guys are doing so great and i have a lot of stuff here i have a one two three scarf say it with me scarf scarf what about that f on the end scarf scarf scarf scarf okay i like this scarf it s a nice scarf i have a what is this sweater sweater or sweatshirt sweatshirt no sweater sweater sweater okay i think when it s what is this outside sunny say it with me sunny sunny it is sunny so i think you know what s interesting is this is the important word so so so i ll need sunglasses boys and girls when it gets really really sunny outside sometimes the sun hurts my eyes so i put on my sunglasses okay so i want you to try it now i want you to try it boys and girls now you all have in front of you two worksheets you have one worksheet in front of you you have two different ones many of you have this worksheet and many of you have this worksheet okay i just gonna do one quick sentence here because it is hot i ll need my sunglasses shirt someone raise their hand tina tina say that loud sunglasses sunglasses sunglasses and shorts oh i didn t tell you about my shorts i brought those today too say it with me shorts shorts say it with me shorts shorts okay so it s sunny and i m gonna need my shorts and sunglasses i got em i ll need my sunglasses and shorts and because here this is what you call a transition word this is what we re working on now if i have this here juan pablo you have this worksheet we have cause and effect if i have this here we have let s say since it is raining i ll need my raincoat and that s a coat for rain it s on your list there so what is this word here say it with me since since since is a transition word in speaking and then sometimes writing like this style of writing you would use these words all the time in speaking you show cause and effect since i don t have any money i can t buy anything to eat tonight because it s raining i think i ll go to the movies cause and effect boys and girls use it each and every time you think about speak about cause and effect now i want you to try this with your partner and then we re gonna practice speaking these out on three i want you to go three two one go use the examples use the sentences and here s some more additional examples for you do you see it up top clothing right here clothing how would you make clothes out of that can you see it give it a try can you read this to me what do you need when it s hot okay so you see the list right here which items are for hot which items are for cold can you try to write that for me i m gonna come back look at the charts they are there to help you you see the chart that i made so let s try something i want to try something can you read me actually read hon lu your first sentence and you read her your first sentence you first partner a partner b partner a go you first you re partner a because it is raining i need my umbrella and raincoat because it s hot i need my shorts okay now you re speaking to each other not to me okay keep going go since it is sunny i need my sunglasses can you write that there look right here that list for you okay you see on the look at the word slide through it two syllables is that one boot one boot or two so how is there yes yes boots great this is great stuff i m proud of you so proud of you read this you look like you haven t got started here so listen to him he did a really nice job here and let s work together okay can you read me your first sentence because it s hot so i need my sunglasses good now pause now listen i want you to try one so i need my i m sorry did you say the umbrella if it s hot i need an umbrella no if it s which one which one if i if it which one do i need an umbrella,1.0
can someone come up and put number one on the graph and then we re going to debate about it anassia can you come up and show us where you think one should be alright so what i think is i don t know if i m right or wrong or whatever but i thought kinda one is there do you guys see it no ok back can you give us a reason why ok well it says david had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant so i kinda think that from home the restaurant must be close that s why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card we don t know if he has money on him ya know it could depend on circumstances but i think that the restaurant was hella close that s why he went back and went back home ok wait wait wait wait wait wait wait ok so honestly who has that opinion so you think one is at the very beginning mmmhmmm of his trip ok can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place anassia can you pick someone overwhelming you i put it right here right there right there ok can you give us a reason he s driving and then he goes to the restaurant and then he s driving away no this is the restaurant right here and then he s leaving and he s like oh snap i left my credit card then he goes back and then he s driving away that s it ok wait so whose idea do we agree with sidius or anassia sidius ok but we still have to convince anassia because she still thinks it s at the beginning right i thought it was at the beginning too you did who convinced you myself yourself ok so if david is driving back to the restaurant then should his slope be what what should his slope be negative if he s going back to the restaurant right because if i m travelling this way my slope s getting bigger my distance is getting farther but wait i turn back so my slope has to be negative negative so do you think one is when the slope gets negative yeah so are you convinced now anasstia that it has to be negative for him to go back yeah so are we ok with erasing that first one well i have to erase all of it anyway oh ok sorry ok so one should be where he s going back right where he s going negative ok alright is there a real end to it well we re going to see once we get through them alright so sidi can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be no hands i would put two here can you explain why candy wait just give us an explanation yeah because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative he went back close to his house yeah near his house but then it s near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero because the line there represents the distance from his home right i ve got a question ok you know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house we re looking at his car not looking at the tow away car aren t we so wouldn t it be considered constant since his car is moving so i guess the car is on the tow truck right so now wherever the tow truck goes the car has to go right yeah does anyone have a different place for number two no so we all agree that two no do you want to put two in a different place put it in a different place let s see what you think put it in a different place let s see what you think go i was thinking of putting it right here that s what i was thinking that s what i thought too can you explain why why because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house so i was thinking that the first sentence so his car broke down so if he was not going anywhere then the time was going then constant so if as you see the time his speed never changes while the time is just going down that s what i think that s wrong we don t say that s wrong we say well i disagree well so convince him otherwise because the car is still moving and if you look really really closer at the graph the last point isn t directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero also if it was constant that means he would just be in one spot but it s clearly saying that he s being towed back towards the repair shop so he s in motion like the slope is showing distance and not speed well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere so can i say two things one thing so it s a different interpretation of this problem right so if he was broken down and the car was just staying there then would this be a good place for two yes if the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing it s not changing right because time is going on but distance is staying the same however number two says he s going to the repair shop close to his house so is he just staying in one place no right so he s gonna go back home so if he s going back home so this slope would be negative or positive negative negative and it s going here s home right so where does he go back home or very close to home here right are you convinced danny yes ok let s erase the other number two but danny thank you for being brave because i could understand that interpretation alright danny can you pick someone to put number three on the graph ok number three is over here i disagree wait wait we haven t even heard her explanation wendy what s your explanation why because it s stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it s kinda constant here so it can be stopped so why not the long one because he s in the restaurant i suppose but then so if one is here if one is here it has to be in the restaurant then right well then one is over there so then why would three be all the way over there one is here right no no no one is all the way at the beginning no sorry that s y but then it says that he got a three yes but it s here yeah he ate there so wouldn t that be the one like wouldn t that be where he gets his gas number three said that he went to eat but it doesn t say where did he eat maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about yeah maybe he went a bit farther and said ok let me go somewhere else so that s why so what did he do here eat and gas it doesn t take that long to eat one hour people take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can t just eat while they re getting gas oh let me eat while i m getting gas ok so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station the restaurant the restaurant so do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time short shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is right so we haven t gotten to the restaurant yet have we no no ok so could three be the place where he stops and gets gas could it be possibly we don t know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour or maybe it meant five minutes yeah you know you never know so if we interpreted five minutes gas and quick bite quick sandwich could we put three at that place yes why because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time i think that at three he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card maybe the gas station is near the restaurant why you make this so difficult that s possible though right i m like thinking of putting at the beginning here here is four wait wait wait don t go on four yet but i think the three should be before one because you can t just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich ok we re going to do this because i like the debate you re having but i want groups to think about it individually and then we re going to come back but i want to put one thing for sure on the board ok so if if if if if if this is definitely let s say this is definitely where david stopped to eat ok so this is where david is eating eating as in in the restaurant eating at the restaurant yes so here david is eating for a long time at the restaurant ok a long long time so that s the longest is this the longest time where the slope is flat yeah so we re all gonna agree right now that this is where david is eating at the restaurant so this is where david is eating at the restaurant can you put all the other numbers in a logical place because i hear you guys talking about logic like he can t go to the gas station before he does what goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card ok so i see that s one logical statement so in your groups i m gonna give you five minutes for this can you put one two three and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it ok,1.0
who s done writing okay alright ok couple of goals for this piece today here s where we re at here one clearly get the notes and rhythms down because this comstock piece ok and so is the second middleston piece three the primo so we ll do both those today wanna get the notes learned the notes and rhythms learned but i also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece just like if we were getting ready for contest in march do one of those little example pieces for sight singing so we ll treat this in the same manner as that then i wanted to also as we re reading the piece take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it you ll see some things here in a minute alright so if we take a look at the piece and we ve already written solf ge in we take a look at the piece what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different repeats okay even before that like right up by the title canon canon what s that mean the canon okay what s a canon it s a round it s a round right so you have one set of music and then the same set of music follows it later right we do that in warm ups okay alright so a canon so you think soprano and alto are in canon it d probably be women and men probably women and men good good observation so we look at the structure where might that canon begin after a p at the bottom of the page okay so pick up to measure 11 alright okay so what kind of material do the guys have there it says we mix with the women s structure exactly that same material that the girls do so in our rehearsal noting that this is a canon at least to that point how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away girls and guys sing their parts together girls and guys sing their parts together good easy so if we do that then what might something else be helpful for us to do we re singing parts together maybe pair up typically we get together and we chant so let s do that first let s do the chanting just like we do for sight singing so you can practice that okay so what are our pairs gonna be soprano and tenor so you have to move and bass and alto so starting at solf ge girls you start at the beginning guys you simply start at measure pick up at measure 11 okay go on and move yes circle up right here alright who s gonna be our leader who wants to start us off alena alena okay you can start us off who s going to start the you okay there you go okay good go for it chant it quickly let s start at the beginning we are on the pick up to 4 so 1 2 3 and 4 so so mi fa so do re mi okay so now we got to the end of that go to measure 11 for the girls and measure 21 for the guys go right there and start it again so now girls you go measure 11 which is right where you finished and guys go to 21 same thing here that s a little bit different alright 1 and 2 let s all chant together in rhythm stay in your groups stay in your groups please but we re gonna start with the sopranos and altos and then we ll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page so start at the beginning everybody 1 2 and ready and go stop okay now guys you re gonna pick up there and girls you re gonna come in 2 beats later here we go ready and go okay go right on the coda please so we would ve done the repeat now we go back here go right on the coda please right after the double bar ready and go 3 4 fermata cut off please sopranos ready and go bass okay pretty good we ll come back to that that takes a little bit of fordating when you get together okay go back to sections let s do right in the not your traditional sections let s keep the basses over here altos over here tenors and sopranos over here so do two rows back in your sections okay so we re gonna do just like we chanted we re gonna partner up and we re gonna sing it at the same time okay at the same time so guys you re starting in measure 11 girls you re starting in measure pick up to 1 ready and do do do do do sing that first note please sopranos and altos and okay tenors and basses okay let s sing all at the same time right where your canon first name of the canon is here we go 1 2 and ready and sing okay sopranos sorry altos and basses here we go doo doo that s a mi here we go start that again 1 and beginning and go okay go back to the do do mi so la fa do la fa sing that ready on the do 1 2 do that again same spot 1 2 okay good excellent reading good for you now putting it together canon lots of people think oh canons are easy no problem it s the same thing except canons tend to be tricky we ll see how it goes here we go soprano and alto first do mi so mi do sing your first notes girls ready and here we go 1 2 and ready and go okay good i was gonna stop you before then but you did so well so we kept singing good for you okay so what happens at 21 for the girls well not sorry measure 11 for the girls does what something different so what would we call it b or the counter melody of this okay so it s kind of the same shape but it starts on what pitch class instead of do no sorry what did we first start at the beginning so and mi and this starts on do so different pitch class same shape but it s singing the fifth lower okay for soprano okay good let me hear the guys please you did really well until we got to the b section let me hear actually let s hear everybody do the b section so guys you re gonna start at 21 girls you re gonna start at 11 basses it s just no it s not it s not different at all do here is do find your first pitch,1.0

for students in the front of the room we often sit right in the center of the room there s also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in my tables are shaped around there in a u shaped formation each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling indicating the table there s a red table orange yellow green blue and so forth each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables in the very back corner is the teacher desk two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that s hooked up to the digital whiteboard across the back of the room i have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work and store some ongoing large artworks on the back wall i have more storage metal cabinets rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from and directly below me is our class pet this is where shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating like rabbits and dogs dinosaurs and kitty cats and puppies so first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures listen so that we have time for working i need everyone to put in bubble we are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long long long ago the very oldest art in the whole world are horses and bulls inside of a cave so the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals about horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them put hands down put hands down dinosaurs yeah well that was after the dinosaurs but i m looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here does anyone recognize some of those animals yeah izaiah do you izaiah izaiah with a z do you want to go up and point come up and show us some animals that you recognize only animals who only only listen she s the teacher right now what s it kangaroo what else let her answer fish and turtle and um crocodile and a duck yeah and some kind of a bird good job did you notice that these are all made with dots that s how some artists who live in australia kimberly come right here in front of me turn around so you can see that s how some artists in australia make animals and they kind of show what s inside of them don t they it s really good that you notice that izaiah do you have a comment i know all those animals good so you were naming them right along with her raiden why is your name up your hand up you said last time we have to finish our oh we do have to finish those you re right we will don t worry okay next what kind of animal is that a horse a horse you know what it says at the top it s a horse of a different color because what color is it blue kind of like the wizard of oz right there why boys and girls why is the horse blue what do you think why is the horse blue to make the horse beautiful to make it beautiful why else would it be blue maybe because it there s another one it s a unicorn horse isn t it what shhhh what i m curious izaiah why would an artist make a horse blue because it might be a unicorn well it could be why because it might be a different kind of animal yeah it might be a different type of animal horse have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination and used your favorite colors in it how many people do that sometimes i know i do sometimes i might make an animal but instead of making him brown maybe i ll make him pink and purple and yellow ooooooh and make him a little bit more imaginative sometimes at my dad s house all by myself what else do we have another horse here s a fancy prancy horse now the other horse was kind of looking down but what s this horse doing what s this horse doing jumping flying he s walking or galloping isn t he he looks look how he s standing look at the two horses if you had to tell me how this horse is feeling sad why do we think sad emma why do you think sad because he s looking down he is looking down isn t he maybe he s sad because his family just got killed by another animal oh i hope that didn t happen he could be sad about something that happened what about this horse happy why melanie why do you think he looks happy because he still has a family of his own because why because he still has a family of his own that s not why that s not why izaiah you might have a different idea than melanie isn t it okay to have a different idea yeah so i need you sitting kimberly and regan you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun izaiah so it s okay to have what was your idea about why he might be happy because he s walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals oh my but that wouldn t be very happy would it you think he looks happy are there any other words you can think of to describe him he s prancing around usually if you re in a bad mood do you walk around like this with your head up no i used to do this too that s not prancing that s stomping but prancing is when you have your head up isn t it kimberly kimberly right here come over here by me maybe maybe he was doing this because on his arm there s something on his arm oh it could be like a bandage couldn t it it might just be the way it s painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him is that what you re noticing what are you noticing but one of my family died awww that is sad isn t it really really really old that happens sometimes i m sorry family died in a fire guess what guess what shhhh kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom not crawling on the floor you have to color inside of it you might want to draw his shell first to make it really big look at mine can i see good job make these lines really really dark hey look at my turtle go back over it like this boys and girls if your paper s kind of cause you re pushing so hard then you re drawing dark enough okay they should really be pressing hard with that good go over it really really dark that s dark enough it looks great oh kimberly yes and put your name on the front with the crayon well look izaiah here s two choices for your shell you can start with an oval like that or you can start like this okay yeah but i think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle which one do you like make it really big perfect there you go look at my turtle boys and girls i want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint okay keep darkening your lines okay darken those lines we have to go and get our paint boys and girls darken every line and i m going to come around and as soon as i see that yours is nice and dark i ll put the paint on your table okay this is yours that s good that s good this is dark enough what i want you to trace over is the black parts and see these pencil lines you have to trace over top of them or the paint will cover them up so what color would you like to use there what color would you like to trace these in come pick a color come sit down tyler start working on your design no start working on your designs in the middle that s perfect nice and dark boys and girls see how dark these lines are this is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be you want to go back over it and trace it really dark that one looks good too nice and dark that s awesome start drawing i need yellow boys and girls would you put your name on pardon the interruption please come to the office please come to the office put your name right here while you re getting ready to paint put your name on the front in crayon nice and dark write your name nice and dark with your crayon well trace over it with the crayon look at mine as soon as you re sitting down caitlin i m coming around to look boys and girls when you re ready you may put your hand up and i ll come around and check your pictures you are ready yours looks really nice good he made me draw it for you very good melody i m waiting for that hand to go up isaiah ah that looks great while you re waiting for your paint make those darker shhhh darken these a little bit izaiah what are you doing oh i like your turtle,1.0
yeah why don t we list that up here okay here is what you re going to do go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick put those pencils away in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and just to make sure you haven t now you have identified you have taken this work of art you ve seen what it is and you ve taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used now we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements what kind of thought feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements with this subject so who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found what s one shapes shapes what s another one color color shape lines value value texture you guys with those elements they re telling you something so here s what we re going to we re going to put on our thinking pairing and sharing hats so whatever i do that so you guys can pair and share together will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference thank you all right first question ready the first question is how does this man feel now think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel no talking think to yourself think shh you ve got to tell me why too don t just think about feeling tell me why two people look like they re pairing already don t pair yet now tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking is feeling is feeling all right now we re ready to share with the whole group so i m going to start with right here with jermaine s group and we re going to go around and each person is going to get a turn or each pair is going to get a turn so first what was your group thinking how did he feel sad why because the color blue is a sad color and he looked down so he had two reasons he had the body position because he s kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten good job he said that sad and the color blue go together what do you guys think how does he feel i think he feels happy he s smiling and he s playing the guitar okay because he s creating music maybe that s what makes him happy i heard miss webster had a disagreement when they were pairing miss webster what is your take what do you think he s feeling tell me what you think he is sit up tell me what you think he is i think he s sad because okay because why he looks what say it again honey don t be embarrassed it s okay to have a different opinion i think he is lonely because he doesn t have any friends there s nobody else in that picture he is by himself in the picture maybe he s lonely we don t know okay so we had a difference of opinion that s okay next pair i think he s sad because he s looking down if he was happy he d be whoa wait a minute she just said this man doesn t have anything to eat why do you think he doesn t have any because his shirt is torn he don t have no pants and he don t have no socks so you re telling me he looks what is he rich or is he poor no he s poor okay that is very good insight on not only the details but also just what those details are telling us okay do you have something else to add what would you say i said i think he was happy to sit alone i think he s happy because he just okay so you think the guitar looks even though his clothing looks torn his guitar looks nice right maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes maybe not last pair tell me what you think he s feeling i think he s one at a time i think he s it looks like he s playing a sad song he s playing a sad song and he s playing why do you think it looks like he s playing a sad song because he s bowing his head down and his face don t look very happy okay you guys next question i can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat did you have something different than that okay go ahead i think he s sad because he looks like he s homeless oh maybe he s homeless now why do you think he s homeless because his shirt s torn on the side are there any other clues besides his clothing we already had miss marshall tell us about his clothing what other clues do we have that makes us think he s homeless without talking and making noise jermaine do you have a clue why he might be homeless why because he s outside by his self he looks like me might be outside this might be a step that he s sitting on next question next question what do you think the artist is trying to tell us what is the important message put your hands down think what is the message why is the artist painting this picture of this man i have one person she s got herself in the thinking posture she s thinking think please think think think i ve got a good thinker at this table i hope you re thinking honey okay now pair up ready pair and share with your table mate get paired up thirty more seconds to share i hear some good talking so i m giving you 30 more seconds why don t you share this time because you shared last time okay so you re going to share this time let s see you sitting up nice and tall we re going to share with the entire group we all learn from each other you guys we re going to start with the opposite way i m going to go this way can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us by painting this picture i m sorry just a second could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve you guys when you re listening to what he s saying he s trying to tell you what he thinks what his table mate thinks so you need to turn your body make eye contact and really listen to what he s saying okay okay go again i think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he s homeless he doesn t have any money he doesn t have any value okay when you mean value do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean like he seems very sad okay so you re talking about the color right okay next group i think that the artist is trying to persuade him wait a minute say that word again he s trying to what persuade persuade us what persuade us to think what persuade us he feels real mad or trying to do music or something okay is that what your team came up with you came up with something different than your team you had a disagreement right i think that i was not do you think the artist wants you to be like him no what do you think the artist wants you to learn from him he won t have nothing to work you can have a better life right okay this group could you put your feet down it s your turn you re going to share with us what your team came up with you can share come on you can talk to us remember that there s no wrong answer it s just what you think,1.0

three two one stop okay were there pairs of you who chose different things um hmm and who wants to share i said if i had to pick i would pick the green cylinder because the white would overflow easy the pink you would have to reach down far to get it okay devon i would pick the pink one because it s like thin enough to be like a cup and you can do this with it and it would be a lot easier than just like doing this especially because if it gets on the bottom of the green one it would be hard to get it and the white one it might spill if you walk around with it or you could trip okay good layla but well i agreed with devon on the pink one but i would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn but it also is harder to hold unless you were to like since it has more area the white one has more area than the pink or the green one more area you re talking this way yeah okay so you re saying you take the popcorn and you could like you could make it even on the bottom of it so it wouldn t necessarily be overflowing unless you were when you walk for the popcorn thing okay all right brittany me and lani had the same answer we would think that it sort of relates to what devon said if we picked the green one because and related to the pink one s gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn and the green one is wide enough and it can hold it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one but it s still gonna be hard to get down the pink one and the white one s just gonna spill okay all right tiffany we thought that the green and pink one it doesn t matter because they re probably gonna hold the same capacity since they re the same shape it s just one s taller and one s shorter but the short one s wider and the tall one s skinnier it s tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same so you said either one of these two it didn t matter okay kylie i would want the green cup because it s easier like to get your hand down it the pink one looks like really skinny so if you have big hands it would be hard to get your hand down it okay all right amani i think the green one becuase when you look at it the old popcorn container and the green one they re kinda the same although the green one is a little bit bigger so then you could get more okay i said the green one also because the pink one is skinny and it if went to the same size as that with the same amount of popcorn it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one do you know what i m saying say that again okay i picked the green one because say you fill them with popcorn and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one and you put it in the green one it s gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one and the white one it s just gonna fall over cause it s too small it s too flat okay hold on josh now tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount did you say that mm hmm and why did you say that because they re the same size paper except one they re just folded different okay she said that because they re the same size paper they re folded differently but she thinks that they re gonna hold the same amount and you are disagreeing mm hmm okay she s disagreeing saying that the green one s going to hold more is that correct what you said i said yeah the green one would hold more okay josh what do you think i said i would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out and because it might have more volume than those two yeah okay so let s change our thinking here some of you did think about which one is going to hold more it didn t matter whether your hand could get easier into this one or devon liked this one cause he could tilt it up he didn t even have to have his hand in it at all which is an interesting way to look at it a lot of you said you didn t like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot yes ma am but unless you did what i suggested and you like evened it out on the bottom yes because you said you liked this one cause you thought it held more than the other two but you d have to like flat not necessarily like squish the popcorn so it s flat you d have to like shake things sideways so that it would even it out like food in a pan you would shake it to even it out on the bottom okay all right well it s kinda like with the little kid packs there are things shaped like that and it has like gummies and popcorn in it and i don t like it cause like everyone would get the other ones it would have like more popcorn in it okay tiffany what i would suggest the white one is like even it s the same shape as the other two pieces of paper but it s folded so it s taking less up space but it s folded because it overlaps here it does overlap here with the white you re right there but i disagree with molly because the popcorn amount that s inside of the inside the square ones at newtown is the same amount as one of the plastic ones the exact same amount of popcorn cause they actually use those as measuring cups i ve watched them do it and i ve watched them actually use those cups those hard ones to fill the other cup to fill the other ones so you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this all of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones as measuring cups all right devon i agree with layla like they re all the same i think it just depends on like who you are kind of like which one you want okay but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one yeah so if you could choose that would be a good thing right hold on a second let s move on a second and i m gonna have mk come up here and help me we re gonna see if they hold the same okay i want you however on your paper to write down you know which one you think holds the most do they hold the same or if you think they hold a different amount put em in order like which one is least middle greatest why don t you do that real quick why don t you put em in order which one do you think okay this is what she thinks she thinks least middle greatest here s what we re going to do i do not have popcorn but i do have cereal and hopefully hopefully mk can pour this hopefully okay so you re i m gonna hold it or would you rather hold it and me pour wait yeah you might wanna pour it okay and just make sure that the bottom stays okay we are smellin the sugar up here yeah okay can you all see that it s at the top yeah all right now what we are going to do so this is this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls we re gonna put this over top and you re gonna lift it up and see what happens and some of you have predicted that it s going to be the same right how many have predicted that they re all the same all the same okay how many are predicting that the green is bigger predicting that the green is bigger okay what about the white is biggest anybody predict the white is biggest okay why don t you lift this up i ll hold this this time you gotta make sure that pink s bigger ooh can you see can you see so there s more room right there s more room in the green one why because the more space it has the bigger around it is the more cereal that could fit in it so what is that called around here circumference well this is circumference but at the bottom volume it is volume cause we re measuring volume but what is at the bottom of this base a base is that what you re saying that the base it depends on how big the base is well let s look to see whether it ll fit in here okay there it is exact same room as the pink well do you think there s the exact same room as the pink no i think the white has more you think the white could fit more yeah okay thank you mk have a seat but what do we know about this one now it s the smallest it s the smallest do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here and figure out what the formula or the volume is like the length of it the length of the pink one does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures eight by is it eight by 12 eight by 12 eight by six eight by 10 eight by 10 eight by 10 a foot a foot eight by 11 okay it is actually eight and a half by 11 okay eight and a half by 11 so our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11 okay so for our pink one what is when we do this what is this the circumference its the circumference what do we know about the circumference then for the pink one that it s 8 5 it is 8 5 so circumference equals what 8 5 the circumference equals 8 5 are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference yes no you say yes yeah i know what you could do you could divide it by 3 14 cause that s how you get cause you know how it s the opposite of times so that you would do it and you would divide that by 8 4 no 3 14 and then you ll have the diameter and then you can just take half of that and that d be the radius okay all right tell me brittany what is the formula for circumference pi times d circumference equals pi times d i m gonna ask someone to restate what kiki said does anyone agree with kiki yes i do and what did she say she said that you can divide the circumference by 3 14 okay so we know the circumference is 8 5 correct and we know that pi is what molly 3 14 3 14 and we re trying to find the the what devon diameter the diameter okay so both kiki and maya say you divide by 3 14 is that what we do treyshawn yes so if i divide this side by 3 14 and i divide this side by 3 14 what happens to this right here india it would get smaller it gets smaller yes if you divide it okay what is 3 14 divided by 3 14 one sure,1.0
so just leave your clicker on your table guys i mean you can put one in front of you just don t turn it on yet they re not activated please don t play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day thank you for the help excellent thanks all right guys so let s get started with our discussion here set the clicker down please don t play with it just leave it on the table thank you i asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question danny devito is between 4 9 and 5 1 tall so i m 5 10 so danny devito is either between this tall or about this tall we re not sure on his height his wife rhea perlman is 5 0 tall how tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why all right so please raise your hand to share your answer and i m going to ask you why you think like you do so i m going to start back there with alex so turn this way so that i can hear you okay okay i think their kids would be around 5 because their mom is 5 tall and their dad his middle height is 5 okay so you re looking at the middle estimated height of danny devito and his wife s height is 5 so you think together then all their children will be 5 boys and girls mm hm okay great thank you what else do you think j r i said 5 too i said 5 as well because that s about how tall they are so their kid would be around that okay so you re looking at kind of his average height and her height so you think the kids will be around that okay anything different or you want to explain it further michael i just said that you get your height from your parents so whatever the parents were right around 5 the kids will be about 5 okay you get your height from your parents so since the parents are about 5 the kids will be 5 boys and girls yeah okay great what do you think well i think the daughter could be 4 9 and the sons would be around 5 2 because both of the parents are shorter and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents okay so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents and you said that the daughters could be about 4 9 and the sons might be about 5 2 yes is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls it s just kind of a normal thing normally boys are taller than girls okay so a normal thing boys are usually taller than girls okay great any other ideas on the height of their children adam what do you think well what do you think about i think that they ll be around i think boys and girls will both be around 5 because it s right inbetween the parents okay good what about me and my family i m 5 10 so i m tall what do you think about my family members how tall do you think they are i m 5 10 how tall do you think my mom is how tall do you think my dad is what s your estimation what do you think raise your hands everybody let s participate mackenzie what do you think i think your dad would be around 6 2 and i think your mom would be around 5 11 or 5 9 okay so my mom is between 5 9 and 5 11 so close to my height and my dad would be taller about 6 2 brian what do you think i said that i think your dad would be taller than you but then your mom would be around the same height so my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller yeah anybody think anything pardon me or like around 6 my dad would be around 6 yeah what if i tell you my little brother my little baby brother is 6 4 and he is this is true he is 6 4 so he s a tall guy does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents you guys are nodding yes what do you think now travis maybe your dad is like 6 4 and your mom is like 5 8 or 5 9 or something okay so mom is about here dad is taller or 6 4 like my little brother michael what do you think both of them are about 6 both of them are about 6 okay great what do you think well i know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad from dads so that your dad is taller around 6 5 and then your mom is shorter like 5 8 so you see my height and my mom is about 5 8 and my dad is 6 5 so for my brother and i you re figuring about our traits what do you mean that you get your traits from your dad so my dad s genes are coming through why do you think that why do you think i have only traits from my dad because i know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom so more traits from dad than from mom do you think that s pretty much general yeah okay great do you guys have anything to comment on that what do you think i think your dad s probably like 6 2 because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they re still in high school oh interesting well i ll tell you my mom was 5 11 at her tallest now she s shrinking she s like 5 9 you know how that happens as you get older and my dad he s only 6 tall so my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother he s 6 1 so height does come from both sides but my dad s not as tall you guy s might ve thought let s talk about danny devito again here he is our favorite actor right notice his lack of hair he s bald the question on here says danny devito is bald what do you think his son s hair or lack of will look like when he s older and why his son danny devitto has a son what do you think about his hair nice and loud so i can hear you matthew it said that their son would have bald hair on the top but some on the sides some will be bald on the top but he ll have some hair around the sides why do you think that because usually if somebody s dad s bald they re not always bald if somebody s dad is bald they are not always bald i ve seen that you ve seen that that s a good observation matt what do you think well the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald so i thought he will still have a lot more hair than his dad he wouldn t be completely bald but bald on top okay so mom has a lot of hair dad s bald so you think the son will have hair but just bald on top yeah so when you see the traits being passed down how do you see it i m not really sure what you mean by that question you re kind of saying that he ll have this trait but he ll also have this trait so how do you see that happening did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another the son or do you think i think they were combined they were combined the traits are combined good sean i thought he would have like a blackish brown hair because that s what the mom s hair color is okay he probably wouldn t be bald but he d have a receding hairline okay so he would have a receding hairline and for those of us that don t know what that means that means when a person starts to lose their hair and it kind of inches back and they re losing their hair that s what a receding hairline is so the hair falls out as it moves back are you ready to see what danny devito s kids look like here they are for our predictions we have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family he s about 5 5 so he s taller than both mom and dad this is danny devito s wife danny devito and his son here s his daughters this daughter is about the height of the mom but she has big shoes on the other daughter is taller but notice their hair what do you notice about their hair ryan tell me what you notice about all three kids well they all have hair they re not bald they all have hair they re not bald how would you describe their hair curly curly hair what color black black or dark brown yes very good all right so we see that now when we think about these bunnies another question i asked you is this look at the picture if they had ten offspring what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like the fur in what respect that was the question nathan what do you think 25 would be white 25 would be black the remainder would be gray with a little white so part of them will be black and part of them will be white so half of them will be gray okay so here s what we have i m going to use abbreviations and 50 will be gray nathan says that because one parent is white one s black they ll combine to form a gray color just like mixing paint in art class any other predictions what else are you thinking let s hear from somebody new what else do you think omar i think 40 of the bunnies are going to be black are going to be half black and half white like a black bunny with white dots or a white bunny with black dots all right so you re saying 40 black 40 white you will see both colors we ll see black and we ll see white why did you choose 40 40 and 20 because i think that it s rare for bunnies to have dots it might be rare for them to have dots okay so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely the probability is higher for a solid color so that s why you chose 20 great great thinking great explanation sean what do you think i had 20 white and the rest are gray i would have said 25 but you can t have two and a half babies being white okay all right so you would ve said 25 so you were thinking similarly yeah why do you say 20 20 and 60 because most of them would be a mixture of the two but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit s traits okay so because they have offspring the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits so mom and dad will blend together to create gray but some of them will look just like the father some will look just like the mother so some will be black some will be white great one more idea kasey what do you think i know in health that everyone has a dominant feature i think white is so that the majority so like 40 would be white and 20 would be black and then the rest would be gray 40 white 20 black and 20 gray and you said because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe that s only 80 oh what did you say for the last one i said the rest wow well thanks for paying attention good check there guys it would be 40 60 we need 40 did you say 40 i said the rest i was just making up too many different numbers well i m so happy that you guys are paying attention i m going to tell your math teacher good job okay 40 white but here s what kasey said that was really good she said that 40 will be white because white is dominant you used that word you talked about that in health a little bit so let s talk about dominant and what that means what does it mean what do you think dominant means and be nice and loud for us john most of most of good what do you think sam main main sean the majority the majority alex beat out all others beat out all others nice what do you think sean strongest okay let me show you a little example here so where do we get our traits first of all where do we get traits from parents from where parents your parents okay it s passed down traits are passed down and some come from each parent right dominant recessive some come from both mom and dad if you received a dominant trait see i labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait so half and half mom and dad they come together which trait do you see the dominant one or the recessive one the dominant one the dominant one what if i put it this way which trait do you see the dominant one what if i put two recessive traits together the recessive the recessive okay either way i pair them mom or dad dad or mom if i have two dominant traits that go together what do i see dominant dominant okay so if the dominant trait is present then finish the sentence if the dominant trait is present in your genes then what it will show it will show kasey says that s right if the dominant trait is present it will show are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro okay let s check this then real quick yesterday you filled out this concept map let s make sure that your answers are correct jsut take a look so read this with me genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits from parent to offspring and if the offspring has the same alleles we call that purebred and if they have different alleles hybrid what that means allele that word say that allele allele it s the fun word to say during our genetics unit that s the form of the gene so is it a dominant or is it a recessive okay so let s go back here genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits i don t hear everybody controlled by genes made of alleles say it again alleles alleles so genes made of alleles shows when present we call that dominant and can be masked recessive recessive all right very good any questions on the concept map any corrections if you need to make them please do so all right well let s get going with our lab are you guys ready okay please take out your lab paper we re going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on notice the top of the paper it says problem this is what we re trying to solve this is the point of our scientific investigation are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles i d like you on the lines to create your own hypothesis or your prediction for this are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common that s the question are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles so write down what you think write down your prediction if you can write it in the if then format of how we do hypotheses that s preferred but if that confuses you at this point just write what you think is going to happen are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles whatever you think it s your thinking we will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment so once you ve written down your hypothesis reread it and make sure that it answers the question then we re going to get to work using our clickers which i ll explain in just a moment i d like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin the question again are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles please share your prediction your hypothesis ronnie i said yes because dominant alleles it shows over recessive alleles so you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles okay great girls one of you share your hypothesis for me who would like to share everyones looking at you kate what do you have on your paper i said that i thought the dominant alleles were more common you believe the dominant alleles will be more common okay great thank you another one alex i agreed with it i said that i believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive because there s more combinations to get dominant one s over recessive you believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive because there s more combinations to get that to get to that to get the dominant traits to show good one more matthew i said that the dominant traits are less common because in the picture with danny devito his son and daughters didn t look much like him okay so you believe that the dominant traits are less common because in the example of danny devito his kids didn t look much like him yeah and how your younger brother is 6 4 and how my younger brother is 6 4 but he s taller than the rest of my family okay so you re making connections to our earlier conversation good we re going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab,1.0
a prediction on the weather temperatures okay so maybe they can predict something that s going to happen yes okay so based on the information that you collected is there any information let s say you could go out the next day what do you think based on what you saw what do you think might happen the next day it might go back down into the 30s or the 20s okay and what makes you say that because there s more 30s and 20s then there are 50s and 40s and then there was a large spike so okay so it got warmer but you re saying because most of them were cooler it might get cooler again yes okay so you re making a conclusion you re using your data to support that shaun what are you thinking i was thinking that maybe they might want to track it because maybe weather can not evolve over time but how much it s changing and predict what s gonna happen okay so you re thinking like a meteorologist or a scientist might make a forecast make a prediction so you re thinking sort of like hava and were your temperatures similar to her or were they very different because you might have been at two different stations what do you think might happen on the next day i think it will drop down to the 30s because i see that it s dropping down it s going up and then it s dropping down i think it s gonna go up and then drop down again okay and it does look like you had kind of a trend here so what do you think if you had a day that went down do you think it might go up again mhm might peak up again okay is there anybody else who s looking at their data thinking of what else might happen with that temperature change madison are you looking at something yeah what do you think well with the wind speed and it would be like 8 5 for quite a few times a day sort of shot up into so what do you think that was indicating that it was a very windy day a very windy day okay so you guys some of you look at your charts if you were madison was in group a and can you make a connection or h madison can you make a connection to your wind speed really spiked on that same day did you have any difference or did you have something happen in your temperature well the temperature was about 20 degrees and because of the wind was making it cooler okay so you re saying that you think that the wind also has an effect on the temperature mhm okay so was there anybody else in group h that recorded that sort of thing you had a big windy gust you had a very windy day your temperatures went down did you have a similar thing happen to you hava yes yes okay so you guys why would we want to track something like not only temperature but also the wind speed jada so that they can know what tomorrow s gonna be like or what another day s gonna be like or for them to know if it s gonna rain or okay what the temperature is gonna do so they want to think maybe more you guys now your thinking jada you re even putting together precipitation so maybe there s a consequence of precipitation no with low temperature and maybe heat can evaporate some water and then the next day it can get dropped down and get colder okay so maybe a connection with the precipitation temperature those sorts of things okay katie o what are you thinking i would think that they wouldn t just want to track the temperature but they d also do the wind speed because wind speed can change how what the temperature is and how it changes so why do you think wind speed makes a difference with temperature what are you making the connection with what s your evidence well wind speed i think would change like it wouldn t make it warmer it would make the temperature feel colder okay so why do you think that because the wind well you go out to the playground a lot right yeah and when you guys are on the playground and it s really windy is it warm no okay so maybe are you thinking like when you go out there and it s really windy and you don t have a coat does it feel cooler to you yes does it on sometimes yeah alright so maybe they re maybe a prediction and so you were saying they so are you thinking scientists and meteorologists are trying to put those two together those phenomenons yeah okay so katie o let me ask you if this was a hypothesis that you were saying if it s windier then it may be cooler you guys agree as a class okay thumps up thumbs down what do you guys think yes no maybe a little bit there alright josh what are you thinking i was saying that if people are always looking at the temperature so we know what s gonna happen when it s gonna happen what we can expect what we need to do okay so we re taking that forecast even further maybe so let me kind of pose another question real quick before i keep going you guys let me ask you you guys remember when you went on the computer and you watched the hurricanes and you tracked the hurricanes so was that data indicating the speed or the movement of the hurricane yes yes so does a meteorologist even track something like that to be able to maybe help people yes okay so do you guys remember when the meteorologist came to visit us you guys remember that and he really talked to us a lot about tornadoes didn t he but he was also giving us situations of how we know a tornado might be forming right so yeah does that make sense that that might be another reason that they start tracking so think and talk to your shoulder partner besides a hurricane what else might they track to like josh was saying to prepare us for to let us know so talk to your shoulder partner the weather because some people can know what to like my hands yeah or like tornadoes yeah or maybe even thunderstorms or the normal weather very intense temperatures we can already know maybe even like snow because that can be a really heavy and or kind of get everywhere like snowbound us or it could like be rain snow hail so what do you think emily what else can we determine snow storm or a tornado or a earthquake so what were you thinking first alexis and then we ll come back to nick i was thinking either a tornado or blizzard snowstorm okay so what kind of weather do you think they re tracking in order for us to be prepared about weather what do we wind wind maybe and temperature snow okay so if we re looking for just a tornado maybe temperature maybe the wind yeah what kind of wind is it is it cold or hot yeah okay hot and cold fronts and then we were thinking about what else nick i would say a flood because maybe maybe the clouds are coming and there s going to be a bunch of rain like you said that we could get a flash flood okay so and are you making that connection to maybe our area that had a fire and so we have to think about would there be because it can t absorb the moisture okay so that s another idea so how would meteorologist or scientists how would they austin how would they predict maybe a flood happening what do you think they d use what kind of information would they be looking at well if a rainstorm was coming because that rain would cause a flood okay so a large amount of rain that would make sense yes or snow or even if we had a lot of snow so if we had large amounts of snow what could we possibly be warning people of if that was the case alexis what do you think stay inside or wear warm clothes if you go somewhere or something so they don t get so cold okay so would you guys say would one of you formulate some sort of a hypothesis about snow coming if there was if there was enough cold air and some times when it s raining it starts to hail and then it starts to sometimes it starts to snow so if there s cold weather and clouds then we might have consequences snow or rain or yeah of hail or heavy snow yeah okay so we d wanna keep that in mind and does that seem to happen in our areas sometimes sometimes and sometimes when we make that forecast and then maybe it doesn t come that happened on saturday okay so if it does come what happened on saturday austin i think it was really humid out at first mhm and then it started to rain and then a lot of times usually rain starts out as ice and then it melts and it started to get colder and then it started to hail so then we have the consequences of a hailstorm didn t last saturday did it start out really nice first yeah yeah and then also happened yesterday too because when i got picked up it was nice and warm and everything and then when i got to my house it was all windy and then it started raining so i was like i thought it was supposed to be hot today right so is it possible to use forecasting information and still be wrong yes well in the weather book it explains the rating of tornadoes so i m thinking tornadoes or something to track like the wind speed if it s gets too crazy it get like wind miles per hour and how bad it is like if the wind speed s really high then it can cause a tornado like the scale so they use that information we were just talking and showing the things that they might be using for information that they re collecting to do what now to give to the what they re doing it to give us warnings they can t tell us that a tornado s happening prior to it right so they have to warn us about them and so i think they collect the data from that to do that okay and then reagan what were you connecting that with i was connecting it with a blizzard or snow storm because if there s a delay and you need to go somewhere you can know that there might be delays and if you re gonna go outside you need to wear a coat a heavy coat okay so how do we respond how do we react to it good okay you guys i was going around and i heard some excellent conversations and so i think you guys made strong connections with your data and probably with your meteorologist visit what they were telling you and how you were putting that information together so i want you guys to go ahead and pick up your pencils and write underneath your graphs i want you to answer this question what does your data tell you so write there on underneath your graph or write on your graph you could even write right in the middle of your graph i want you to write what is your graph actually telling you so is it telling you that you had a series of cold days make your prediction so go ahead and take a minute or two write down what your data tells you and then what changes did you observe what was the most significant change that you observed if at all possible while you re writing that you can come up with a hypothesis about your data it could either be your wind speed or it could be your temperature write down what it is that actually took place yeah you want to answer the question what does your data tell you what changes did you observe on either graph or you can even write a sentence that combines the two of them together so mine says i added a little more it says it is telling me all about my wind speed and how it s going high or low or high what does your say austin mine is it had cold and hot days and it went from 44 degrees fahrenheit to 20 degrees fahrenheit so go ahead just like alexis and austin shared go ahead and share with your face partner this time so that you change who you re talking to so emily and madison you can also share what you wrote it tells me that some times it can be hot and then go down to a little bit colder and then it goes back into hot yeah that s what i was kinda saying when i told the wind speed because it s not always wind speed yeah it s not always wind speed but most of the time when we took it it was mostly in the winter so it would mostly go down like it was 40 then it was 25 then it was 20 and then it was 30 and then it was 30 and then it was 40 and then it was 50 so that s what so john what did you figure out from your data i figured out that it was colder the week we were doing this okay and the wind speed was not very high okay oh yeah yeah so you were in an area that maybe was more protected by the wind do you think yeah we were behind the building oh okay so that might of had an effect too yeah okay did you draw any conclusions from that i forgot to do that okay great braden tell us a little bit about what you observed from your data well i observed that i did not get much wind speed okay so where was your station were you at a protected area as well yes okay so that definitely had an effect didn t it yes so as a meteorologist would you want to be able to put your anemometers somewhere where you know you re gonna catch the wind yep okay so that was a really important lesson right there too so what about your thermometer readings since those weren t dependent necessarily on being protected from the wind what can you observe from your thermometer reading well that it was and then on tuesday and wednesday it got colder okay so it got colder on tuesday and wednesday so if you were making a prediction what do you think would happen on this day based on your data do you think it s gonna change stay the same what do you think stay the same seems like it s gonna stay the same because you have that pretty consistently yeah okay alright tariq what do you find from your data what did you discover observing i noticed that for my temperature i had up and down weather so your temperature was would you say it was fluctuating yeah okay why do you think that was happening because well it was cold on the days we went out but where we were the sun was kind of coming towards us at the times we went out so do you think that had an effect on your thermometer as well yeah hm okay so then that s another thing as a meteorologist you might want to think about where your thermometer is right are you just getting straight sun okay was there something else you were gonna say about your wind speed well my wind speed on monday we got a lot and on thursday we got a lot on the other two days we didn t get any wind not too much okay then then i also had go ahead all three of us were in the same group you were in the same group alright so there you go and i also had to say that my wind speed was never below 20 degrees you to pull out your sheet right there that you have about your temperature on the moon i want to ask you one more question and i want you to think about your temperature on the moon now did you actually go to the moon to get your data no no but let s look at the scientists who recorded that data why was it important for them to find out the temperature on the moon and as you look at it did it change very much so why was it important and did it change very much okay jaime i thought that on one of the missions that it was different temperatures like it would be and then it dropped down to about 200 okay and so you re specifically talking about the day yeah okay and so you re saying is it pretty similar is that you re saying pretty similar but not very okay so the main thing is that it didn t stay the same okay it didn t seem to stay the same no okay and then we had not only day temperature but was the other temperature that we looked at on the moon night nighttime okay so what were you thinking about that shaun i kind of had the same data as jamie did okay because it switched every single mission so on mission 11 it was well 200 and about 13 degrees okay and it just kept on going down and up each mission so it changed significantly each mission,1.0
let s talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company let s start with t shirts r us okay who can explain to me what s going on with t shirts r us devon you have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt okay so you ve got to pay and then what do you pay per shirt six six dollars per shirt okay what are the advantages of that how is this one in some way better than top of the line allegra what s better about this company you only have to pay six dollars per shirt you only have to pay six dollars per shirt so you re telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt right okay what s the disadvantage to this plan who can tell me the disadvantage to this one sarah you have to pay 50 dollars first you have to pay 50 dollars up front okay so if i were going to buy a lot of shirts let s say i was going to buy 200 shirts which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts taylor i think the t shirts r us would be better because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt yeah for this one the more shirts you buy the better deal it becomes right but for this one if you re not going to buy if we were only going to buy for say 10 people would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference probably not okay so for top of the line tees our initial charge the nice thing about top of the line what s the advantage of top of the line they re eight dollars that it raise you hand kevin they re only eight dollars they re already eight dollars but is that their advantage yes no patrick says no patrick is their advantage that they re eight dollars per shirt what s the advantage for top of the line isn t it because the design is free is free so do we have to pay anything up front no no so if cameron if you and i were the only people that wanted to get shirts that would probably be a good place to go right because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars but up here two shirts is going to be expensive right right yeah yeah it would be over 60 dollars right 62 that s not a very good price for shirts okay brett i kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn t really part of the data okay another thing i kind of thought whenever i was working on this last night was if they re charging money for the graphic couldn t it possibly be like a better graphic but it could be it doesn t necessarily mean that it is and i think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable maybe not identical but at least close okay all right so let s look at a couple of different things okay let s start with these tables you guys have had a minute to look at these tables what the first question says which of the following tables represents t shirts r us with this being our given information which one of these tables is t shirts r us tell me how you know amanda the first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts okay so amanda says that this one is t shirts r us and how did you know that you explained that in a really interesting way how did you say that because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts yeah amanda says this one has to be t shirts r us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars yes okay that s one way to say it is there another way lindsay you had something interesting on your paper what s the other way that we can tell whether or not that s t shirts r us i divided 30 divided by five equals six can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five in t shirts there were a five dollar difference the t shirts goes up by five yeah so this one goes up and the cost up by 30 and i just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars so she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five so then to figure out how much each shirt was she divided the 30 by six and figured out oh no not by six 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt so one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change right and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost like what is it that you have to pay up front so in this problem can we see both can we look at this table and see here s what you have to pay up front and then here s what you have to pay per shirt can you see that yes okay write that down all right so look at the table and let s talk about the original question that we asked the original question that i asked you and this was just a pick which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students t shirts r us what did you find out when you really really investigated casey they re both 200 each you really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost 200 dollars 200 dollars so if we were just buying t shirts for our class would it matter which company we chose no no what if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100 bree what do you think if we were going to buy t shirts for all 100 students because at 25 the cost is the same right which one of these is going up more quickly the one on the left the one on the left s going up more quickly what do you think nahla says she disagrees nahla the one on the right is going up more quickly because it s going up by 40 yeah this one s going up how much every five shirts 40 yeah this one s going up 40 and at that same time this one s only going up 30 30 right bree so bree which one s going up faster the right one yeah so they re the same here do you guys see they re the same here you see that bree but if this one s going up faster if i m going to buy a whole if i m going to buy a lot more shirts what s going to eventually happen with this one it will increase it s going to get increasingly more expensive okay so somebody summarize this for me what did we just figure out about tables what did we just explain about tables what can you find on tables sierra tell me what we can find by looking at a table y intercept we can definitely find the y intercept can you tell me how we can find the y intercept when the x value is zero when the x value is zero that s going to be our y intercept that was an excellent explanation guys what else can we find from the graph we can find the y intercept what else can we find samantha we can find the slope we can find the slope and can you summarize how we found the slope we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run yeah we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run excellent job okay so that s tables cameron question is it okay on the table where it says like t shirts in the columns is it okay to put x and y over them cameron if that helps you understand it then yes that s completely fine but you need to understand that x and y represent something right it s okay for you to think about it as x and y but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t shirts and y represents cost okay that s a good question all right now let s look at the graph okay suppose these two graphs were given to you okay look at the graph is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph s set up does the scale set look the same yeah the x axis is identical and the y axis is identical so let s talk about the graph for a second look at the graph adam can you look at that graph and tell me which thing which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line the one on the right the one on the right can you tell me why because top of the line keep in mind the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt how did you pick this one to be top of the line because it started at zero okay so one of the things that s important was that you realized it started at zero so he looked at this and recognized that my he said starts at zero okay that s important how else could we figure out that that was how else could we figure that out allegra i said that since it was five times eight well that s the first coordinate it would be oh okay so the first coordinate was five 40 so you said five times eight is 40 40 okay what about this one that is 80 10 times eight is 80 okay is that an interesting way of thinking about it yes and does that also work does that make sense with this problem starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars so she said five times eight 10 times eight and that pattern would work all the way up is there other ways that i could identify that this is top of the line amanda i went down there on the table that the rate of the pulse goes up faster uh huh so like when you said how did you guys here the word she used to describe that she said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate do you guys agree with that the line s more steep yeah the line has greater steepness is the word you used steep right yeah so this one not only does it start at zero so we can recognize it that way but we also recognize that it s going up more quickly this one s going up eight dollars each shirt and this one s only going up six dollars each shirt because let s look at the rate of change for this one if we went from zero to five that went over five right and then from 50 up to 80 is what 30 that s from 50 to 80 is 30 30 and so 30 over five gives me how much six six per shirt okay nahla you had your hand up yeah go ahead i was gonna say that i understand that it started at 50 so that would be t shirts r us so if that was t shirts r us then the other one had to be top of the line guys did you hear what nahla said nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50 so because that one started at 50 it had to be what t shirts r us t shirts r us okay so so what re we talking about we re talking about looking at a graph and finding two things what are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph greg tell me one slope we need to do our final slope emanuel tell me the other one the y we need to be able to find the slope and the y intercept okay emanuel can you summarize for me how to find the y intercept how do you look at a graph and find the y intercept where the line crosses the y axis where the line crosses the y axis so sierra told us when we re on our table we re looking for where the x is zero the x is zero but on the graph that means that it crosses the y axis okay nice can somebody tell me from a graph how to find slope stella i haven t heard from you for a minute how do we find slope from a graph you use the slope triangle you use the slope triangle uh huh then it leads your eyes for example can we talk about this one it doesn t matter you pick whichever one you d like so it will be the rise and speed it s going up yeah so this is our rise okay and the run is how far it s going out and the run is how far it s going out it s rise over run and then you write it as a ratio rise to run okay excellent guys i have one final question on the graph so we picked these we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right and for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six right would it matter if i did went too far i think would it matter if i did that no i heard no can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that s no so why does it not matter sydney because it s the same shape it s just larger it s a similar figure so i guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it it would be the same did you guys hear what sydney said sydney used the word similar or used the phrase similar figures what do similar figures mean what does that mean greg like two figures that have the like they re they don t exactly have to be the same size it s like basically a dilation of the other it s essentially a dilation okay so the first one we did went up 30 over five right well what about the red one the red one went from five to 20 how much did it go over if it went from five to 20 cameron 15 it went over 15 so if this one goes over 15 you sort of used that word dilation right what s the scale factor from five to 15 positive 3 that s times by positive 3 right so likewise what should this be if my run was 15 what should my rise be raise your hand if you know jaylynn 90 it should be 90 okay so let s check and see if it is so we went from five so that went 15 and then we went from 80 up to 170 now what s the difference from 80 to 170 80 to what 80 to 170 i don t know that s okay what s the difference who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170 sierra 90 the difference is 90 so if i looked at those two ratios so if i looked at those two ratios one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five are those equal yep yes that is let s check it are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt yes yeah so how do we find slope from a graph taylor said we make the slope triangle and does it matter which triangle you pick nope no because they should be proportional they should be dilations of one another okay it be a good reference to something that we learned can you show us how to start out like the first one or the first few pages so the question was do you have to start out at the first one no sydney why no because if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars then you don t have to unlike the other one it started at zero mm hm are you talking about the final slope nahla yes okay nahla you can start at the first point but you don t have to because if it s linear should the pattern ever change no so if the pattern never changes does it matter which two points you pick no any two exact points you pick should still give you the same rate of change that was a great question okay all right so now this is a different one so on the last one i gave you the verbal right i did i said t shirts r us and gave you the verbal expression this time i m not giving you that this time we ve got a third t shirt company the third t shirt company tee time they explain to us this is their function cost cost is equal to 4 50x plus 25 my question is what does that mean who can tell me what it means to do 4 5x plus 25 samantha start me we would charge and 4 50 per each t shirt okay so what do we have to pay no matter what patrick what is the one thing we have to pay if we ordered a shirt what s the one thing they re going to charge us for the design they re going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design right but then each time huh each time well that s a great question do they charge us 25 dollars every time that s a great great great great great question no why not what s the 25 dollars for it s for the design on every shirt it s for the design and that is the design that we re going to use for all of our shirts so that s an important question does the y intercept explain anything about change will the y intercept change will it move up or down no the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is okay that was a great question who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like what would the graph look like it looks like a zero but i think it d start at 25 here it would start at 25 so it s go to start somewhere right in here okay and i m not sure why those numbers are on the table but they shouldn t be there okay but that s okay we can move forward from it we can do this what should the cost be initially 25 the cost should initially be 25 dollars okay then if we buy five shirts how can we figure that out who can tell me how to figure that out ah you can plug in the value of five in the equation thing you can plug into the equation ooh i know what we can use oh we can use i heard somebody say this earlier we can use a calculator right where would i put this information in the calculator y equals i d go to y equals excellent okay and i put it in there my function right so i ve got 4 50x plus 25 and then you press second yeah what am i trying to look at i m trying to look at my table let s go back for just a second look at the table that s already given to us what do they do in their table it increases by five they increase their x values by five so do i want to set mine up to go by fives yes yeah so how do didn t i how do i set up a table where do i do that it s a second and it s on top of a window yeah it s second and it s on top of a window we ve got a table set up where do we want to start our table what s the first number we need five okay because we already know zero right and then how much do we want to increase each time five we want to increase each time by fives okay are we okay with that now where do i go to actually have the calculator give me the information sydney where do i go you press second and then you press the graph button second graph which will give me the table so i will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected because i m going to need you to help me with mine i don t know why i put the wrong table up there okay we good all right so we used the calculator to help us get our table what was it in fives who can help me with this help me with this cameron real quick 47 5 that s 47 5 or 47 50 right what about tens 70,1.0
okay so ready to go here okay i d like to take you back to the fifth century to a time when attila the hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of gaul or western europe much to the chagrin of the roman empire but where i hear you ask is attila the hun himself well i fear he has perished he died in a drunken brawl would you believe on his wedding night and who am i i hear you ask to be telling such a tale why i am mrs attila the hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of gaul javelins and bows and arrows those were very well and good for tacticians such as attila the hun but what do i know about tactics not much so i need something very little you are right josh the hun is right so what i need is to get some sort of a war machine now let s first think about what characteristics do i need in a weapon that would help us against to help us conquer the lands of gaul what characteristics do we need in the weapon what do we need it to do hurt people in other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or force something else so a force we need to have some sort of force range what else i m sorry jackie range range the range would be a good thing especially if we can get beyond bow range right that would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far right steph efficiency efficiency can you tell me more about what you re thinking well being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering all right we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done we need to be able to not perhaps use every single hun for it so efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages yes katie possibly something that you could use again oh yes if we only use it once that s kind of a problem isn t it we want to be able to use it repeatedly good idea other things we want to think about joe something that s mobile all right so maybe wheels might help or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried okay those are good thoughts jackie accessibility like making sure it s easy to use and not like difficult to set up so if it takes a bunch of people and they re struggling to reset it maybe not a good idea something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle all right so we ve had a good deal of ideas so far that s really good so i need some sort of a war machine something that would have all of those properties in it hmmm why what is this message for you mrs the hun a message okay let s see why it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet ooh we have a picture of our new war weapon but here s the challenge i need to build the best trebuchet the best war machine that i can and i m not certain what properties what characteristics what parts of this machine i should emphasize how big they should be how strong they should be so i m going to need you to help me out i m going to make little groups of huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet each group can then test a different quality what sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet to see what would be the best one caroline caroline the weight on the opposite end all right the weight the counter weight and the load both of those things and perhaps the ratio of them could be rather important josh like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle all right the lever arm and how it changes that could be an important idea other things that we might be able to change to vary or test anything else we might be thinking of kate on the angle right there ah yes the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with there s a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it so the angle of launch and changing that could be important anything else we might try anything else we could change we ve had some really good ideas all right so i d like to break you into your small groups and i d like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test we ll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information so i need you to prove your loyalty me huns build this trebuchet and test it and if attila the hun were here right now he d say what are you doing laying your duffs get to work huns let s get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet and you can choose whatever it is that interests you you can choose something that we did or something different but what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work you have to decide i m going to change this part of it and keep everything the same until we take data remind me first of all what it was you were changing counterweight counterweight so you re leaving the same object that you re launching we re just changing counterweight so what is that your weight yes okay so what challenges did you have if any in building this to test your counterweight we had problems with the sling and the pouch like at first we made it really long so like that didn t really work it didn t go anywhere it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself it s kind of like too long so like it so a little engineering before you could quite get one to work but you did then eventually get one by changing the shortening the string and shortening the sling yeah all right so at that point then it looks like you had some data and you took several trials was there anything just off the end any pattern you happened to notice just as you were taking the data we noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like it would float and then just kind of fall so there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it yeah like our data we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like really far to like back again what if i wanted to know not 600 grams or 650 but 625 how could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond if i wanted to know what s going to happen at 775 make a graph or an equation yeah actually either of those would work coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph to me the graph is a very visual way of doing it you could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it s some other sort of a curve all right and that will allow us to look at other data points which i think would be very helpful so your job then between now and wednesday is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were from your trebuchet without sharing all of the numbers but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found i think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down i think that s very interesting the fact that it s consistent so help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data okay all right we can do that hello ready to share trebuchet here s our data okay so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing we were looking for the angle the angle okay and when you were trying to build your trebuchet what challenges if any did you have in trying to test this angle well when we were doing it we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable so it couldn t be like super secure it had to be we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks so it was really easy to move okay it wasn t a super intense trebuchet but it works yeah we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks now i m not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century but i think no like twigs twigs we ll do it with twigs that s a good idea alright so then it looks like you took some data at different angles and you figured out then the range that it went was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data it s okay to say no yeah we noticed you d want to start it like farther back like there d be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle right because then it s because if it was positive it wouldn t really go anywhere starting with angles that made sense that you knew would give you enough energy to start it all right and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try that the farther back you went the greater length that it would go so the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range yes that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one now what limited you or was there a limit you stopped at negative 45 could you have gone negative 50 or no that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small it wasn t like high up to go all the way back ah okay all right you were commenting on being high up when we get together on wednesday and we talk about conclusions we ll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do where if you took the same model but just lift it up lifted it up adapted it see if that would matter all right that sounds good so we ve got several angles to comment on if i wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees or negative 35 or at negative 50 is there some way i could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose yeah you could probably think of an average you wouldn t assume that it would be like 100 accurate we wouldn t guarantee that but it would give a good idea all right so if you did some averaging work if you did some been thinking of actually not so much averaging you could even set it up like like side by side like triangles okay okay so figuring out maybe the ratios yeah that s that you should get here using your when you say your size and dimensions all right and that is an analysis that is so legitimate these are equations you can come up with you do have the option of doing it visually that is with a graph where you have your angles one direction and your range the other just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far you may find that there isn t enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you re certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that s easily recognizable so you get to choose however you want to analyze your data when we come together on wednesday i will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one some groups will find that there s no conclusion that the so that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers so that s your job for wednesday and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test also a bonus that we can measure data okay all right thank you good job the farthest range it was 650 grams for the counterweight six five zero yeah alrighty so that s good so we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that all right very good fifth group tell us about your data and your trebuchet okay our variable was the angle of launch as well angle okay that s good and we analyzed it visually basically and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was the larger the range was the larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that not really it just kind of continues as long as you continue to increase the angle you increase the range so you mean like the angle of release of the sling or the like how far back the arm goes before you let it go how did you measure your angle oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up the larger the distance was okay so the larger the angle to platform like what other angle could we have used the back arm okay and this one was how far we pulled it back yeah so isn t that the same angle then yeah but we just measured it inside all right all right so slightly different perspectives we ve all found angles on all right our sixth group we varied the counterweight also okay counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data we made a chart and a graph okay so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed what did you graph we graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range that s reasonable the counterweight versus range all right and as you examined your chart and the graph data what did you come up with as a conclusion the more weight we put on the further the range was was there an upper limit or not not from the amount of weight that we tested i mean i would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle then it would probably would have bad results so that actually gives us a place to go in future if we were to try to add more to the slab that might be something kind of interesting to find out is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail that might make a difference with our big trebuchet we want the biggest one that was successful were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet josh the angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot all right and in fact if we were to combine that with your counterweight we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would ve liked to have added to or varied steph when the sling did release we could never really tell where it did and we couldn t really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it s supposed to so you could never really tell,1.0
okay so if you re having trouble seeing it you can go back in with a regular pencil brush visible enough for you you can go back in and make it lighter but right now the mark makings you re doing is really good as you want to turn if you re having trouble making curved lines you can turn oh okay all right that helps instead of turning the tool turn the plate and keep pulling towards you okay it might make it a little bit easier to make those curves yeah they re really tough to do other than that it s been fine good is that working now that you what we talked about yesterday with this little yeah shadow i thought it was kind of okay and the same thing that i just told kim if you re having trouble with the curved lines you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve all right but so far what you re doing is good you re adding all these different values continue with that type of texture on the edges because that s working i m just going that s okay be patient have you decided yet how you re gonna treat this area in here no i m probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing okay so adding a different texture are you leaving the text i never i forgot to reprint it so if i do decide you ll just have to reverse the text yeah i know and i ll right add it in that s fine i think i ll just decide it later yeah finish your whole overall design first yes exactly and then if you want the text in it as long as it s reversed so you print it the right way yeah you can just reprint it okay sounds good awesome yeah so you re just yeah all right the way you re doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it s consistent do i have to make it identical no well what do you think are these identical persons it s like supposed to be but i know i m not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but i think it would look fine if it was different i kinda want it to look a little messy you want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one i don t think there s anything wrong with making them separate i know that they re trying to be echoing each other symmetrically yeah but all of the textures can be different okay to add some interest to it i think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side right don t you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway yeah definitely that s good how did you decide that you re going to treat the inside of the mouth area are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light well there s supposed to be some tongue over here but over here i m gonna make it like i m gonna try to go solid black in some parts like i tried to do that inside the mouth yeah that s good that s good i want mine to seem so then all of those areas then will stay dark yeah it ll create a nice shadow excellent that s really good are you gonna go off the edge yeah nice that s really good keep it up and emily how s yours coming yeah the same thing all those little dark areas that you re working on inside in between teeth now that you ve carved out all that area it s gonna create a darkened tone and as i mentioned before all the different stippling areas that s really good it s adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure if you re finding that it s easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table okay good good this is good i m getting confused of where i m going because if i did the backgrounds this is the negative space that i do the crosshatching then it would have to continue down here so you want to decide all the different types of textures that you re using in between all of it yeah all right so you ve got a little bit of the crosshatching here okay and you re using illustrative lines over here so you wanna try and find something in between that s a little bit different right uh huh well you haven t done any stippling texture yet i was working on in here okay so in here s gonna be stippling so right then this can t be the stippling because it s gonna be next to it i was thinking of here kind of moving this pattern down and then maybe just sort of okay i think that would be a good solution to that it s like this area in the background okay now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid and then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture you can go back into it and add it again okay okay so in here like you said follow the movement of these objects okay this is all the chain inside the bike so following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture and then in here just because you have all this texture in here you might not need to put anything else there okay what s your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra yeah it s hard to tell because i m not sure how it s gonna look when it s printed but i think that might be good because it would get kind of crazy i think it might be nice to have and you wanna still have it have a focal point so if you go crazy with other textures in here you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work okay i m having a hard time seeing it so you i might need to get one of those blue sheets okay the blue sheets are working i think you know what emily s been using the table so maybe that helps her to see her white lines that has been helping so if you don t wanna use one of those blue sheets you can do what she s doing and use the table yeah i ll do that i think i wanna lift it off of the book so you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines okay okay you re still working on your design right yeah i think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon yeah because once you figure out what s going on over here yeah i just have to yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong so what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas are you gonna fill them in too yeah i think so okay then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it engraving it i don t know i don t know if i should do really fine crosshatching mm hmm but then should i put a new texture on these what do you think do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print because i think if i texture both of them it ll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture okay so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first you can decide if they re too solid then you can go back in with a different texture okay okay so finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later okay room 221 students enter through a small entryway to their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom this classroom is shared by two teachers storage space is limited in this room i teach three sections of photography advanced placement studio art and advanced placement art history as we open up into the main part of the classroom storage areas are visible for each class photographic prints a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives as i pan the room you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible bulletin boards are set up for project instructions visual examples and critique displays along the back of the room is a dry mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies in the center of the room the printing press is stored for ap studio art and set up to allow for safe and organized used along the right hand side of the room there is a drawing rack for students to store work in progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives there is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents the file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders the large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies and at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept and at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use the projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions some of you are ready to print so i wanted to go through the actual printing press process today some of you might even be ready to try that today if you re not ready to try it right after i do the demonstration you can go back to your etching or engraving and then by tomorrow you ll be able to run it through the press before i do that i wanted to share something with you that s a little exciting and the fact that i actually have a relative who was a professional engraver my grandfather was an engraver he started in the 1930s and 40s after world war ii he was part of something called the gi bill does anybody know what that is oh i do yeah what is it they pay people to go to college yes exactly yeah after the world war ii veterans came back from war the government paid for them to go to college and he went to a college called the art students league which i was just talking with alex about and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver i m going to pass some of these around these are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you you can take some of those so you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time a hundred years at least or even more but this is from the early 30s and 40s these engravings and these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that i explained that we don t do here because of the safety you re doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid so i m going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that i m passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we re working with today and it s kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this so i m going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him all right so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print making ink so for the most part we re going to start with black today but you can choose any color that you want so you can see some of the examples that i put up here from past students one student decided instead of putting black ink on the white ground he used white ink on black ground so that s another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process so all the steps that we re going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week it s going to remind you of all the steps so the first step after you ve beveled all the edges in your plate that i demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print making ink and all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you re ready you ll take a little bit of print making ink and put it on the plate like this just like that and you ll use a tool called a brayer and the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate so once your brayer is filled with the ink you ll apply it to the plate and i m actually using my grandfather s plate from several years ago all right so you ll gently apply the ink over the entire plate okay just take a seat and i ll hand it out all right and after you have the entire plate inked you ll check and make sure that you didn t miss any spots all right notice that i missed a spot there so i m going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered once you have all the areas covered and this is just in interest of time i ll just show you the next step once the entire plate is covered you ll take a small piece of mat board i ll just use this instead okay i have little pieces of mat boards for you okay so you re going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that i have cut up here after you apply the entire ground with ink you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that s going to be on your inside lines this has a dual purpose it removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate this has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you re done this will push all the ink in the surface okay and then once you get most of it removed then you can take the cheesecloth i found one of my mat boards here we go all right so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink and then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front this will lift the ink off pretty easily and after you do this process this is the messy process so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you re done with this before we move to the printing press i ll show you how to do that sometimes a circular motion with this will help so i m going to show so you can all see circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface i m showing you this quickly all the steps but i have one prepared for us to print with just like a cooking show so it s ready to go all right so you re going to use flat on the table i m showing you this so you can see it but you re going to do all of this flat at your desk get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth if you run out of space you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again then the last step before you clean your edges at this point if you want to go clean your hands so you don t get it on anything again you could go clean your hands as well we ll take a piece of newsprint a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper the newsprint works the best so i have cut up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice smooth surface and before you re ready to print you could take a q tip dip it in some water and then clean your edges so the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates you should take the q tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean so this print was left up here for a reason it doesn t have a clean edge i wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn t clean their edge okay this has a nice clean edge this has a little bit of ink left on the edge so when you pull a perfect print you want to make sure you have a clean edge and the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off,1.0
first are your group activity your group creations now you all created in your group sorry you created in your groups eight counts of dance that incorporated in some form or fashion the time step i don t want don t grade right now just look just watch the first one what are you noticing good right so i was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and i could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread or i can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread we re going to keep the white bread for right now pop push then this made me laugh think about this as the heel of the bread i don t get it i m glad to know that you re like i don t get it there s a piece of bread and there s a heel of the bread oh the butt of the bread yeah oh that s why because you call it the butt of the bread oh but it s the heel of the bread ok so not so funny so we have pop push step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread good flap step dig right so today we re going to do pop push step good flap step dig as a review on the right and on the left and then we re going to do pop push flap we re going to add another ingredient flap step dig okay flap step dig now remember this is important why it s the ingredient barely comes up think about it good flap because when you step flap means that it s two sounds to boo ya remember it s two sounds and that s why you say good flap and to get it up she said real high alright everybody up spread out pop push pop push again is spank kick it s exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board put your right heel out i need a good pop push ready and i need a good step as we step what do we do what happens to the body we swing right we sure did pick up that foot good flap step dig alright do it one more time let s do an echo let me do it i ll do pop push step you do pop push step i do good flap step dig you do good flap step dig right right and i go okay i go better ok by now our muscle memory is either going i got it i ve worked it out or i don t got it and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory so here s what i want you to do say pop push step pop push step good flap step dig good flap step dig pop push step pop push step good flap step dig good flap step dig pop push step pop push step good flap step dig good flap step dig right foot out six here you go you take pop push step good flap step dig pop push step good flap step dig you can do a shuffle pop push step good flap step dig you want to okay not too bad look at y all keep on going just like wonderful kids now let me take a dip what i need you to do real quick bunch up right here bunch up do me a favor and bunch up right there do you body roll not really yeah you do no sure you do ok well i got it wrong you don t body roll but you will you rock you rock knee right no come on right hand flap step dig see you re doing this really well alright point your leg listen we re going flap step dig flap step dig ready and right foot step flap step dig yes how is this group doing okay everybody look everybody look here we go five six oh you precious thing are you ready deep breaths you need your right foot out six ready and pop push step good flap step dig almost left foot pop push step left foot good flap step dig okay let me tell you why you re doing a shuffle we do pop push step lift your foot up good flap step dig on left foot pop push step good flap step dig these were all two things okay body roll do a body roll now you can t do a body roll back here hold my hand here we go pop push step shift it over good flap step dig right here good flap step dig did you get all this again the right foot flex your toes good flap step dig good flap step dig bring it in oh no you gotta body roll bring it in good flap step dig that s better and since the problem is your weight distribution it s back here and it s hard to do it like this so you gotta do like this yeah okay alright let me see the middle group middle group right foot out ready oh sorry i got all excited you were ready six ready and pop push step yes okay let s go pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig ready right foot and pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig yes left foot left foot left foot six ready and pop push step good flap step dig almost almost i saw it on the right do it on the left real quick left foot and pop push push your heel down base let me hear some base do it again pop push step pick up that foot good flap step dig good flap step dig left foot good flap come on baby with the lift with the lift oh sorry my bad my bad to the right good flap step dig that s it show some love very nice alright this group come on right foot out six ready and pop push step oh i got overachievers i love it this time with the hold punched in it now let me see the hold six ready and pop push step hold for a second good flag step dig left foot pop push step hold for a sec good flap step dig love it let s take out the hold let s take out the hold pop push step good flap step dig pop push step good flap step dig five six right foot ready and pop push step good flap step dig and ready stop you know what not so bad alright this is what we re going to do we re going to move on we re going to move on i want to see pop push flap pop push flap on the right foot put your right heel out put your right heel out we re gonna go pop push flap where s my head over you over the front of the body that s right five six ready and pop push flap five six ready and pop push flap yes five six ready and pop push flap five six ready and pop push flap not bad five six last time in push and freeze we re going to take a second piece of bread that heel and go good flap step dig it happens with the left foot five six ready and good flap step dig you already know that part isn t that fabulous so we re going to put together pop push flap flap step good five six right foot goes pop push flap flap step dig oh wah say it for a second pop push flap flap step dig pop push flap flap step dig pop push flap flap step dig say it pop push flap flap step dig pop push flap flap step dig pop push flap flap step dig let me see the next move in the shower be careful you might slip that s a hazard always safety first yes okay andra in walmart in walmart really love it okay i do mines in kroger do you find okay i do mines in the kitchen you do yours in the kitchen does your mom yell at you no be careful like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there all year okay so jasline do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class no cause i m quiet because you re quiet well number one i m super proud of you for practicing everywhere and do you find that you do it all the time in the store in the school so it s not just something that you re going to do in class you see this and what you re going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go oh well i continue to do this and i m not even taking tapping i wish i could go find and tap more okay when that s gonna happen because it is going to happen to you it s like a bug it s like a virus you just get all excited and all that go to youtube for me and on youtube there are lots of how to videos do you know you could look up how to do this time step on the youtube video now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc buck times step no no it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich a different kind of time step so if you re ever curious and you want to continue this through like because you re gonna do you have to have tap shoes by the way no no what do you have to have hard floor tammy sit up for me you what a shoe with a hard bottom yeah look i m in heels right that s all you have to do now one of the things that i wanted to point out to you as we re about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers i want you to look at weight distribution say weight distribution weight distribution what is weight distribution can i use an example yes like when we re doing the good flap ball change you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step beat okay so great jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back and sit it back down for the step dig anybody had something to add shift your weight yes you re right you shift your weight which way opposite of which way you switch your knee oh opposite of which way of whatever foot i m using because if i have this foot up i ve got right does my body have to turn no no but it kind of does don t it got some hip action going on right here alright anybody else see any weight distribution we can do the sink you re kind of down a little bit okay i was going to say i was trying to get to you the weight distribution doesn t necessarily have to go right to left right or front to back it can go up and down what is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered so we can move move to have to have a better base for what okay so we can keep the rhythm because if the rate of speed speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it right tell me how different how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males anybody know the difference we covered this one where s the woman s center of gravity in her glut you are absolutely correct in her glut right through here and that s where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers her center of gravity around her belly the baby belly and around idk oh idk alright you don t know so where is the men s center of gravity where do they tend to torso torso right their diaphragm and that s where we get that spare tire from a man s center of gravity and this is what it means are we here there we are here s what it means as the woman s center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you re fine and dandy a man if this is him he s going forward he s going to fall he s not going to be able to keep his weight so it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution yes let s look really quickly oh how many of you have taught your significant adult you taught a significant adult and you taught the time step what did you see anybody sometimes your parents got the rhythm has lost if your parents are a little older than most average parents let s say like 40s to 50s good good their rhythm has kind lost it it takes a longer time to teach them they have to be concentrated because they re like uh uh do that again do that again okay jasline that is awesome i m going to put you on hold for a minute because i have heard from you several times let me hear from somebody new come on audrey i found that i really got my skills from my mom my fast learning skills you got your fast learning skills from your mom awesome she learned real fast she picked it up good alright who else instead of teaching a significant adult i taught my whole family to tap you taught your whole family rock on i found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother so why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom i think she slowed down over the years over the years okay okay let me hear from somebody up here because i haven t heard anything from up here while i was teaching my mama my daddy got excited and he wanted to so i taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and right competition and my mama she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time once he got it he could do it over and over again he actually got pretty good like speed wise see tap is for all ages guys it ll keep you in good health it s something fun it ll keep you active you don t have to learn a certain you know we learned a step and i hate to teach a step but that s the beautiful thing about tapping it s you can come up with all kinds of stuff and you know hey look here i want you to hear how many of you like step step dancing oh all around the room oh we love the step dancing right step and tap are similar do you see the correlations you re making rhythms there are prescribed movements so we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing you just never know you might have tap groups all around let s go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick i want you to watch the screen now what i want you to watch,1.0
why do they keep getting colder why do they keep getting warmer they add water to it maybe they add water to it okay what else the thermometer what about the thermometer they could have lights lights well did they turn off the lights afterwards okay at this point at that point maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it the thing is ultimately are we gonna know what they did unless i was video taping you during that whole process there are a couple things i wanna point out here in a second i think several of the ideas are possibilities what happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially what do you need to do as soon as you put it in there what do you need to do do you immediately start taking readings yes everybody agrees we immediately start taking readings as soon as we put it down in there like the first second we start taking readings we take a thermometer put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings like what s the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point okay so we need a starting point what were you going to say if you put it in there like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature it wouldn t change immediately yes so it goes 22 21 19 18 it s going down so what could have been the issue here they took it at the very beginning good good they just didn t wait long enough look at this one i saw this in one particular group because by the way you guys realize you were doing some very very different things right as we were doing and collecting this data there were some major differences what could have happened what was going on here just the obvious stuff observation what s the difference in the pattern yes ma am the hot water is like consistent like it s just gonna stay at the current temp hot water stays hot right cold water is doing what increasing in temperature it s increasing in temperature the room temperature water is doing what it stays the same with this same group i just happened to catch this cold water luke warm water the person was doing this this is the warm water oh laughs body heat keeping it warm insulating it what was happening transfer of heat we re gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks this doesn t seem like a big deal right i mean would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this you ve gotta start thinking like scientists though because that could be a huge deal if we re doing something with temperature right okay good well the obvious or the observation what s going on with the cold water it s increasing it s increasing okay luke warm water staying the same the hot water it s getting cold it s getting cold okay what s different from the first slide yes the hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water did it actually happen to somebody did it actually happen yeah let s do this first let s go back to here what word would you use to describe what s going on here what s all this heading towards room temperature it s all headed towards room temperature there s a fancy word that starts with an e we may have talked about this last year the fancy word the idea there s a word i want you to walk away with the word is equilibrium okay how does this show equilibrium rebecca how does this show equilibrium with the hot water how does this show equilibrium rebecca it s sierra it all goes toward the same it s kind of like the hot is increasing and it s temperature the hot is what i m sorry i meant the cold the cold is increasing in it s temperature and then it s going towards the room temperature it s going towards room temperature the hot is decreasing in temperature and it s going towards the room temperature also is this what we would expect all right so what happened because i don t have any idea what happened here yes in some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out so maybe that one cup was under a lot of air we do have some powerful air vents what do you guys think is that that s a huge amount any other ideas yeah i think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature down for a hot cup is it possible there s human error here and they just they looked at the wrong thing maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot so there s mixing the water thermometers maybe just read them wrong so you guys think some kind of human error then yes yes let s go back to this and let s go to the next step kind of like what we ve done in the past i want you to think of this at an atomic level a molecular level what s happening here in order to do that we re gonna play with bbs i ve got enough sets of bbs here each group is gonna have a set of bbs all right so group up a little closer together alright so you two maybe go around you guys here s what i want you to do within your group one half have one set actually the two of you can marcus good here s what i want you to do the bbs will be what atoms atoms and molecules okay are atoms and molecules just sitting no when we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower faster when we take away energy they re going to go slower or rather than take away when they release it i m gonna give you a couple minutes i want you to talk within your groups i want you to be able to do three things i m gonna call people up here in a second i m gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your bbs i want you to be able to simulate the top line the middle line and the bottom line so getting cooler room temperature staying the same and getting warmer i also want kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium all right talk to each other real quick some are getting cooler some are getting hotter some are staying the same temperature and how would you show equilibrium i ll give you about a minute or two all right everybody take a look at your bbs hands off bbs i got a volunteer what were the bbs again atoms atoms and we re trying to show what movement towards equilibrium movement towards equilibrium what energy energy and movement how those go together energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it okay everyone take a look at the chart here s the graph show me the top line and tell me what you re doing make it faster because it s hotter it decreased because it s going down and getting less heat okay so it s gonna start the bbs are going to start going fast and then slowing down slowing down could you show us yeah we re in an awkward spot getting warmer the bottom part of that chart at first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it s getting warmer thank you i m gonna do room temperature i think room temperature would be this and it stays the same kenny what well it s gotta be moving right room temperature would just be this and i have to do what oh i probably should have picked the same group the two of you working together how could you show us equilibrium of going towards equilibrium she s going to do cold okay and you re going to do hot okay good now time out what did you do or were you not done i started out fast and she started out slow why did you start out fast because i was hot and you were cold cold and lauren what did you do the same speed which was getting close to equilibrium show us one more time good who disagrees nobody good thank you here we go keep going a couple more things real fast most of you guys had this going about six seven eight nine anywhere from six seven to 15 minutes of data if we did this for an hour what would this look like they would eventually all be on the same line for a while and it would be pretty boring so this would keep going well what would be the lowest point room temperature this would be the highest point then this would still continue the same what s the word equilibrium here s how all this started this whole lab that you guys put together and created it s a demo here s how it all started i asked you a question yesterday a couple days ago jar bag with some water in it scarf although i told you gloves and then aluminum foil we came up we felt all four of these things and you made a predic well the question was if we put these outside left them there overnight you look outside your window,1.0
where do i have more potential energy at position a or position b matt position a why because it s fully stopped before it s there it s already moving a little bit what else why does this point here point a have more potential energy than point b so this is a this is b does everyone agree that position a has more potential energy raise your hand if you agree with that okay now who can tell me why why does position a have more potential energy than position b it has more potential to do work why has potential to do work yes why it has a greater height it has a greater height who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class i did okay so going back to gpe when you have a pendulum swinging back and forth types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy and potential energy specifically we can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy if you focus your attention here what is that a pendulum a pendulum similar to what you have here actually you guys within the next week you ll actually be working with the simulation it s effect simulation they re online they re free for you to use and they re nice because they allow you to play i know you like to a play a lot i like to play yes matt you will be working with this but i just wanted to show you another application of this just in a different format when we swing the pendulum what s going to happen it s gonna move it s going to move and at point here and here let s say a and b what type of energy is being represented potential potential energy who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented you wanna come up sure between a and b so every place along the path between a and b does everyone agree with ali yes yes okay where is gravitational potential energy at its max wanna go up and point at points a and b right so everyone agree on the two ends where would kinetic energy be at its max where is kinetic energy at its max right here why because it s lowest what else so we said here let s label this point c we already used a and b why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here that s when the potential energy is at its lowest great that s where potential energy the gravitational potential energy is at its lowest and if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula what does the formula state what variables involved in the kinetic energy formula matt mass and velocity mass and velocity what can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it s swinging along its path back and forth from a to b what can we infer about the kinetic energy it s terminal velocity is well we re not gonna say terminal velocity the object isn t falling it s attached what can we conclude about the velocity at point c any thoughts garrett greatest it s at its greatest when the pendulum is at this point it stops at each point a and b our two end points it stops for a split second because it has to do what maddy did you say it turn around it has to turn around when it swings back down what s happening to the velocity is it increasing or decreasing increasing so if the velocity is increasing what s gonna happen to the kinetic energy value it s also going to increase now if i show you a graphical representation who can describe the graphical representation like a downward okay ali as it moves i guess it swings back and forth the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point it s the highest and then when it reaches points a and b the potential energy gets highest so does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with yes yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy i can stop it at certain areas sometimes it comes out better than others it is somewhat on its way back but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy and if i m really good i can maybe try and get it in the middle close enough it s hard to stop it right in the center but you notice that the potential energy does what decreases and your kinetic energy will increase increase rather and you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point c one other factor that s involved here there is one other type of energy or form of energy that s involved can anyone think of it celini thermal thermal energy mechanical mechanical thermal thermal garrett you had your hand up thermal thermal who agrees with thermal raise your hand wait actually no is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum no that s mechanical thermal if you re saying thermal energy what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum what is the pendulum doing right now it s moving through the air air when objects move through the air what can occur or what is present air resistance which is a form of friction friction is or is not friction an example of heat energy is or thermal energy yes so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present yes yes now how come it s not showing up on the graph there s no friction there s no friction so what i like about this and like i said you guys will be using the simulation and one of the options you have is to change the value for friction right now i have no friction so it s not showing up on the grid so if i increase the friction you re going to see how the value for thermal energy will change also when you apply or work with the simulation you can actually change the mass of the ball or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself and those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days so let s add some friction let s go about halfway what s happening to the friction it s increasing it s increasing on every swing it s increasing with every swing and the pendulum is not reaching points a and b anymore and the what it s not reaching points a and b anymore why what s happening here we have all these types of forms of energy what s happening the air resistance slowing it down the air resistance could be slowing it down want a little more falls away lots of friction and what s gonna happen ali losing particles it s not losing particles i m not losing any mass we re not changing the mass we re not changing the particles if there s a great deal of friction it s losing energy it slows down does it lose energy how many of you think it loses energy raise your hand how many of you think otherwise what happens to the energy that was present we had colorful bars matt said it s colorful we had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy now we have these great big red bars representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now what happened in this simulation ali i don t know that but because in the definition of thermal energy that s the total potential or kinetic energy in an object so there is potential and kinetic energy involved yes steven you wanna try and help him out the energy gets transferred to thermal exactly the energy gets transferred to thermal energy what does the word transfer mean or transform what does that mean you know the movie transformers you guys are not too young for that right i had a transformer i did jessica it changes it changes if we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened what could we say that we learned about the energies involved what would be the main concept the thing you just learned which steven and jessica proceeded what happened to the energies who can restate what they just stated matt or maybe give a definition energy is transferred but not lost okay energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost so what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy would you agree with that statement raise your hand if you agree and what does the word transform mean bella change good change so you changed we began with what kind of energy at this position elaine potential potential ailsa it changed to kinetic kinetic it changed to potential potential changed back to kinetic kinetic and we also have some thermal energy involved is everyone clear on that concept what you re going to do with your group get out a sheet of paper a piece of scrap paper or you could use the back of your packet is fine there s a blank spot on there one paper per group per group okay what you re going to do i m showing you two objects i brought in props for you guys today real life this is my toaster from home aw is it a brave little toaster what i want you to do you have two examples stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in it is turned on the blades are moving what i want you to do to these two objects i want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects but what i want you to do is take it a step further i want you to tell me or place in order what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed so you begin with you might have a thought what type of energy do i begin with in order for the toaster to work what type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on and i want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation you re gonna get about two to three minutes to do this i would like every person in the group to participate you all should be able to share your ideas freely respect what other people are saying and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies any questions before you begin any questions okay see it like stops here like that s potential energy and well if you look at the fan i purposely turned it on so the blades are doing what they re moving are they doing work yes base your forms or types of energy on what you see the blades are moving it is turning okay if you want to list the energy you begin with put an arrow put the next form of energy put an arrow put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that s involved with the two objects is it turning right now do you all agree on that i would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that wait wait wouldn t they both be nuclear energy nuclear energy yes because it s think about your definition of here you put the energy for toaster i would write it down sucked in i don t have the jolt in that look i don t have the toaster plugged in don t burn yourself but let s look and observe three of you do you feel anything yes do you see all those little black pointy things when you put something in there and you turn it on i don t know what you call those things but they like the coil yeah the coil yeah yes they do that s how you generate the heat if you had the toast it would turn on how about in the oven coils inside what colors do they turn orange they turn orange the same thing they turn orange so do you think that there s a form of energy involved here yeah magnetic that s right oh but you discovered it on your own,1.0
ah okay okay suri does this only happens in vinegar or can it happen in water try it tomorrow we re going to experiment more with this okay this is can i have your attention up here again i m just trying to help you by sharing observations i hear when i go around the room somebody had a question and i love questions they said does this happen when you put it in water the same way that it happens if you put it in vinegar because i have told you all it s vinegar if you have questions like that could you please write them on the side so that i know what investigations you d like to do in the future so we can because we re going to be continuing this now once you ve made all of your observations you still have that column like we ve had from every little activity today that says what could be happening so let me be more specific i want you to tell me again the title of the lab is where s the matter i want you to tell me where that tablet went i want you to look at your observations i want you to be specific and i want you to tell me where s the matter what happened to the tablet okay in that last column you should only have one box to fill in please discuss it with your lab group and write down where it went what happened to it and then we ll all discuss it together it can do both can t it so you think it turned into a gas you think it dissolved and turned into a gas okay so you can absolutely write both next thing we re going to talk about is how we prove that so if any of you guys have a really quick idea think about how you can do an experiment okay so keep thinking along those lines because you re going to design your experiment for it okay i have balloons i see the word dissolves i saw the word fizzy and escape okay alright i m going to write down some of these words that i m seeing i saw dissolved i know i saw escaped fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped but thank you for reminding me did you have fizzy separately yeah oh okay on your observation sight or what could happen yeah what could happen what could happen okay blended okay i had gas you had chemical reaction bubbles did i pretty much get the kinds of things you think may have happened any any totally different ideas that you think happened you think it was still it became carbon dioxide okay alright alright focus up here then good i see the same mixture when i did the first demonstration first thing you said was magic then someone said chemical reaction dissolved disappeared changed neutralized i see the same combination of words dissolved escaped fizzy blended vanished chemical reaction magic i just see a little different priority okay now i m a scientist i can t really test magic can t really test if something was magic what i can test are the science type words i can test chemical reaction i can test blended i can sort of test fizzy escaped dissolved these i can test i can try to figure out a way to determine whether the tablet dissolved or escaped or a combination of both i can figure out if it being fizzy had something to do with it i can figure out if it was blended in i can figure out if it was a chemical reaction or i can let you do this and that s what i m going to do on your other half sheet you should have another half sheet on your table first thing i need you to do is in your group i need you to come to a consensus that means you guys have got to agree the first question on there says okay where s the disappearing matter but i asked you to think about it in terms of everything you ve seen today i magically changed clear liquid into pink liquid and then pink liquid back into clear liquid again you saw a candle magically get shorter and the wick magically disappearing and some black stuff come out of nowhere and you saw an alka seltzer tablet vanish okay so your group needs to agree on an overall theory where s the disappearing matter i want you to discuss it and i want you all to write the exact same sentence for where s the disappearing matter at the top of your paper okay so you have to agree there was a small piece that i put in right now and the alka seltzer went up so you know that it goes to the bottom not to the top okay that s a great observation because its very specific i like it so you all need to talk about okay so in every single experiment it turned into a gas so the pink liquid turned into a gas and the white liquid turned into a gas and when the clear liquid went pink liquid the wax turned into a gas i didn t even see it disappear oh when you blew it out you saw smoke so when you blew it out the amount of smoke that went off do you think it was equal to the amount of candle that s missing oh the liquid was a solid this is a gas so tell me about the liquid again because i only saw liquid so i keep if the pink was less dense than the white if the density explained it have you ever seen liquids that have different densities combined have you ever seen oil in water okay so what does it look like when you have two different density liquids did you see layers with the where d the pink stuff go disappeared by itself okay so these are the things you guys have to talk about you can t just take one person s you guys gotta make sure you all agree and it has to be an explanation that explains all three events that we saw today so when i say where s the disappearing matter you tell me it turned into a gas i m going to say okay then the pink liquid turned into a gas i didn t see bubbles okay so it has to be a sentence that explains it all you guys aren t talking here okay the disappearing matter is in the liquid so you still think the alka seltzer tablet is in there okay so you think it s in there but it s now bubbles okay it s in there but it s now bubbles so it changed in to bubbles and then what about the pink liquid and the clear liquid you think it s all still in there okay but that time no bubbles but it s still in there okay so candle where did the rest of the wick go is it still there okay so you were good for two out of three but you can t say it s still in there for the candle so change your sentence talk about it change your sentence just a little bit i get that you re saying that right but change your sentence a little bit so it applies to all three events okay what s your sentence that everyone has agreed on that matter turns into so you had bubbles in your candle no oh this is supposed to be to explain all three events we saw today okay this is a good start but it has to be more general where is the disappearing matter in general today dissolved is good for this one is this one dissolved nope okay so can you think of something dissolved and melted have in common so you can make it one sentence to explain everything okay doesn t show up anymore does that mean it s gone okay that s where you have to agree you have to agree whether it is gone or not okay okay stop for just one second i talked to a couple of really good groups but a couple of groups are very stuck because they disagree i told you you all had to agree and you had to explain all three things it s like the most difficult thing you can possibly do he won t listen to you i hear you okay i m listening here s the thing in the disagreements i ve seen the disagreement is is it gone or is it not gone does that make sense okay did it go away did it disappear or is it still in there that s the disagreement now i have an idea what if we let s pick one experiment okay i think for this class the easiest experiment to deal with would be the tablet the alka seltzer and the vinegar okay write that down on that half sheet as the experiment we chose the experiment we chose the alka seltzer we re going to choose that as a class what are the materials we put in the tablet and the vinegar write those down on that left side it says materials we put in do we put in anything else i didn t trick you i swear okay so we had vinegar and we had a tablet what did you see come out bubbles we ve got bubbles so write those on the right hand side we ve got bubbles fizz he thinks he s saying he thinks the fizz is carbon dioxide that s fine we can call it whatever you want and what some kind of guess and what else are you left with anything else you re still left with some liquid right okay so write that down you re left with you ve got bubbles and you re left with bubbly liquid here s what i think we need to prove we need to prove if what we put in is the same as what we got out how we can tell if something s there if we can t see it in science okay you ve got bubbles what do you think nick we weigh the vinegar and the alka seltzer tablet we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards and see of the number s the same,1.0
tilted towards the sun you re closer to the sun which is heat which means you re going to be warmer when you re tilted away from the sun then there s less heat because you re farther away from it it s going to be colder that s what changes the seasons once again it goes in orbit like you said the closer we are to the sun or the father away once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit i think that tilt causes the seasons and the closer we are tilted to the sun that means it s like summer or spring then if we re tilted back it s winter or fall i m kind of understanding what you guys are saying because i m thinking of it as like say like the globe that s sitting right there say that ben was the sun you can use that if you d like say that ben was the sun the sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe because the globe s tilted so there wouldn t be much sun at the top of the sphere because that s the most tilted away from the sun so it would cause summer lower and on the other side it would cause winter why are you shaking your head i disagree i think the sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom because like antarctica and stuff always cold and it s at the bottom so i think it hits more in the top and in between like by the equator because as you go down south it s more warmer but still if you go down way down to antarctica it s totally freezing they don t get no sun that s not right because there is like sunlight in antarctica and stuff it s just cause like the latitude and longitude and like because because antarctica s at zero degrees so it s cold down there i want to know when the sun is going in its orbit if it just goes from this to this like boom or if its turning and its like facing the sun like that like i don t understand that okay so our question is what like when you re going around the sun and its on its axis like this tilted and it goes around eventu does it just like go like that like real quick and then it s like shifted so the bottom is getting more light and that would put us in winter what do you think kaylie you haven t said anything do you think that our our tilt s going to just change no i think it s like whenever we re rotating like it goes around the sun in the orbit can i show she s saying that as it s rotating it s staying the same it s just that it s changing because you re changing position from which way the sun is can i show an example with the globe yeah please say the sun was in the middle say like the globe is right here say we re right here it s summertime really close and the sun s right here and as we go around like maybe like we re right here and this is fall and then we go to winter and as we turn this way for the spring and then we re back to summer again because we re going around the sun so but the only problem with that is we re still going to be tilted away when it when we go over towards the sun we re still going to be tilted away won t we well the earth s always tilted yeah but we ll be tilted away in the summer you re tilted towards the sun let s go back to does the tilt change okay so we re definitely talking about this tilt and i m guessing there s a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt yes so if you think you understand the tilt help everybody else understand we re not getting this tilt in what you re talking about so explain it the best way you can and help each other okay so i don t get this tilt does it just flip flop what do you think anna i think it stays the same what about you shana you haven t said anything yet well as the earth goes around in its orbit it shifts just like a little bit that way you re like closer to the sun and then during the winter we re father away is that how it is we re closer towards the sun in the summer and we re father away in the winter yes who doesn t think that could i try something with the globe real quick yes could i borrow nick to be my sun yeah be his sun nick come on sun go out there and stand in the middle pretty dark sun yeah you are okay we re gonna say that this little pin here is where the sun is hitting today all right and we re spinning woah spinning that way it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning but it never it never tilts back towards the sun that s what i don t understand does it just go like this this is a really good question this is a really good question now i want wait don t move yet i want go ahead be the sun still and i want you to walk around and explain to people what you re talking about number one show us the tilt okay that s the tilt show everybody the tilt okay everyone this nick move you re in the way of people just duck down just crouch and this is the way of the tilt the way it s tilted that way but as we go around it s still tilted that way and this side here is still far away so what it s going to stay winter all the time or is it just going to like flip and be like hey guys look now we re summer but we re upside down that s what i don t understand he has a very good question okay his question is why is what hemisphere are you talking about the northern hemisphere okay so why is the northern hemisphere always tilted towards the sun how he s walking away because his argument is that oh i have it right here go ahead it says because the earth s axis is slightly tilted when the north pole is laying towards the sun and south pole is laying away from the sun and when the south pole is leading towards the sun the north pole is leading away from the sun it says as a result the number of daylight hours in the northern and southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator the hemisphere that leads towards the sun has a long day and short nights does that have to do with anything see i wait does that have to do with anything that s sabrina s question does that have to do with anything so summarize what you just read to us does the tilt have like also have to do with like the days and like the short days and short nights does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights and long days and short nights shawn you re shaking your head yes you think it does have to do with it say yes yes you think it does have to do with it why who could help him explain why would a tilt change the length of day move over lucas because like it s if like it ll be indirect sun if it s tilted away from it and instead of like i don t know i think it is because i think another thing in the direct rays because the way we re tilted it s the number of daylight hours because of the less sun as much of the sun because of the tilt and how the sun hits it when its on its tilt i think like see how it tilted that way no why don t you use it why don t you boys sit down and let pass that globe over to byers and let him explain what i think is you know how it s tilted this way maybe it ll tilt the opposite direction for the summer like instead of it being tilted towards this it ll tilt the other way for the south instead of the north be showing the south would be showing that s what i think where is the sun that s what i m not understanding the sun would usually be in the middle you need a hand yeah okay go ahead be the sun again the sun s in the middle and that s why if it s tilted this way we re getting our sun but i thought if it would tilt the opposite way like instead of being tilted this way it d tilt that way then the south would get more sun okay so how but what you re asking is the same question as lucas yeah how does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the sun that s what you re trying to figure out whenever lucas walked it around the whole time what hemisphere was pointing towards the sun the southern hemisphere was pointing towards the sun and the northern hemisphere was pointing away from the sun ben no i thought it was the northern was pointing to the sun and the southern was pointing the other way but it remained constant the whole orbit yes that s what i couldn t figure out like how did it just like did it like flip around and all of the sudden maybe the sun it changed what do you guys think does the sun move jj you haven t been in here yet i think like every day it moves a little to the other side wait what does the earth the earth moves everyday yeah it might like it tilts every day it tilts the tilt is changing is that what you re saying so the tilt changes what were you gonna say i think the it the earth like doesn t move like when it stays in one spot i think it might like flip like kind of like just go around like can you show us do you wanna show us sure i ll try i was gonna say maybe like as it s as like the earth turns around maybe it like tilts forward every so often and backward so you re telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips yes okay so what are you saying it just goes around like this and eventually it just like spins around so it spins on top of its rotation yeah what do you think brad i think yeah i kind of agree with him wait with who with david while it s like going around its orbit it just like tilts so the tilt is changing yeah what do you think alec you haven t said anything yet i don t agree with him i think that it spins while its moving around don t raise your hand you don t have to raise your hand only this like what nick just did or maybe every day it goes a little bit and tilts like this and the sun hits more of the southern it s like everyday goes a little bit little bit little bit so where the south starts to get more sun because like when we re in summer and australia has winter so when we re in winter australia has summer so and it s in the southern half and we re in the northern half wait tiffany you were shaking your head do you agree with what he s saying sort of yeah because if one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight the most likely it s gonna be warmer than the other like he was saying when we get more sunlight and the temperature s warm up here the temperatures in the southern hemisphere get a little colder if they don t have as much sunlight and not as much warmth you see what i mean like say i m right here the sun is tilted so you see how the sun s right here and then it tilts a little bit like this we re still getting summer sunlight but australia s getting more sunlight i have to agree with what jj said earlier it tilts everyday so the tilt is changing you think that the tilt is changing morgan you think the tilt is changing no i don t think it s changing i think it s staying the same because even i think the rotation helps because if it goes around the orbit even though its rotating it helps like nick you re the sun like and the axis stays and when it rotates the earth rotates and it s like kind of it like helps us i don t know like indirect sunlight i don t know something like that i can show what she means i think go ahead i think it s also about the gravitational pull like when it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull as it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull okay when you do this grace please explain to me what it is so that everybody here that s watching can try and make sense of what we re talking about i think what she s saying is like say nick s the sun again since the northern is that way i think she s saying is it doesn t rotate but this is but we re kind of going around kind of like this so then it changes so now the southern is towards the sun and the northern is that way so now it s changed she did something very different in her orbit did anybody catch that yeah yeah like she it didn t move it just went around like around the sun what do you mean it didn t move the earth stayed still and just moved at one point it didn t do that okay let s do it again okay and i want you to make sure that number one everybody sees where you start and everybody sees what happens to the earth as she s showing you how it s going around so explain to us what is this where are we starting okay we re starting out this way with the northern towards the sun and the southern away from the sun and as we are rotating i don t know if all of you guys can see this but as we re going around stop there it s not moving so since it s not moving now the northern is kind of like facing away and the southern is facing towards the sun now keep going and then just make sure that the camera can see what you re talking about as you go around okay so did everybody see that who doesn t understand that who didn t understand what she did right there okay so now i don t understand actually wouldn t it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis and then start rotating again i m not sure what you mean by that like you spun it like this all right but the earth is going like this the whole time would that end up stopping and then it go like this or is that still happening it s not turning like that it s just rotating around the sun wait sabrina you had something to say okay so here s what s happening lucas is a little confused about your explanation okay so we just have to go through it again what did you have to say sabrina the earth doesn t change its tilt it stays like an exact same position but when it goes around the sun it gets like different ways like the sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers okay wait why don t you try to show him maybe it s just a different person maybe it will help explain it okay so the more people we can get information out of remember the more we re gonna understand so start and tell us what s happening and just make sure the camera can see what you re doing the northern hemisphere is towards the sun and the southern is facing away so this causes colder weather and up here where it s facing the sun causes warmer weather so when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here the southern is facing towards wait is the southern facing towards the southern s facing towards the sun and the winter is facing away which causes it to be warmer down here and winter up here who can help her out because what i don t understand is go ahead go ahead i don t understand it because it s still changing from day to night but then it s shifting so wouldn t it have to stop spinning and then shift if it stops spinning we re gonna die not necessarily okay wait ben start from the beginning and explain what s going on nick is our sun still put your legs in so he doesn t trip northern hemisphere is towards the sun southern s away and it s still spinning it doesn t change okay and so stop there and what s happening the southern hemisphere s towards the sun and the northern s away from it and what happened to the tilt the whole time it didn t change it what it didn t change it didn t change it stayed the same but that made more sense like i couldn t figure out why it wasn t spinning but now i do and then it keeps going and then it just goes back now i understand okay let s use this model and try to figure out where are the seasons happening so where do we live anna we live yeah where he s pointing what s that called somebody america north america north america let s get bigger northern hemisphere what byers the northern hemisphere okay so we live in the northern hemisphere right now what s happening it s summer it s summer in the northern hemisphere does everyone see that yes yes anybody not see it s summer in the northern hemisphere see it yeah okay so,1.0
nfl yeah so here s like you can see that the professional players who can pay that money they re really rich so there s so much sponsors that they pay for their helmets but like in high school football what they want is long pass cheaper material so they don t care much about the health about the guys they want to go just their problem is the money of the helmets how much cost of helmet is like helmets with kevlar or that stuff like they use in the military equipment so how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can save these thoughts so what kind of ideas you guys have how could you design a helmet so it s not this big or really neat and super expensive the type of padding we use so what ideas do you guys have so what kind of so you play football what kind of padding right now is inside of the helmet i mean they re not soft it s like it s air glove it s almost like a hard balloon stuck to your head so it s just one on the side and the whole top is full and one on the other side and one in the back but that s it i mean you could actually feel the hit but it you just don t get a concussion unless you re heavy so have you ever been hit have you ever had a helmet to helmet contact so where did you get hit my head almost like right here on top of your head right but there s padding there oh but you said you could still feel it i mean i could feel it for like a quick couple of seconds or so then it just goes away it s because of the padding i guess it s umm it s like so is there any way that you would change the design of the helmet that you have now um more cushion okay so that s kind of going back to what angel was talking about so how can we change the design to make it more cushiony but because if you have something that s too cushiony right is that going to decrease the time or increase the time and decrease the force if it s really cushiony oh that s really cushiony yeah oh you mean like it will just go yeah no right so you re saying you want it more cushiony you re saying you want it cheaper you re saying you want it smaller i think like what matt s kind of saying is more for comfort than for safety right right so why so can you relate sort of to what angel s saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous umm with the head rattling like if it hits on this side it s quicker to hit the other side is that what you mean what so how so think about how the padding is right now how it s stiff compared to something that kind of gave so think about relating this back to force times the change in time you can ask if it s built too soft it s going to hit you with a stronger force so what could happen to the time it s going to be slower it s going to be faster it s going to be faster so what s going to happen to the force the force is going to increase so it s going to hurt even more and it will be more dangerous so what you need is like a stable material that not too soft but at the same time so besides kevlar which you brought up which is i was thinking like like for example when you are hit and you re hit you want that like bulletproof that the force spreads in all the space of the body of the helmet so is you are hit here all the force is not concentrated in this place but is moving over all the helmet so it displaces the force so it s not on one area so i was like thinking like maybe like this big the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits it spreads to all the helmet so that s you versus less you spread all the force on your head so you have like less something that will transfer the motion yeah i like this idea but what i was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something cushiony on the outside so that it takes time for you to hit the helmet and once you hit the helmet the small cushiony so that it takes time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again and then hit you so kind of like an atmosphere yeah it will have like little layers it will probably have to make the helmet a little bit like bigger but not like don t make it like huge but have layers on there and then incorporate his idea when you re making waves so something like that first layer could help dissipate the force so we have cushiony against cushiony like boxers use and then they have the hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping so we have the cushiony part first so it s going to take time and i think that s what they use they put cushion on there so that it takes time for you to actually feel the force so that the force will be less and if you have cushion with cushion it s because you are increasing the time yeah because if you have two helmets that are hitting each other that are cushion and cushion it will take longer for them to hit each other and then the force will be decreased my question for matt is how big is the helmet oh the padding it s like thick it s kind of thick that s just the padding and then you have the helmet which is like that much more yeah it s like that thick how heavy is the helmet like when you re wearing it does it feeling like it s weighing you down yeah it takes time to get used to it and that day you re neck will hurt that s how heavy it is another version of like what we are trying to do i think it d also be cool maybe like helmet were like it was fitted to like the head and then it d have like inbetween kind of like a net structure which is a part of uh kind of like what he had but something that is hung i want to kind of imagine it like the bridges how they have like a whole bunch of little columns but just a whole bunch that is attached to the outside of the helmet i will draw it and i ll show you guys you had your hand up do you want to share while he yeah i was wondering since we re talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the type of brain damage that you can get just like an actual name like i heard concussion other injuries other names can you tell what a concussion is what is a concussion ask the group well a concussion is when it s when you your brain between your actual brain and your skull there is a liquid like spinal fluid is it and that s supposed to cushion your brain from touching the or hitting your skull but a concussion is when it s hitting and it s going back and forth i mean gradually it will go back to normal but that s my understanding of concussion and you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest areas of the impact so what part do you think is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain on your brain the sides what do the sides control well it wasn t like that i thinking like in the structure of the of the skull so the sides where the nerves enter like your optic nerves yeah so i think that s like less pain it s like a really big hit here can kill a man so i think that hit is worst you re saying the skull is thinnest right there yeah it s not as thick as the other parts it s thickest like right here what does your frontal lobe control so that s what kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most developed frontal lobe and then on the sides is more of your sensory stuff and then in the back is your actually your occipital lobe for your eyes is in the back a long with your movement your cerebellum so different spots that s why you have padding here and here and back here is to protect all sides of the brain so a concussion is just like your brain keeps vibrating basically after the blow so i like to think about it and i meant to bring this in and i apologize so if you have think about your tupperware and inside the tupperware you have an egg you just cracked a nice egg inside and then you shake it so imagine that egg is your brain and that tupperware is your skull so the harder you rattle it what s going to happen to the egg it will break it s gonna break right the yolk s going to break right i mean your brain doesn t really break but you can think that it s just kind of the movement because if you think about what does newton s first law say an object that s in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by outside force so if the brain if you get hit here which way is your brain going to go that way until it hits the skull and then it s going to thunk so that s what they call rattling your cage i was thinking of like when i play baseball when i swing the bat and i hit the ball and my hands keep like i can feel it inside and like even after a minute it will keep rattling so now take that and think about how that would okay so david can you uh explain what you have so we can this is kind of like the bridge idea that i had where like there s like different columns that go around like the frame so in this it would kind of be like the head goes right here and the helmet s right here and these would be like some kind of material that s bendable so when something hits it they would bend in so to absorb kind of the impact kind of like a cage in the racing cars like how racing cars have a cage inside of them just in case they roll over the cage still protects the person yeah kind of no but yeah kind of like that but these are like cushions yeah so they absorb the momentum so like a coil like for your bed the bed spring that when you jump up on it you rebound back so wouldn t that be more dangerous if it s elastic yeah it s elastic and when we did the little cars when it was elastic it completely transferred all of its momentum to the other car so when you get hit it will just like swing and then all the momentum will hit you instead of both of you sharing it so if you share it d probably be better but i don t know if that s because i was also thinking of mattresses a little sleep mattresses and how they talked about the coils and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger over here than over here and then they have the new ones now that are like foam the tempurpedic ones yeah so i was thinking also if you like spread out where the momentum goes saying if you spread out where it won t be in one certain area then you won t get hit really hard right here and if you get hit hard like over here it d probably be better than getting hit hard just right there yeah it will probably be less of a force so when they design like a helmet they ve got one piece thing where it s like your body their shoulder pads connected to their helmet so your body absorbs some of that too instead of just your head so that depends how you turn your head and would it be good if your body have you guys ever heard that people who are like drunk drivers they kind of walk away from a car crash and it s the passengers or the victims are the ones that get hurt the most so think about what s different between their body in motion and the other person s body in motion so they re looser right they re not tightening their muscles compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact we flex right just waiting for it and so by being more rigid your body doesn t move you re trying to fight against the motion so you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that because you it hurt your body more because you re trying to fight against what you re body is actually going to do instead of the other person who s just like really loose is moving with it so there s not as much impact well i ve been playing football and how you play like you want to win you hit someone you want to after that you re still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like i know what he is saying is like if you see someone about to collide with you you want to hit him back instead of yeah why is that related that to momentum because momentum is vector right so you have to think about the direction and of the way that things are moving so think back to when we were playing with different cars so you had the greater mass in one car going this way and had the smaller mass going this way right so what would you want to do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the raise his speed increase the speed right and so by knowing that you re going to get hit you re going to run a little faster so then what was the what is the ending result there so like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass mean like how do you think is like inelastic i don t know like so what s going to happen are they going to stay stuck together so it s elastic so it comes off right think about it like a rubber band an elastic rubber band you can stretch it so elastic is is saying something that s going to rebound whereas inelastic you re just rigid there is no motion i guess you should say i thought that was inelastic when you hit something it will both go off completely and elastic it will stick together and inelastics magnets,1.0
how do you know because my dad works oh okay see i want us to think about that because that was something that came up yesterday sometimes we think oh that s only stuff men do or that s only stuff women do but especially mechanics working on engines and stuff like that we think that s a man s job but you said your dad works with a lot of women and kyle your dad s a kind of a mechanic too and he works with a lot of women too so girls think about that kind of thing okay thank you very good all right now carter come up please carter all right carter tell us about the job works on people when they are injured firefighters work on burning equipment and carrying test hydrants and inspect businesses okay so your job is say it real loud so they can hear you a firefighter and a paramedic okay and what are the skills that that job uses math reading writing computer technology there it is be proactive begin with the end in mind first thing s first think win win synergize great okay so all of the seven habits right okay interesting who s next and are there women firefighters yes and paramedics absolutely good job carter okay taylor taylor green all right taylor tell us the job a machinist and tell us a little bit about what they do repair and turbine engines for helicopters and tanks helicopters and tanks and they use what math technology be proactive okay very good do you think women can do that kind of job yes absolutely okay so we said math technology are big ones there working on the helicopters tanks things like that okay next let s have lexi lexi wilson all right lexi all right tell us about your job furniture showroom manager i assist customers with furniture purchases inventory the furniture we have on hand update customers orders all right and we use what skills math science oh i wasn t watching you that s okay not so much science reading writing computer technology be proactive put first things first think win win and synergize okay now i m gonna ask you a hard question science the person with that job indicated they use science in a furniture showroom management position how do you think they use science maybe they make the furniture the materials maybe they use and stuff like that good good job all right thank you okay so we can see that all of the skills that we re learning in school right now especially technology skills computer skills reading math even science our parents are using those jobs uh skills in their jobs right now in real life so someday you re gonna be using exactly what you re doing right now in a job as well as our personal skills our seven habit skills being in charge of ourselves thinking about things ahead of time planning ahead putting first things first good job all right now we re gonna take our group cards and on the cards you have a job listed one of the jobs that you re looking at in your group and a skill that goes along with that job what i want you to do is as a group discuss how can we show the use of that skill in our job that we have okay so look at your cards figure out how you re gonna use the skill listed on the skill card and then we re gonna role model to the rest of the class the use of our skill and show how we use that skill in the job that s on that card okay so start discussing and then in a few minutes i m gonna call you back and we re gonna start showing the rest of the class our skills we re the paralegal we could do well for reading skills we could do filing or we could prepare bills for clients but to prepare bills for clients we d have to read you know who they are and then for filing we d have to read whose bill it was class when your children get ready for heading where they go down to gym for the program this morning we are right now in the process of calling kindergarten we re gonna get them to head down the hallway to the gym first and then we re going to have second grade come on down third grade fourth grade and fifth grade okay so payton is gonna lay on the floor and then i m gonna get to do a knee surgery on him first i ll like get a pencil pretend i m cutting the knee open and pulling it and then cutting the muscle and replacing the broken parts of the knee bone with like using our skills we can measure the wire right here and we could measure how long it could be for the house electricity circuits and we can measure how long the wire is and somebody could be in the house and we could measure how long the wire is so let s do the thing we did yesterday when you re laying on the floor and i m trying to put the breath back in you and then i ask carly what happened okay so you two are doing it do you think maybe a table and chairs and maybe a couch yeah a sofa and then you ll get over behind the table and everything and then i can say what day and what time and that s writing down what writing skills writing skills very good very good we re gonna show like you you would be like typing on the computer and you would be and i would come up and ask what you re doing and so the other people would know what you re doing on the computer i would come up and ask what you re doing and you would say i m making a blueprint like cause if we did use set up machines for production and we use synergize we d have to work together to do it and how do we do that miss kimberly yes ma am how do we act out setting up for productions setting up machines well since you re act you want to show synergizing now what does synergizing mean working together okay so you need to involve working together yeah okay and certainly with being a mechanic you re working on what machines machines and so what you wanna try to demonstrate is everybody working together to build a machine possibly that would be a good one i think all right we re going to go ahead and start our demonstrations so i m gonna ask morgan landon and abby s group to show us their skill and tell us what your job is tell us what s your job a paralegal a paralegal and your skill is reading okay let s see how they re using reading second grade and third grade please come on down to the gym thank you okay great that s good now what were they doing filing reading filing exactly very good good job okay let s have luke destiny payton and where do you guys wanna go up here all right tell us your job certified surgical tech wonderful and your skill put first

ll be josh alyssa and taylor g our job is maintenance mechanic,1.0
does that include slaves yes does that include women yes okay so how are we supposed to take uneducated people s opinions when they obviously don t know what s gonna happen because a lot of people in russia i mean if the russian s knew how to read they would write a song if they knew what was going on and they were smart enough they would obviously write a song about it i think john locke had one more thing to say is that right yes okay and to answer your question about the government the government was created to protect people s rights it wasn t created for you to abuse power and just do what you think you need to do they are only for them and it s not doing what it needs to do then yeah the people do have the right people aren t dead so obviously i m doing what i need to do and i m protecting them if that s all you care about then that would just be easy not to let people die obviously they re not having problems where their lives threatened we have all these like if you re wherever you live anyways wherever you live if your king or queen wasn t doing what they thought to protect you guys and you had all these invaders coming in then you could argue being mad at them because they re not protecting you and doing their job that s when you know they re upset plus you re saying that your people aren t educated but they re educated enough to know what their rights are and how they should be treated so i mean you can think you should be treated in a certain way but i could say i think i should be able to slide on this floor right now but i might not know if i slide on this floor right now i m gonna die but because i m not educated in that kind of way but your king or queen is educated in that kind of way so they re not gonna let you do stuff like that we re not asking for stuff like that we re asking for our natural rights i know that they what s the word the end result conclusion i know the conclusion of you guys getting your natural rights and the way that you guys are acting for them in a way i m gonna get you guys what you guys need to get your conclusion is gonna be a whole lot better than what you guys are hoping so what s the point of having your natural rights if you re going to abuse the law it doesn t mean you re going to abuse the law it just means that you re gonna be more cooperative towards the law you re attributed to a beggar if they don t give you your natural rights it s like a two way type thing if they give it to you then you re gonna be happy about it and you re gonna want to follow them and listen to them instead of trying to revolt and kick them out if they re not gonna give it to you alright so we say government is a good thing bad thing or kind of in between let s go around the room real quick what would you guys say i would say government is a positive thing because it stopped some starving and it keeps everything in place okay good we re in between because it s there to protect your rights but if they re not gonna be there to protect you then they shouldn t be there at all okay so it has to be done in the correct way government is a good thing any explanation why because if you don t have a government then you aren t organized and if you re not organized then you re like chickens would be in your home we think that philosophers they write what they feel about us and they don t do anything about it and they don t understand where we re coming from you philosophers are lucky men you write on paper and paper is patient unfortunate empress that i am i write on the susceptible skins of living beings meaning that they write on paper because they can put out they opinion like that but we have to be responsible for all the people in our country and we re trying to do what s best for them in your opinion frederick we think government is interesting because we need a government to be organized but government also does a lot of bad stuff we think the government is completely necessary along with religion because it brings unity to the people and i think the laws and religion kind of go hand in hand because i wouldn t consider myself a christian but others probably would because of certain stuff i write in books that s why they consider me as a heretic but the bible says thou shall not kill killing someone is also against the law thou shall not steal is also against the law i feel the government is good if it uses the right power basically for their rights and things as long as it should be there we feel it should be there but it needs to be used appropriately we believe sort of that the government is a positive if you didn t have a government as a base structure for your country if you didn t the government perhaps is a positive due to the fact that the government helps you if you need it to an extent i agree with catherine the great in the fact that it sort of really helps with the territory i ve been interviewed by many people and specifically saying to many people i ve said it that i m capable of saying whatever i want so my country is there and i get to do whatever i want if you were the king you d do whatever you want to theoretically alright voltaire pretty much the government is an abomination i mean there s way more bad and nasty leaders than there are good lawful public leaders that do good stuff too many leaders take advantage of their people in their kingdoms so i think they should just all go away start over with enlightened total what about slavery what do you think about slavery what do you people think about slavery what about slavery anybody have an opinion is slavery good bad or otherwise i wouldn t say slavery is a negative then again i wouldn t say that it s a bad thing either i guess you could say mostly slavery came from austria due to the fact that if you get in trouble with another country and they sand to the austria you re pretty much going to be a slave for the rest of your life you pretty much work for them you work for the pope himself and you work for the roman emperor voltaire i think slavery is a necessary evil a necessary evil well we disagree with because we see everyone as equals and think everyone should be treated equally and it s part of their natural rights such as freedom exactly that would be considered one of their natural rights rousseau serfs which were similar to slaves very good last comment there thomas hobbes i don t think we really have an opinion on slavery but if the king decided to have slavery in the country i think we should respect that and do it for the betterment of the country respect the authority of the king no piling up because that s what slavery is there for okay very good any last minute comments i think we re almost out of time for our salon discussion i heard a lot of good ideas does anybody have any last minute comments that they want to add yes frederick a lot of things that we have to say i didn t get three things of everybody s opinion all you guys are really self you re not sinners or anything for lack of better words and i wouldn t read them meaning i would probably do anything to get support from my people and i d do anything for my people like my dad would do anything for me he raised me well and slavery and natural rights and all that mumbo jumbo shouldn t be from you because you re not them you re not just as you re not voltaire and i m not thomas so you can t overrule anybody else it s not right very good excellent job ladies and gentlemen thank you for attending our little salon here hopefully we learned some new ideas and got to hear some other opinions of people throughout europe so let s give yourselves a little round of applause alright you are now done with the salon you can take your little parts if you want and put them up because you are no longer those people you are now you in modern day times back to modern day times but i do have some questions we are not done with our discussion but you are not longer your person you are back to being you we are not done and i m going to ask you your questions now please listen what was the purpose of a salon we ve talked about this from what you ve right here what was the purpose of a salon exchange ideas exchange ideas any other purposes sometimes like joseph did over there but to find out what people thought of you okay to find out different opinions okay maybe see something from a different side or viewpoint it was a devised to discuss music who gets painting time okay so it has an artistic point to it as well it was just another way for us to learn about taking notes and stuff like research on our person and then hearing what the other people thought but as far as back then is what we re thinking about oh back then oh yes you were right about what you said just to exchange ideas and go back until people like it would you say there were effective back then yes we haven t talked about results we kind of left off talking about these people and how they talked about things and came to the salon do you think this is going to be an effective method of discussing the conversations we were having with them over there like how they didn t think that we were listening to what the people were saying and how we were just gonna stay the way we were and stuff but actually they got to hear our thinking about moving to where we need to go it s gonna take them a little longer to get there okay do we have anything like salons today do we have salons today yes what happens at salons now right so it s not so much political all the time in exchanging ideas about government stuff but they re still kind of socialization and gossip going on is there anything that we have in place or anything in our society today which you can discuss opinions especially about government or problems that you might have in life um since salons don t really go with that but so if you have a problem with your country or with the government or with something that s going on we don t have a salon to go and meet like this and talk with people but is there anything that we do that or any other thing another way to voice your problem if your dissenting and you have a different agreement or a disagreement with the government or with anybody anything what can you do don t we have press conferences what do you mean representatives write letters write letters to who the government congress the government okay they also have environment issues and worldwide problems worldwide problems okay that s kind of similar where different people come and talk about their issues their problems and maybe how to solve them you kind of have different levels like if you have a problem with like if it s about the school you go to the school board okay president or people who are trying to be president they have the debates on tv okay good as far as being an average citizen what can you do say there s an issue with the world or an issue in our country or an issue in our city that we want to see fixed what can we do you think to maybe go about fixing that or trying to get that done protest protest is that allowed are we allowed to protest yes were you allowed to protest back then it depends on where you live at depends on where you live we have a different government now right back then it was monarchy now it s more of a democracy so what we re seeing here a little bit a little bit different method and a lot more opportunity there s a town like,1.0
so we go back remember this do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest okay what s happening is things are getting not broken up another example of that would be measure 16 to 17 you would not want to breathe at the end of 16 now i want to go back to 13 and i want you to do what we did yesterday where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties so what that does at 13 is it should da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daa da da da da da da da da da da da da dum okay it s kind of funny to do that on the bass drum so just play the regular part on the bass drum okay i can try to nah i d rather you not because it s going to muffle it s going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing try it at 13 everybody da da da da da da da working on accents one two and ready and go look at measure 15 da da daa da da da da what s happening is some of you are changing 15 to this tell me what s wrong with this anybody recognize what s wrong with that adrian you played four yeah i played four sixteenth notes and then i played a note on beat four it s got a one and two three e and up listen again here s the correct way oops wrong finger listen again try that measure 15 one and two and ready and go again more accent that last note s really short and it s really strong one two 15 and play now play it the way it s written but feel it the way you just played it that will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note one two ready and go and okay see how it places it very crisply let s go back to 13 play it break it down into the sixteenths da da da da da da da ready 13 we re going to go all the way through 20 one and two and ready and play and now i m going to get to what we are beginning to learn today i m going to go ahead and put my tie up here now is there anyone who can tell me what this is what is that daniel a dotted eighth note this is a dotted eighth note who can tell me what this note is sedekia one sixteenth note it is a sixteenth note so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot with that in mind can somebody tell me what the value of that note is cole it would last for like three beats three beats and then you would have a sixteenth note okay i think you re on the right track it would last for three of something but not three beats landon three fourths of a beat it would be three fourths of a beat so let s think about this remember an eighth note in 4 4 time gets half of a beat everybody what s half of a half one fourth one fourth so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat well that sounds a little bit complicated but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here so who can tell me what i would write for counts under this dotted eighth note raise your hand lydon would it be one e one e because that s the same as having three of both and jaylin what would go here a e okay so this is just another way of writing this let s do a measure of counting that ready and go and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and now i want all my first row to do that four times okay and go and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and second row ready and go and one e and a two and one e and a two,1.0
that they need to make some sort of a change like the turning point like there s a turning point there s some kind of change that needs to occur do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change no i think some no in fahrenheit 451 how some people were assuming that mildred already knew but she just didn t want to not like accept it but not be part of it she didn t want to be part of the change she just wanted to be in tune with society she never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point even when she had the opportunity she didn t right i think emotion plays a big role in that too because faber let fear get in the way of him doing something so he basically created that little earpiece thing so that somebody else could do it for him and he could watch over somebody that s actually doing it another person who s carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is beatty because although he had all of the knowledge much more knowledge than montag had about society and everything he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it then what s the point if he s not going to gain anything out of it do you think also because he has all that knowledge he wants to use it to have power since he knows all that he wants to manipulate keep them in control keep them in check and stuff no i don t think it s that he wants power i mean it s that he s seen the bad side of things and like all humans you don t like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it with education he knows it s good because it helps you think outside of the box and everything but it s bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything then you realize that there s genocides there s slavery there s wars there s too much negativity the government also doesn t want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go the more information they know the more possible ways they can use it against them i like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff because i guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people vulnerable vulnerable it s like if the people were the government s subordinates so it s not the government s people who they re protecting it s pretty much who they re in control of i kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing like in harrison and bridge around again you get to see the emotion or what george has to go through but yet he doesn t do anything about it harrison does it says right here his thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm it s showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head or whatever but harrison is the one doing the actions he s the one that wants to go against the government and george isn t so do you think their relationship and the correlation of george and harrison is just like montag and faber s where faber doesn t want to do anything because he didn t want to go to jail in the south george doesn t want to go to jail because he doesn t want to lighten his own way because he would get what was it seven years yeah for each sled that he takes out and harrison is actually doing stuff and montag isn t doing stuff so do you think that you need that person the one behind the scenes doing the stuff and then a person that s actually doing it or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill i think that you need people who are i think that you need people who are but i think that it s easier to so i think that way is better so you don t get in trouble i think the people that have the people in the front lines are always useful they are easier to camoflauge they are the ones with the real plans these people in the front don t usually come up with them yeah but you have the plans and then you don t do it but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don t know how to use it well not every body s that brave that s why you need to i think people need the support system like faber was montag s support system he had a plan don t let him tell you he sees walk away walk away i guess here s my question so in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow i want you to think our question is to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws right created by government i know i m asking you to respond with to what extent should citizens comply with these unfair laws but we re also talking about so who should act right so who should be the one to act out to lead to go against the government because we re looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out we re looking at people who have knowledge who have strength who are talented but they re not leaders and we re also looking at people who may not have those qualities they have the potential to have those qualities but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push so when we say to what extent should citizens comply do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices do you even think that s fair that it s a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole i want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we ve seen a group of people whether it is a whole group or just a couple of people who take charge who lead and impact change are there any examples that you can connect to that do you think that that s even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people i see it as a way every time there s a change or a law or something that affects a certain group of people it s never really based on the whole group of people like all citizens it s more of a target and when a certain group is attacked or targeted it makes others not really i don t want to say care but it doesn t really matter to them because they re not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that or yeah it s just basically it s that group of people who have to i guess express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right but i think it s necessary for a unit you probably need that one person who spreads the message and then i think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it s going to be your turn so here s my question because on your ap exam on your final exam for your argumentative essays you have to be able to generate your own examples so i know omar you ve got a very clear idea but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific and that s what you can discuss let s see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific you want to say hey let s look at this specific example where this actually happened any thoughts on that anything with slavery with frederick douglass and the abolitionists in the north they really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and i guess that s where civil disobedience comes from is the abolishment of slavery well the need to abolish slavery that it really wasn t really blacks or africans or whatever you called them back then wanting to be set free was people that weren t even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free and i think that s more important and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery they re not benefiting they re not getting negative from it so it s like you really think that it s wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation it s saying that it s wrong i want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that s going on right now because i guess maybe not a lot of you are aware but there s i don t know if you guys heard something about the green eye that recently that s in the past and i think that s very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but i guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in that kind of stops them and discourages them from to keep going so i guess that idea is i don t know it s kind of opressive because they re trying to maintain you in that little it s just marginalizing you and yeah i think it needs more support so i want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests right people were really protesting that and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against right and when we look at the questions to what extent should we comply with unfair laws if that is an unfair piece of legislation to what extent do you then choose to protest how far would you be willing to take it because we talked about this this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion like look at harrison right dancing on stage as a ballerina doesn t really seem all that tough right but for him he was taking a big stance right not about borderline violence right i want you to look at what thoreau did he didn t pay his taxes he wanted to go to jail he was happy there he was like don t bail me out had nothing to do with violence right you hear a lot of people protesting you know issues regarding the dream act but to what extent should they comply with the laws do you use violence do you even take it there do you use more creative forms of protesting i want you to consider how far do you take it how far do you show your protest what is acceptable and where do you draw the line good reaction lots of reaction let s hear from people we haven t heard from i want you to go back and think about your goals that you set i m hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions chose goals that might push you to speak up so let s hear from a few folks that we haven t heard from yet and share the air time any volunteer jesus what do you think like omar said like the dream act has an ill affect on a lot of people it doesn t really affect me but i know a lot of friends that it is affecting it s not really fair that it really didn t pass but when we want to try to push something like julian said for slavery it didn t really take it took such a long time for them to really get the rights there was the abolishment there was frederick douglass during that time but as time went then came martin luther king who was the center person who started the really big move for african americans to realize their own rights he lead the protests marches if you gather groups of people over time if you speak up with your voice people will hear even people like african americans they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal there should be rights and everyone no matter what color you are so for latinos like us for the it s such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights but the dream that was once dead but even though it didn t pass people should not be put down like aw it didn t pass so they ll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights cause if we stay together anything can happen if we stay together as one something will happen i am hearing two things and we ll get back to stephanie really quickly i think she s just itching to get in this conversation i m hearing two things one that it takes a collective group effort it s not just one person but it needs to be many people involved as many people involved and i m also hearing that it takes a lot of time so those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws that s kind of like right now that it s kind of more modern because you think so no no no i want you take this idea that omar brought this idea of mental slavery of oppression of our intellect our intelligence is that something that you think is just recent is that something that s been happening over time i want you to think about that and see we might isolate one part of the problem but i want you to think on a broader scale is it really just one isolated event or is this one in a stream of events stephanie you had something that you were yeah all of them were in the governement and i was thinking of the movie milk how they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in california and to be heard which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way but he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard one part in the movie that i ll always remember is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he s gay and all of that but he just hangs up but yet he does it for him most likely because he wants people like that to be heard and that s kind of what my connection is i think another historical event besides the slavery and what you just said is the nine eleven i think it s the short term one it took actually really quick the terrorists going up there it just took one simple idea to tell them oh let s just go,1.0

please freeze for a moment gentlemen what did you think about your performance i wouldn t say terrible but were you accurately on pitch all of you no no like as soon as the ladies came in you were like whoo and then you forgot what you were singing okay so don t let them distract you they re trying they re trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off but hold firm men hold firm to your position all right let s try it again here we go sing noel sing noel noel noel lock it in sing noel sing noel noel noel two parts sing noel sing noel noel noel sing noel sing noel noel noel together sing we all noel the support sing we all noel two parts sing we all noel sing we all noel back to the beginning sing noel sing noel noel noel end song all right if you were going to give yourself a grade what would you give it alison as a class like out of a s and b s and c s yep i would give an a minus okay and why the minus what do you think we think need to improve the pitch was kind of off at some parts okay so there was maybe some pitch issues what about energy level it was okay but this but one of the things about african music is it is something that is like felt in their soul okay it is traditionally when you listen i mean they are just letting it you know when we see any of the performances or listen to any of the cds we ve listened to it s just very gut felt i feel like you re sing noel sing noel noel noel so this is so pretty yes we want sing noel sing noel noel noel especially on that sing we all noel that s me we re singing it s like you re telling people we are singing not sing i think we all noel okay so let s make sure that we re right there on that one more time see if you can get a little more weight to your sound i don t mean make it flat i just mean with more confidence more security more support okay here we go sing noel sing noel noel noel awesome sing noel sing noel noel noel two part sing noel sing noel noel noel sing noel sing noel noel noel support this sing we all noel sing we all noel sing we all noel sing we all noel sing noel sing noel noel noel good and stop there so you get the idea that was awesome did you hear the difference yeah awesome i love that you challenged yourselves you pushed yourselves there it s hot those notes are kind of high i know that and you just pushed right through it so good job let s review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time so i m going to come here so we can do our body percussion real quick we are going to start with our bass part ladies and gentlemen we are not going to use these right now because traditional african music is by rote meaning you learn it by hearing you learn it by doing if you are a visual learner these are our music stands by the instruments so this will help you and you know i want everyone to be successful so you use the tools that will help you be successful you be an independent learner where you decide if this is what you need grab a music stand okay if you don t you don t need it okay so there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick okay so basses first let s all kind of scoot over this way so bass section first we have starting with your left hand sing oh sing oh sing noel sing oh sing oh sing noel and you have that crossover sing oh sing oh sing noel everybody feel comfortable with that any questions you look good you look like you have it all right then we have the xylophones this one s a tricky one so we have for that part let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time so we have sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it okay so the trickiest part is how many g s all right so remember we have low c and high c so you have c c c c c c and there s four gs over that syncopated rhythm g g g g f e d okay so it s kind of like one two three down the ladder you go okay so let s try that c c c c c c g g g g f e d c c c c c c g g g g f e d got it got the idea all right then we go on to the glockenspiels and for that one we can just clap that rhythm because i think on the instruments it will be easier to see to show because they re so obviously a little so it s not really like that so here we go it goes sing oh yes sing noel noel sing oh yes sing noel noel sing oh yes sing noel noel okay got the idea for that rhythm so i will come over and help that section and some of you may remember that from last time then we have our percussion section okay we have first the conga drum a real quick review on conga drum playing everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you if we can kind of spin back here so i can show you when you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit and scoot over that way there we go so when you play conga drum you actually are going to hold it in between your legs and put your feet around the base and you re going to tip it out from you so that that way the sound can come out but you also have the correct play style remember pat on the ends when you re playing and those are in you can pat this on your lap as well right now practice on your fingers okay so here s on this practice with a good technique right now ready go this is the part of the conga drum all right you ve got the idea and that goes over and over each measure then we have the log drum and the log drum and again the parts are right here on the stand if you need them you re going to have one side you re going to play sing so basically and it doesn t matter with those sing noel sing noel sing noel okay so you can clap that real quick sing noel sing noel sing noel sing okay see how it fits hello welcome thank you very much all right so next we are going to have this part which is traditional african bell and this one you have rest rest rest noel sorry hi to low so it s rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel rest can you snap it noel rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel and you can try it rest rest rest hi and fast noel rest get them up noel rest rest rest noel yes ladies and gentleman i m always spot checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we re doing this it s really important that i see that participation because then when we go to pick parts i m looking to see who has it yes there s choice but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing okay so let s try it again ready go rest rest rest rest rest rest rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel you got it and then i love these shakers you are the pulse you are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song so it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together so again really important we might add in some other more african instruments they re kind of loud so we ll see if you can get the correct sound so what i d like you to do now do you have any question all right if you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time i would challenge you to maybe pick a different one okay if you were still working on it you re welcome to stay there but without any payoffs so just kind of selection i would like you all to go and pick an instrument part remember we have glockenspiels basses xylophones and percussion so open two glockenspiels open and a bunch of xylophones open who was there first who was there first between you and ellen i was here you were there okay so if you want to join the glockenspiels you can do that you can go to xylophones oh nobody s up to the challenge all right once you get there you can start practicing all right hold up everybody all right thank you since we re trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually if you have the green mallets would you especially for you guys switch them out with the felt mallets instead so here s a set well you need those for that as well so we have one there should be another one in there oh here right here nope those are green you don t want those oh here s another one right here here here you go here s a set that s awesome thank you because that s just going to make it a lot softer and not quite as angry sounding all right so let s listen to each part so you can know what you re listening for remember when you are playing in an ensemble like this if you can t hear the other parts what does that tell you you re playing too loud yes you re playing too loud and remember again texture is everything we want to be able to pull out the different parts so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that but for right now let s make sure that we can keep it soft okay it s not a competition all right no one s going to win it s the whole class that we re trying to do this together so if we hear bass part first and let s go ahead and add at least shaker for right now and then we ll build in one or two sections one two ready go okay time out so you re listening for the beat she s watching me instead of the basses right because you re doing their work a little bit and you need to keep it nice and steady what happened we ended up with three different tempos did you hear that one two ready go okay pretty good and then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are okay one thing that will help is adding the singing to it okay,1.0
i see lots of different levels of tennis i see some balancing levels blake why do you choose to balance this who wants to share keeping that ball controlled back to back catching placement find a partner and standing with equipment on the ground i ve got two groups ready equipment s on the ground you re looking for somebody you may have not worked with already you should have found a partner if not you guys will start thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground lost and found lost and found always come to the start very good when i say go you re going to turn to your partner i want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity what i have on the board over here and i also have it on my screen lifetime activity what does it mean to have a lifetime activity what does the word lifetime mean go bryan soccer baseball maybe not soccer maybe one of those yeah maybe it could be yeah soccer volleyball yeah volleyball and five four three two and one my partner and i zachary had some really good examples of what lifetime means so i m gonna use his zachary said that lifetime means you do it now as a third grader but we could do it later in life as an adult raise your hand if that s what you and your partner kinda said it s something you should be able to do later in life very good and then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life zachary said two cool ones tennis anybody else say tennis awesome pat yourself on the back and he also said bowling and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader and later in life is that they re pretty good on your body you can still do em they re not gonna injure your body too much it s gonna make you strong and healthy we have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out we ve talked about aerobic capacity and tennis will make your heart beat faster you have to find something that s gonna make the heart beat faster so now turn to your partner talk about what you re gonna choose to make your heart beat faster go and five four three two one pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity that you re gonna choose nice job when i say go you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face off position so this is where my partner and i came and we put our equipment down then we ll turn and look at the board ready go looking for an open spot with a partner thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly now we re transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges so far we ve worked by ourselves to be responsible learners brian are you looking for your partner he s right here so now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners on the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday zachary and ms rock will show you an example of what you could practice we re gonna actually skip this level today but you could choose it if you said hey you know what let s go back to this other level so zachary and ms rock both have our rackets we re gonna practice underhand striking keep up raise your hand if you remember that awesome alright here it is i tick step tock and he s gonna strike back or he can catch it and then i m gonna keep striking we re gonna keep our paddles low go ahead alright i m gonna wait til it gets low so i can strike he s gonna also wait til it gets low to strike keeping that paddle low we re trying to keep it up as long as we can awesome so that was the first level striking keep up with the balloon now we re gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner super duper cool it looks like this only one person will need a bean bag since i m closest to the wall i m the person to have the bean bag first i m going to be the underhand thrower zachary go ahead and pick up your racket create a flat surface i m going to underhand throw he s going to catch it on his racket take a step tock good try you might have to reach out and get under it now he s gonna leave it on his racket and he s gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands go ahead take a step tock i catch alright he needs to have three tries with the racket then it s my turn to have three tries with the racket thumbs up if you understand down if you got a question alright person closest to the wall you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag bring it back and place it in your racket go quickly quickly and five four three two one you should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket raise your hand if you have a question so partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up you re the tosser first with your hands you only need the beanbag you only have the beanbag grab your place on your side thank you christopher for being safe we re gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly we re gonna see how far we get we re gonna be responsible if the beanbag is not working so well you can go back to a balloon balloon alright let s practice go one catching on their racket one catching on their hand i hear good communication with a partner you have to help each other one person is underhand throwing one person is catching awesome if you haven t switched jobs go ahead and switch jobs at this time if you haven t switched jobs see how many good catches you can get give yourself a point for each catch hands or racket are you using the opposite foot to step back with both partners pick up rackets both partners pick up rackets look at the board now you re gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge count how many you can get go there you go zach excellent one and freeze alright from here i m going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners we have learned to use a bean bag with a partner we re gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball and a large tennis trainer both of these offer different challenges the first one is a foam ball as you can see on the screen they now have a foam ball zachary picks up his racket we are doing an underhand strike back and forth but like we did with the tennis ball we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to so zachary do you think if i tossed this to you you could try catching it alright let s see nice he had to figure out how to keep that balance on here he s gonna do the same thing back to me this is just working on looking for that ball getting our feet to it and keeping a flat surface we can do the catching with the ball now we re ready for the tap offs remember what we did with the balloon we re gonna try to keep the foam ball up this is what it looks like tap tap good try it went away a little bit stop it we come back i tick step tock good we re keeping a flat surface coming back slanted out the lower the racket the better control we will have i want the racket to stay at a slant to partner can you say that slant to partner so that s the foam ball challenge some of you may just stay with the foam ball but if you re like i wanna challenge myself and my partner i say zachary we can now use the tennis trainer and it s going to bounce strike bounce strike the bouncing is gonna bounce here before i hit it then it will bounce in the middle then my partner will strike okay ready zachary so it s a bounce strike bounce strike excellent and i would come back and start it over again if i need to bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike catch when needed were we controlled yeah when it got out of control we caught it so from here on out you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with bean bag what came next foam ball and then tennis trainer excellent see how far you get with the partner you re working with this uses communication and cooperation say that communication and cooperation excellent this is how it would look zachary what piece of equipment would you like for us to use or you think you re ready the the foam ball or the balloon what did you say the end one the end he said he wanted to use the tennis trainer w for wilson it s the brand i said oh you know what zachary i don t feel like i m ready for this one can we go back to a foam ball first and he said yes i m all phew thank you we just had communication and cooperation i know that i can practice with this one for a little longer i ll probably be ready for the challenge alright ready go are you able to keep your paddles low keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled are you using an underhand strike alright ready zachary bounce strike bounce strike let it bounce one time bounce strike bounce strike good bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike now i m going to give you a challenge so i can go around the room and see if anyone needs help you ll just work on tap ups you can use any equipment that you need okay tap ups or tap downs if you and your partner need a little help you can always raise your hand and i can come over try to review those cues with you underhand strike okay bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike okay say that bounce strike okay and if it s not working then you and your partner need to say we need to go back to the be responsible try it again though bounce strike bounce strike ooh this is where aiyah did she step with her opposite foot did you step when you strike no so it s key to step when you strike you gotta step try it again keeping those paddles low if you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot that s a reflection you should say ooh we a need help or b let s go to a different level responsible word i hear which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with and freeze equipment should be back on our rackets now i see students at all different levels so that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class which is excellent but now we re gonna see if you can switch it up a bit and give yourself a challenge you should be able to work with anybody so what i m gonna have you do is let s see here ellie ellie is gonna step over here come jogging down all the way down to where zachary is yay ellie ellie is gonna slide down one and that s gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner where you going very good zachary and then you go one down yep there you go now wave to your new partner excellent same thing here harrison come on down and slide on down wave to your new partner now you all of a sudden have to have more communication because you don t know where this partner is at ready go talk which one are you gonna do,1.0
welcome to our kindergarten classroom the library is the heart of our room where books are labeled and sorted by genre and reading level to facilitate student self selection this is also where we display author studies current student work and student made literacy charts this is where we have our writing center more level texts classroom volunteer supplies and a lending library math work is on display and student portfolios are organized and easily accessible we have a few tables to facilitate guided instruction and small group learning our schedule and calendar are housed in this part of the room and we have a message board which is portable and used for modeled and interactive reading and writing our learning center s chart organizes student movement around the classroom and our word wall houses high frequency words and rich tier 2 vocabulary words but on the morning of the fair the little calf was nowhere to be found she had wandered down to mud pond by the cornfield to cool off when she waded into the muddy water her feet sank with every step she sank deeper and deeper and deeper the little calf was stuck in mud pond get the hands get the helpers the farmer shouted when he saw her all the farm hands came running with their ropes but the more they tugged the more stuck the calf got get the big yellow tractor the farmer shouted he can save her but the big tractor just scared the little calf she sank deeper and deeper and nearby farmers began to gather around readers i think we ve come to our problem in the story i think the characters otis and the calf have a big problem talk to your partner and see if you can figure out what the problem is readers i heard a lot of good ideas i heard a lot of good discussion miami what s the problem who sank into the mud the baby cow it s called a calf oh my goodness readers i heard everybody s discussions you guys were all talking about the big problem the calf is stuck in the mud help me write that in the problem box here we go the calf is stuck in the mud that s our problem the calf is stuck in the mud let s see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story let s see how they re feeling now it tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions call fire chief douglas and the fire truck the farmer shouted they can save our little calf but the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper the farmer was fit to be tied if the farm hands and the big tractor and even fire chief douglas and his fire truck couldn t save the little calf who could oh my goodness look at everybody what effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community how is everybody feeling i like amir s raised hand how is everybody feeling amir they feel sad sad i heard you say another good word that started with w worried worried they re sad they re worried how else are they feeling sad worried scared scared scary what if they can t get her out scary call a lot of people yeah they re in panic mode they re trying to call everyone they re panicked frightened afraid afraid worried worried so so worried so so worried they might call the other tractor the big tractor can t get her out he already tried wait kanye were you talking about the other tractor the red one oh they might call otis maybe otis could help that might be a good solution to the problem let s see what they do let s find out suddenly the little calf s ears perked up over the hum of the growling crowd there came a faint sound in the distance a soft rhythmic purr put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck the crowd turned and looked you hear the word chuck who is coming otis otis good let s see what happens the sound became louder put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck let s all make otis sound put put puttity chuck put put put chuck put put puttity chuck all at once otis put puffed from around the barn he turned and he headed straight for mud pond otis put puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters edge the calf heard her friend s puttering purr and bawled it was almost like hello she s crying out to otis yeah she bawled to the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd otis slowly began to circle the pond he circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned never taking her eye off her friend it looks like they might be solving their problem with each ring otis made around mud pond the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own the two friends had found each other again it looks like we found a solution to our problem talk to your partner about how they found a solution how did they solve their problem i heard a lot of good discussion how did they solve their problem you guys i heard everybody talking about it so jabrielle how did they solve their problem what was the solution who came and got her out of the mud i heard you tell isaiah otis otis ramaya how did otis get her out of the mud just like jabrielle said he rided around the mud oh i don t know if you can hear ramaya she said otis rode around mud pond and got the calf out of the mud help me write that otis rode around mud pond it was called mud pond otis rode around mud pond and he got the calf out of the mud that s the solution now how is everybody feeling what effect is this having how do they feel now that they have their problem solved nijyah excited excited miami happy sherod glad glad edward yeah they re feeling great they re reunited their family is back together zion how do you feel when you solve your problem they are a little exhausted aren t they that was a lot of work ismail they re feeling okay they re feeling relieved relieved wow great job let s see how the story ends readers you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story it s really helping us comprehend the story better we re understanding it really well otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went following them into town it looked like a happy parade no one needed a fancy no one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf otis was a special tractor and the two of them were special friends from that day on the farmer discovered that with otis puttering purr beside the chicken coop his chickens laid more eggs at milking time with otis gentle chuck nearby his cow produced more milk and on occasion otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields but often at the end of the day otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved,1.0
scientist number two i want to know what your question is what is your variable that you re isolating and what are you measuring you guys ready okay so table two or table one our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes even after they ve been rinsed and our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used and the dependent variable is how they changed from before when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them cool and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain tomorrow we also were planning on taking pictures from before and after so we could like compare those so you may want to do a scale like marley did with the intensity of her hair dye as well okay but get it set up today make it really controlled with all your measurements and just change the type of oil alright scientists do you have any our experiment is we re going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges okay using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water i don t know i read your document i don t know what the positively charged particles you are but did you work it out okay so what s your question then our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum okay does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls them coming together scum balls okay good table three what s your question um how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water like using what we re going to use mainly olive oil and toilet paper okay perfect and testing the independent variable is testing how long we re going to stir how long it takes to make scum and then our dependent variable we re going to take the observations of time okay so the question is how long does it take to form scum balls independent variable is the stir time and the dependent variable is the how long it takes how long it takes to do it uh huh what are you going to measure though we re going to actually try to measure the surface area of the cool so you re going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time okay that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot okay table four what s your question how does temperature affect the oil and water how does temperature affect the oil and water awesome and we re trying to figure out how it will separate how can you separate it what are you changing in the experiment we re changing we re going to use regular temperature and put it on a bunsen burner and put it in the freezer cool and you re more than welcome to use the freezer in the back good idea alright table five what s your question does heat affect the scum ball does heat affect the scum ball and our independent s going to be amount of scum and the amount of water and the dependent s going to be heat okay so your independent now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever so your independent is really going to be temperature so i feel like you have two independent variables why don t you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate is it the amount of water and the amount of scum or is it temperature okay we were going to change the temperature then keep the amount of water and the scum constant because you can t do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures it means you re testing for two different things while you could do that it s two experiments and we don t have time today so just one experiment alright table six so our central question is is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes okay and our independent variable was the amount of oil and the dependent was the shape okay so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes independent variable is the amount of oil or scum dependent variable is the shapes while i m over here i just want to draw your attention to the back of the room that is the waste beaker which has scum on top of it right now it s every kind of oil that copper used yesterday so if you want pre made scum i encourage you to use copper s waste from yesterday so the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water but the top portion of it is just that less dense oily scum okay alright table seven what s your question it s can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter okay so we re trying two different types of oil and we re going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container okay and you may need to use two of the same identical filters so just make sure you re really consistent with your measurements between those two filters good alright i m excited about their project because copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting so check back in with this group later on if you want to see what s going on with the filters and table eight what s your central question does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water does oil collect the most what does oil collect the most of each thing oh the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water okay so you re going to look and see what it attracts and what are some of the materials you re going to use dirt sand and pebbles dirt sand and pebbles awesome so your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract how are you going to measure those results mass mass okay cool you may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass if you get too big it won t measure on our balances which brings me to my next topic which is safety talk conservation of materials did you guys get a lecture yet no because sam is too busy with her why don t you go over there and see what they re doing go talk to her thank you alright lady scientists what s going on we re like i thought that we didn t need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn t have enough time so we just did the small amount and then the larger amount okay now that we did the middle speed we re actually seeing a lot different stuff because the balls are actually coming together that underneath and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top okay and this is thicker than that one okay let me get another group over here because they re also trying to form a scum ball and i d like them to see your results terrence and catherine and maddy can you guys pause and come and check out this group s experiment i don t see scum it makes me mad ooh this is so cool why does it look like that i want it to look like that come on over these guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls can you guys talk about what s your independent variable what are you changing we re just changing the different speeds okay and yasmine what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three the dirt oil and the water okay and they used the black potting soil dirt is it the peat moss in the plastic bag that s peat moss okay good and taylor it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom what s that don t know can you guys fill her in toilet paper toilet paper which makes sense because there s a lot of toilet paper over there okay and so far your results have been they ve just done the high speed and the low speed right and they re like oh it s the same nothing happened nothing happened right they came back today and this is the medium speed and what s going on a lot of dirt balls are actually coming down and forming together because they were all little pieces of dirt and now they re making big globs of dirt and that s weird so does time sitting overnight have anything to do with it that s what we talked about with these two actually this one because and this one too because we didn t see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one and then this one i just noticed that it s actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil okay are the highs and the lows working the speeds yet have you tried to re run the highs and the lows today no re run the highs and lows you have a good seven six minutes see if they start to form clump balls not sure if you can use this one can i go get a funnel sure there s one on the table i am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not if you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything or you could leave it how it is it s your choice got about seven minutes okay thank you yes cool hey you guys have some diesel fuel on your table any information research observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome the three of you all together alright so we got 97 no 47 94 for all of them okay let me put the camera on you four ready let s talk about it is that okay okay so you isolated your variable different types of oil you made everything the same same size same amount of water same amount of soap time soaking everything was super controlled right okay and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board yeah it was 47 94 like it jumped between them two numbers constantly none of them like consistent so it was consistent alright so any initial conclusions yes i said that since all the things were like a darker color and the oils were kind of close i guess in like how they felt and what color they were i guess that maybe if we used a white shirt maybe there would ve been a difference because it would ve soiled it more do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric yes yes okay alright let me hear your conclusions and then i m going to this one that had water on it is different looking than this one like the material looks more like like dry or something right so there s some qualitative difference i know that this one needs to be flipped over because then it s the same side of the fabric okay so water that one s whiter lighter okay so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking and your control this one is darker your control was the same as all of them the 47 94 okay and you any conclusions yet um i don t know i kind of think the sand thing is sand because i know the one we put on the paper like it went all the way down to 40 something so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was okay and lauren what was your central question my central question the central question of your experiment oh it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there how much of it was still there okay or if it would affect the fabrics differently okay but your light probe is saying no they re all the same so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever should i take that as data i think you should take it as data yeah and it s okay you addressed your question which was how does oil affect it different among shirts in your case with the soap maybe not at all differently i d like you to try one more thing involving paper towels and what you re going to do is you re going to see you re going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there s any oil that s absorbed on the paper towels okay so that can be one other way to take data to see if there s still any oil still stuck in the shirts okay okay goggles on goggles on goggles on what s the highest temperature we could put it at are you guys boiling you can put it all the way up you just have to be really cautious get your hot hands out the big glove alright heather s group i m coming over to you guys ready okay what s going on over here we put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt okay ooh salt when i was a waitress we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out maybe you could put a second wait that s kind of like clay i was going to say flour because that s what we do if i spill what do you notice it s starting to kind of clump when we had the clay it was really really clumpy but then it it the uh yeah like the clay just clumped and then we had to get before and that didn t really make a difference it just sat at the bottom my hands are sticky oh thank you while you re here do you remember the charge of the particles of clay positive or negative negative okay so negatively charged particles and now you ve added sodium chloride which dissolves in water you ve got an a plus positive cl minus negative and you re clearly getting a scum ball no what happens when you turn it off it just all settles at the top when we put clay in there for the first time it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top but nothing of the magnitude so that motion really helps it to stay together yeah that s what we did we put it at 500 rpms first and then we dialed it back down to 100 let s apply this to the water treatment plant was there motion at the water treatment plant yes was there clay in the water probably from where from the sediment on the bottom of the schuylkill from the sediment on the river now remember the stuff that s going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home so it hasn t had a chance to go in the schuylkill river yet okay would there be any clay in the homes not in the homes no not in the homes not in anything flushed down the toilet yeah so yeah there could be some like clay like sediment sand particles going through or at the very least we could say that there s probably some negatively charged particles going through some kind of silicates shall we throw away the fabric sure who knows what s in feces right alright so what i think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form have you talked about cece s experiment yet no go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed also matt ian s sorry catherine s station is using sand specifically and i forget what the other material is it looks like peat moss and they re having no success so go ahead and do a little quick walk around and clean up motion can you let them give them a 10 second overview yeah and then go taylor pull it together you ll be okay you re good okay did you get any scum no we didn t we just got into lumps the fastest way we got a layer and then everything the soil settled on the bottom and then for the middle speed it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in clean up clean up,1.0
you re going to test and be coming up here for materials okay go you just follow the lines if no if the lines if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper the termites will follow the lines we should draw like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow and we ll make it like this well it s not going to be on a circle it can be like this and see if they ll follow that circle yeah would that be a good may i bother you with this i m just covering them up what are you saying yeah well beside this one if termites we ll place on a red piece on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines then the termites will follow the lines in the circle okay so you re going to use the color red line again what color paper would you use white white paper yeah and i think since we ve already used colored paper i think that s a result of that well again you could do yours and yours and tie them together use different colored papers so what s the point of your test that depending on the colored paper we ll determine what the termites sight can do i would think it s the color of the line because that s what they re following so you think they re following the color of the line yes yeah but when they went to the end of the white paper they went to the black and they came right back well no that s because they knew what it was that s because i like kept hitting them back okay so you re kind of going along with the idea of color how could you prove that color was that color effects their you draw a bunch of different circles draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size but of different colors and see which one they go to i like that nice okay on a white piece of paper yeah again i ve got colored paper the more tests you do the more accurate your results would be all right so let s do the same test but on two different types of paper so if termites are placed on a white piece of paper put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out no that down good and there you go so what were we thinking about testing um putting tables in line using different color and to see if we re not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around oh very nice yeah because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down they followed it down tricky okay they went it s true so they didn t follow this part yeah because it curves no because they we drew the circle they go like then they curve and go down and they came here and went back up they all followed hmm interesting thank you four you ve got about two more about a minute and a half actually what are we thinking i m going to go ahead and cover these up we were planning on doing um like we think they re attracted to the ink and i m going to test it with like a marker a pen and a crayon okay to see if like if they follow the ink better than the other ones nice would you use the same color of ink yeah because it would be the control there you go very nice um what color paper are you going to use should we use regular white i would say white yeah all right good okay sounds good where are your termites stop playing with them and we re going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out what were you guys thinking about testing mainly if they are going to follow the red line then they must be attracted to red they must be attracted to what red red okay so how could you test that they are just attracted to red we re going to make two large circles two large circles and some other lines and some other lines but what are you testing again if they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red okay so you re talking about the color red um would you use so you tell me what you re going to set up i m trying to follow probably just a black one and a red one lines or circles circles circles okay all right yeah basically just for fun okay okay just for fun all right um you should be collecting materials if pens and things aren t working let me know dude get the line what happened to your situations well we put tape over this and now it doesn t follow it over here i think they like the color red none of them are following any of these lines how could you continue to test that they like the color red put more red over here i mean we also put the tape there and it doesn t like the tape it gets confused and we have the red paper and it didn t follow the black lines or the pencil yeah that s what i mean none of them here are even doing anything they get tired and just start standing there twitching do you need some new ones no there are still pretty lively yeah so what are some of the conclusions that you re thinking oh terrance be sweet ah be sweet ah white on red they only like that also they only follow that type of pen they don t follow any other type of pen or pencil um they don t necessarily have an affiliation to red okay how do you know that cause they walked off the red paper okay they walked off the red paper so you threw that one out how could you continue to say that they like that particular pen and not having to do red we tried black pen we haven t tried another color on white yet see look it stopped at the tape it s confused at the tape no neal what i asked you is that a pen or a marker it s a pen it s a pen oh he s following the other we drew it on the other side we drew a circle on the other side it looked like he was following it is it something inside of them no like what the ink s made out of how could you test that using the red pen on this okay taking two different pens go grab some more that s a good idea red color pen red color pencil you killed the ant gentlemen be nice to your termites oh oh wait wait here neal let s get all right group here s a red pen colored pencil oh look that one s alive okay now then so what are you saying is going on they re still following the red one yeah they re still following the red pen so it s not necessarily an affiliation to the color red so it is something inside the ink so how can you test if it s something inside the ink i just got the other colored pencil take another red pen go grab some it s right there that s a pencil it s the color red look stick with the no you just threw out the idea that it s red stick with the color stick with the pen idea we need a pen like this no i think we have the exact same pen no no the blue one like this they have a blue one like that go see there s blue pens up there hey can we borrow a red pen i meant blue you know what i meant bam it s a different type of pen it s all right different type of pen but it s blue now did you get a blue one no i just got red ones i got bundles nice now they re going to follow it now i thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen i think it s that pen i ve got the same pen they re still the red i think they are okay try that one there s a hole there by the way if you press through it it will break go are you going to make it intercept the line yeah i m going to oh look he s following the little one maybe it likes circles wait wait i still think it s something inside the ink draw a square see if it follows a square so that would be able you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square so draw a square see what happens yeah draw a square i ve got another black pen i have all these pens why not draw the square inside of there inscribe the square in the circle terms terminology you re a professor now oh it s following it it is the pen curves are easier it didn t know where the line was okay five four um we drew different lines in the different types of pens markers colored pencils did you do it all on the same page or on different pages on different colored pages why would you do it on different colored pages ah to make sure the tests varied okay did you use the same color of ink on each page describe to me your experiment web the whole group can chime in too um like we drew like a black circle on a black sheet of paper okay to see if they could only like please don t be rude black circle on a black sheet of paper keep going what else and that didn t work they could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that christian came up with that take a white piece of paper and we drew like every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles none of the other colors what were the blue and the red circles drawn with i believe different types of stuff mainly pen though and this was all on one sheet of paper well we tried it on different sheets too okay that s what started us off okay um did you have it all on one sheet at first yeah okay what did you realize was wrong with that they were pretty much getting confused as in we re going to have issues with what maintaining a control a control good only one independent variable nice um nick s group how did you go through the indentation we drew several circles using each of the utensils and then i think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of if they weren t in the middle sort of eating off of the wood or like just exploring around they were following the pen okay um your indentation line did you draw that with just pens different types of pens did you draw it with markers did you draw it with a paper clip we just used the same color but we used different things like we used pens vis a vis colored pencils stuff like that okay and what was your conclusion with that they followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation because they came the termites into that line because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop and i figured oh well they must be blind because they can t see that there s a drop there interesting point why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation instead of a pen because it wouldn t have shown a color but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen okay so any components within that pen color chemicals type of pen whatever if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation you would have been able to do what pen verses paper clip pen would have looked i think it would have looked the paper clip would have looked deeper but the thing is like would it prove if you had it or not had what or not if they followed the dent or not not just like the color or the like smell or whatever very good very good so by using the paper clip to create the indentation they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent maybe the scent from the pen the chemical from the pen that left the indent by doing the paper clip just by itself we would have been able to say okay that obviously doesn t leave any chemicals it doesn t leave any color and if they re following that indentation we know that that s what they are drawn too okay carly your group had an interesting set up um we well we kind of did two all right but the first one we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with like white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper and that didn t really work so we did the other one and um with like the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper and they only went on the red pen one okay what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described as in something that might have thrown off the results paper i don t know well notice in one of the experiments you used a what to create the circle the pen okay you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what paper but you used a oh white yeah you used a white colored pencil so by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil what are those two things now added on what variables added on variables okay for one you re using pen and pencil another you re using colors so how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables gentlemen calm down we could have used colored pencils the whole time okay could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time good um what group haven t i talked to matthew explain to us the set up of your group do you want to start i don t know what to say oh okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it so we decided maybe it s not color so we took a black pen a big one um we took a black pen and then two red pens of different type and two blue pens of different type and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue it was the bic pens so we decided there must be something in that in the chemical structure of that ink that s you know similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort um and the termites followed it okay um did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday yeah after school that was extracurricular all right so but we figured out the bic pens we figured that out okay good excellent set up there were there any variables that when i was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens you got this yeah we were drawing with different shapes cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing so we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it and they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape it might be in the pen or the color they don t really like sharp angles though we drew a square and they got lost yeah they couldn t find the angle okay interesting so um if any of you did do any sort of research you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit and we learned that those were what pheromones enzymes enzymes not enzymes what are pheromones having to do with we just spent three days on it animal behavior animal behavior communication their chemical signals okay so we learned that termites emit these pheromones we might have encountered this last time and that s the same thing why ants follow a specific trail um when honeybees sense danger they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out that danger s coming but the pheromone that termite s emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen in bic and papermate pens actually mimics the chemical in the pheromones which is why they followed certain pens,1.0
work of art in front of the class using the smart board we have to continue working please we have to finish the whole thing today you should have enough time if y all aren t drawing on the artwork that much but y all been working hard and a little bit of playing but working pretty well after you get finished with the analysis go ahead and flip over and start on your interpretation what you think is going on or what the artist is trying to portray in the work of art all right so y all are on interpretation yeah what do y all think of the work of art kaitlin what do you think of the work of art well it makes us feel like calm it made me feel calm it made y all feel calm no it made me feel calm it made me feel calm okay now have any of y all been out west huh out west like colorado wyoming places like that yeah yeah well sometimes in the mountains they have places where the snow has melted and there are actually small lakes or ponds up inside the mountains so you could actually either be looking at a lake where you could drive up to or something that s hidden in the mountains so if you re calm that s a pretty good idea all right guys what are y all working on now we re on judging the building i keep working on one okay can you tell me what you have about interpretation i think of this art as a rainy day the sky is a dull gray i like the bright colors on the doors it s like a mixture of happiness and boredom since it looks like it s raining the dark clouds at the top of the painting when it goes from white to dark like from light and it s going to dark that s when you can tell it s about to rain okay gotcha gotcha sounds good that sir is my interpretation okay and with judgment what are y all think about the work of art right now my judgment of the art is that it s kind of a boring day it s slightly dull but you don t know what s about to happen sounds good so far keep working y all doing all right over here yeah we re doing i wrote my opinion now he s gonna write his opinion yeah and then brody will write his opinion sounds great all right y all on interpretation what y all had oh y all are each doing interpretation yes sir we were going to do that for judgment and interpretation sounds great and what are y all looking at now for interpretation with the subway painting we re doing what it makes you feel okay what do you have so far well he wrote most of them okay so he can read it okay actually it makes me feel like traveling okay since they re on a train and that s pretty much it all right who would like to tell me what they are thinking of for interpretation on valley flowers i don t know i mean it s a good painting but it s not really my favorite okay it s not very exciting so that would be for judgment you don t find it exciting okay kind of boring what do you think of the work of art i think it s a bit dull because there s not really any colors or anything like that and it s got the same colors where each right here is green and right here is orange and blues back there you know if i was using my imagination i would think of maybe the incredibles in where the mole men came up at the end and were taking over the earth so these could be tunnel boring machines start using the principles of design okay so you look at the packet for the principles of design with the principles of design you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art so instead of shapes you may be telling me what s something you see in your work of art you ve got gold is where you find it what s one thing you see in the work of art gold you see gold what else do you see the miner miner and what is the miner doing drilling drilling okay so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art so go ahead and start on the second part with analysis if you re ready to start on that alright are we doin alright here yeah we don t get how was the work created okay you may have actually answered that when you were up here if you look at the packet right here and the title of the work of art is the sky pond read the rest for me who it was who created it kauvar kauvar yeah close enough smith smith born cape ugh this is hard if you can t pronounce it just do the best you can giradeau missouri missouri 1893 died denver colorado 1977 oil on canvas uh what did you say oil on canvas is how it was created and it was about this size right here okay so that tells you how the work of art was created later on you re gonna look at why the work of art was created and what purpose it served yes what do i say how i know what we do it says if they draw it in three dimensional okay and they take some kind of colored pencil or painting and then sketch it like you do and then they go from dark to light yeah and then they make the texture from the sun is over here and there s a little bit of shade because this would be covering all this there would be a shade right here so it s over here it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree yeah and this side of the house roof and that side of the house and you ve got are these shapes back here or are those somethin else these are shapes okay are shapes flat or three dimensional three dimensional shape forms are three dimensional alright oh yeah yeah so those are forms so those are forms yeah but you were right about everything you were right about the sun you were right about the texture the shading everything that s really good so you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger and also oil on canvas continue working please alright so y all are on analysis now and what work of art do y all have y all have got subway alright so what are y all lookin at in the subway for analysis so far it s something asymmetrical balance it s asymmetrical balance yeah there are three types you ve got symmetrical balance when everything is exactly the same you ve got asymmetrical balance when it s weighted the same so there s the same amount of weight visually it s not exactly the same and then you ve got radial symmetry which is a project we did a little bit earlier okay good so is it saying that shapes especially right here these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat cause these are more 3 d than these these kind of have shadows and are free so we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the outside factors i guess yes mm hmm good keep going alright would this be water that is possibly water right there yes it is and what part are y all on y all are on the analysis right now okay and y all are lookin at the valley farms by rose dickinson okay cool so what do y all have so far for analysis colors from the scene go together it can show could you speak a little louder sorry colors from the scene go together it can show a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there a small fire is going on with smoke coming from the flames smoke is coming from the mountains sounds good keep going alright let s check in over here how are y all doin good okay wow y all have got a lot for an analysis alright what else do you have so y all are about ready to start on analysis yes sir okay so let s look here now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made are related to each other i e how the effects were organized complement one another or create harmony or distress this step can often be the most confusing because it is very similar to the first and can easily overlap a good suggestion is think about all the principles of art movement rhythm variety portion emphasis and balance and contrast work together okay so think about how they work together to create this work of art and tell me everything you see in the work of art but not by shape and colors alright the shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will what a texture what the the shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will like he is actually drilling near a cave creative now would you say these warm colors or cool colors warm warm way warm warm now why would you say they re warm colors cause they re darker they re darker okay it shows that the colors of the background yeah now something else does it look like he blends into the background no he doesn t yeah uh huh okay so think about that too if he stood out he would look like he maybe didn t belong but it kind of looks like he belongs there i like what you said keep working i ll be back in a minute to check on you alright guys turn around alright what are y all workin on now analysis analysis what do y all have for analysis so far patrick i didn t get that i got one for variety and balances okay so something is different from this picture can you just read to me what you have so far please something s different from this top picture because the floor is green beneath the room because it s different because i thought i thought the floor s just one color so that s why it s different okay that s good and it s also different from up here you could say that there s a contrast let s look for the definition of contrast in here do you all know what the definition of contrast is or what contrast is two things are very different from i was on balance i m on balance now okay so contrast is what one more time i m sorry two things that are very different and have a large contrast okay so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast yeah because they re bright colors and they give out perspective what about the two cs okay two c s so keep going alright what part are y all on now analysis and y all have got the subway okay so can you read to me what you have or tell me something that you haven t added but you were about to jaymen s adding that okay i wanna add it has radial balance because you can kinda see where the center print is and then you can kind of see all these people all these stuff okay now i have a question have y all seen that there s a commercial on a few months ago it s a radio commercial yeah the tv where she s sitting in the train and she s watching the tv someone s reading the newspaper and she s watching the tv and she steps out and it looks like they may have gotten the idea from that ad from this work of art cause there s lots of people on the train car they re reading newspapers and she steps into the future by actually reading her s on a samsung galaxy or something like that so that d be a good connection to popular culture okay hello i was just which one we were talkin about earlier okay sounds good what s up okay alright what ya on okay what added or what have y all gotten to since i was last over here we see the ocean behind the mountains green grass is covering the farmland and the lines on the mountains are curved not pointed the mountains are curved okay the houses are spread apart the sky is a light green blue sounds good and it sounds like y all are just about finished with analysis so are y all gonna be moving on to interpretation next okay yeah active listening right hand active listening left hand ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups but please remember that we are all doing different works of art studying them and we re also discussing them together so that everybody s able to work without yelling across can we take it down just a notch a little bit please keep it a little bit lower i m not telling you to whisper and i m not telling you to stop what you re doing cause your doing a great job just let us take it down a notch please keep working please alright how are y all doin over here we re doing really good okay what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art it said that for the first question well the first thing we said the artist douglass crockwell is using repetit well is repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting and right now we re writing how classes are organized and how it s saying what we introduced for description okay now with paper workers now let s look at the workers the workers do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art no they kind of look like they blend in so could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery mhmm okay so that s something you may wanna think about when you re working on analysis or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit can you go touch the keyboard to bring the smart board back on please alright what are y all workin on now i don t know you don t know okay you don t know what principles you ve covered or you don t know what aspect of the painting you re working on right now we re working on analysts and so far we ve covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other we covered what colors they have and how they can relate we re about to work on shapes shapes are in there so let s think about texture some yeah we are look at the definitions okay and let s look at i wouldn t look at space or balance variety and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion okay okay we are completely totally and absolutely confused of analysis i m not you re just analysis okay i m not i m completely finished she s going all haywire okay what s wrong with analysis here i don t know nothing nothing s wrong with the analysis nothing s wrong with analysis she s going haywire i do not understand what art is active listening right hand please active listening left hand table four please ladies and gentlemen when we stopped a moment ago because we had gotten too loud let s take it down to a whisper now that way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud so right now let s take it to a whisper for our discussions please alright with analysis what you re doing is you re looking at the principles of design don t worry about balance let s flip to the beginning now let s look at texture do you have a texture in here yeah and what kind of texture do you have well it s really bumpy but some of it is smoother like a snow okay so that s what you could talk about in the analysis also in the analysis with balance is it asymmetrical symmetrical or radial now symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides radial is when it s radiating out from a point like a rim or a pizza is it either one of those so i d look a little bit at asymmetrical balance and then variety i look at the definition and then determine what variety you see in here and after that go ahead and move over to interpretation okay that way if you re being frustrated you don t have to get bogged down and worry about it you can move to the next step you might find that easier okay keep going thanks alright so y all are on interpretation now yep okay what are y all about to do for interpretation can someone read me the interpretation part basically how does the painting make you feel what does it make you think of don t say you think a painting sucks artwork sucks that said that goes in the next step what do you think what do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer okay so let s bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you re working on the questions and think about telling me a story or what s going on now does this look like you re in a cafeteria no does it look like you re in a school oh yeah no it looks like a barber shop okay and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop he s shaving cutting someone s hair now what about over here these guys are probably waiting for their turn okay that s what you need to tell me in interpretation what all is going on or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story we re talking about the story that s created in the work of art alright what part are y all on interpretation yeah okay so it kind of makes me feel like it makes me feel sad it was when i think of it before and it really doesn t make me feel sad i m not really sure how it makes me feel but i kind of think that maybe he was trying to say it went from cause this is kind of simple okay and i keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason but i think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler and it kind of got more modern i like that i like that and also one thing that this makes me think of is earlier this year we studied the artist jacob lawrence and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train controlling that with only industry in the background with the big cog or wheel here it kind of looks like a train over here with industry in the background but i like what you re saying about the calmer times and the more difficult times and i think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation it doesn t look like a train though yeah alright how are y all doing y all doin alright hey what part are y all workin on now y all got valley farm yeah yeah interpretation okay what do y all have so far for interpretation this painting makes us feel bright but kind of boring the smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it we also wonder why is there a fire with nobody there okay sounds good ah can you put your stool back up on two legs one more time thanks alright what are y all on right now analysis and y all have moved on to interpretation mhmm sounds good active listening right hand active listening left hand right in here we have about seven minutes left this should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation and start on their judgment today after you get finished with your interpretation one thing i would like you to focus on is why you think the work of art was created think about the time period in which it was created and why the artists were creating works of art think about your work of art particularly and you ll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that so continue working on what you re working on we have about seven minutes next time you come in what we re gonna be doing is we re gonna be working on presenting so those groups that have enjoyed this will be able to look at the smithsonian packet find their information add that to what they ve been doing today and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about,1.0
okay so put these where they need to go on the board and liz your job is graphing so harper tell me about your data you your plant is 20 centimeters okay and it s grown 11 centimeters wow that s a lot of growth isn t it good job and emma what s your job you were the recorder and so some of the observations the leaves are bigger it has grown bigger in the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves cool in the middle of the leaves there s tiny leaves that is interesting and your cotyledon has come off okay so that s good excellent okay so coby you re going to be using the board and putting your data up there so tell me how high how tall is your plant now 20 centimeters okay let s go check your graph we re out of room i have more so next time you ll have a graph that will be take two of this and it will be 40 centimeters because 20 plus 20 is 40 so here s your 20 centimeter line what needs to go down here okay now remember to help parker with observations natalie does the board oh natalie go up there okay girls let s talk about what your findings are because just a second talk to me about what happened with your plant let s take a look so what do you think has is the reason for it not changing it was 10 centimeters when you started it was 10 centimeters again on monday okay but that s okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination it s done with that now and it can grow without it is it a growing plant looking at your graph is it growing so maybe the leaves will get bigger and then the roots will get bigger too the roots will get bigger the water and the nutrients okay let s take a look at your observations roots longer white root cotyledon fell off leaves are pointy bigger leaves now what did we observe about the growth about the growth of the plant what did we observe about it i think we should include that in your observations okay so observer should record that okay boys and girls i need all board job people to come on up here okay now you guys one at a time are going to fill in your data make sure that you re choosing a new color and i m going to make sure that these have seen all of your i don t think i ve heard about your growth here okay tell me about what happened joshua you need to go sit down work on the math you re not ready for that yet okay so talk to your group and see what you need to do next okay so tell me about what has how about the growth right now it is okay so alex yes go get some now your plant has it s 12 centimeters now it started at so how much total growth has okay so it started at the 10 and now it s a 12 so can we make that who s the recorder so we want to make that because this is how much is it growing okay so it s growing and let s look at our graph you ve got your day and now oh so you went up a little bit too high here let s take a pencil alex and just do a small x right there so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12 maybe more so that we can see it keep erasing it that s good don t play with your plant please if you re all finished you should be working on the math problems okay now let s talk about your plant okay let me come around here tell me about your plant it started to get bigger the shell was growing out and we it s and how much has it grown total 50 oh five five that s right you started at seven and now you re at 12 so the difference between that s exactly the same as my plant too what i noticed about yours is over the week it came out of like you said the seed cover came off and the leaves started to peel and it started to break yeah okay so the stem is really long let s put this up here the leaves are bigger who is the observer you are okay and can we see something about the seed cover okay so while he s doing that we need to do some important things here what about the date one 30 goes here because that was monday one slash 30 okay and today s date is okay and that s it because today s the third and this bar shows natalie go sit down this bar shows that good job you guys and you ve got that added and let s make sure that we re gentle with that measuring you can work on it together molly stay with your group you guys work on that together you guys can work on it together so you guys have had what s the most common number of seeds they found five five good how about the total number of seeds now do we know is each dot worth one okay so what s the total number of seeds so how many seeds in all okay boys and girls sophia s finishing up if you have math extension problems in your table group please put those to the side and i m going to ask chloe s group and angel s group and derek s group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we re close to our graph you do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already chloe come join us please alright ashton and josiah you can move closer so you can see or you can stay there coby and isaiah please come join us alright now one last person needs to fill in her data let s see that would be me and my height was 16 okay so while i m doing that take a look at the graph we just built and think about what are some things that you notice about the graph what do you see what are some things in common what are some things that are different turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph okay eyes on me now you tell me what are some things that you noticed about the graph alex that six and three has the same height as us okay so group six and three and you are group five five all have the height of all the way across and it s 10 12 centimeters that s right so we have three groups that have the same height ashton what did you notice so group one four and your group eight they re all not matching but all the other ones have a match so group eight and one and four are separate they don t have someone who s kind of similar so that leads me to ask about groups two and seven tell me about them blake seven and two are the same seven and two are the same they both are the same why keith because they both have 20 20 centimeters so what group on there has the smallest plant alfredo what group on there has the smallest plant group four toby and how tall is group four s plant ten centimeters ten centimeters that s right now group four molly tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant,1.0
okay guys i see we ll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication okay so can you read the objective with me please so i i will be able to do fraction multiplication okay i ve also put it in spanish just in case that helps you okay so the first thing i want to discuss with you today is what do you think about that do you agree or disagree and then why so one half does one half equal one half why or why not and then give me some examples okay raul it s becuase it is one half they re the same okay abraham it s like you cut a pear in half it s gonna be in equal parts okay so you guys are saying it s equal yes okay what do you think eddie believes he thinks the same thing taleah what do you think i think it s the same you think it s the same does everyone think it s the same i do until you think why wouldn t it be the same okay so jose is saying why wouldn t they be the same okay so one thing jose says is he s trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn t be the same joe it s not the same because no that s just the board point is there a times nope it s just one over two equals one over two i was thinking it was a half times a half okay so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it s the same right yeah so now how do you explain to me why you think it s the same why you think it s the same joe because they have equal parts okay equal parts what do you mean by equal parts they have the same fraction okay jose they re both practically the same thing what do you mean by practically the same thing that once you cut a square in half you have equal parts and they re gonna be the same thing okay who is someone we haven t heard from madeline what do you think so i heard you say they are the same right yeah so why do you think they are the same cause they re both equal parts and the same cause half equals a half okay antonio what do you think think it s the same so sounds like we re all thinking it s the same okay abraham what do you think i think they equal the same thing equals the same thing okay so now let s take a look at maybe cause it sounds like we re all on the same path here so let s take a look at something else are they really the same is that half of a cookie cookie half of a cookie half a pizza are they the same no yes one at a time cause i m hearing a lot of good stuff but you guys are all saying it at the same time okay miguel they re the same cause if they weren t the same is just half so i m hearing they re the same but one s bigger than the other one cause one s a pizza and one s a cookie yeah tina you re kind of shaking your head what do you think about that i think they re both the same cause they re still one half they are just different size victoria what do you think same or not the same same cause it s still half okay so let me ask you this i m hearing a couple things and it s kind of contradicting itself meaning you re saying one thing but you re also saying the opposite like i heard it s the same because it s one half but it s different because it s different sizes different sizes you just told me it s the same but now you re telling me it s different sizes they are both fattening oh cookies and pizza are both fattening okay felice why i think they re still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it s big or small because it s still chopped in half okay so if a half of a half so would you rather have half of 10 or half of 100 half of a 100 why because it s bigger because it s bigger but i thought it was the same no no cause it s the same thing it s still half but you re commenting half of a hundred it has to be the same thing like the pizza a whole pizza and you cut it in half okay you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen for it to be half for it to be half but here it s not the same thing you re saying to me that it is equal so which is it so now you re saying you don t think they re the same no you get more pieces than a cookie they re still the same they re still half okay so who still agrees that the one half equals one half raise your hand okay alright now who says that one half maybe sometimes doesn t equal one half okay so we got a couple alright so delphina what s your thinking i haven t heard from you what s your thinking i think it depends on what you are looking at so in case you didn t hear her delphina said it depends okay hear what she said it depends on what you re looking at cause she said with the money example that you guys well all of you unanimously chose half of a hundred that s 50 as opposed to 5 half of 10 so it does matter so now we just go back to the question does one half equal one half okay raul i think one half equals one half i think it s still the same it s not talking about how big it is it s just talking about a half but it didn t say in the question what it was i think the question is supposed to say what it was to say if it s the same or not okay so what dallas is saying what dallas is saying that it needs to tell you what one half is cause she s saying here the previous question just had the number one over two one over two equal alright here she s saying well all of a sudden yeah the numbers are gone but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie so now it s not the same but it s the same question what dallas is saying in the question it should tell you what is it it s actually like 10 fives five tenths and and one half so what do you think what s your final thought as far as one half equals one half what s your final thought they re still the same it s a half it s still the same because it s half okay it s the same and different it s the same and different miguel and they tell you it s different okay so good question good question i like the look of that yes if they are are they the same they re the same it s one half or something one is bigger than the other one okay rodrigo what about you bud what s your thoughts on this i m still thinking you re still thinking or are you still will you compete i m still basically undecided okay you think they re basically the same so you added that basically why don t you just put they re the same why did you put basically because one s bigger than the other it will obviously still be different where we re going with this is you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is your whole unit okay alright so that s why sometimes you have to be careful what it s asking you to do okay let s go on to the next one okay so what does one half look like to you so just think right now in your head when you think of one half okay what do you see half a dollar half of a dollar half a fifty half a fifty half a gallon of juice half a gallon of juice half a body half of a body half of a cake half of a cake okay guadalupe what do you see half a paper half a paper okay so let me take it to the next step so what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice does it make sense no does it make sense no it doesn t make sense so we have to make sure that we know what you have to make sense well it makes sense but how is it gonna make sense it s what if they re the same if they re the same but what s the same the object the object or the whole unit right like what is it we re talking about we talking about pizza we talking about cookies paper paper juice people people eggs alright so the other thing i wanna talk to you about is does multiplication always make things larger bigger yes no so i heard yes yes yes and then no so now then what cause sometimes it makes it smaller if you do nine times one it s gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero it makes it zero jessie did you hear her example no okay so what she said was cause it s important i want you to make sure you understood she said that no because nine times one is nine then when you go nine times zero it s zero so it actually made it less right what do you think though when you multiply in general when you multiply does it make things larger when you multiply two things together yes okay abraham it gets bigger because like six times two it s 12 and it gets bigger okay raul what do you think raul v when you multiply does it always get bigger it depends on the number what it depends on the number it depends on the number so give me an example zero times 8100 is gonna be zero okay so can we so i m hearing kind of like a lot of you are saying yes it makes it larger but there s still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always like if we go back to if we go back to that one half if we go back to that one half and that dollar gino what s 100 times one half times one half is a hundred and a half a hundred and a half 50 50 i got 150 150 taylor do you agree one hundred times one half is 150 raul b 500 five hundred how d you get five hundred i thought it was half of a thousand a hundred though no more thousand one hundred one hundred times one half is it 110 half of 10 is five half of 10 is five so what is your answer the one hundred times one half five hundred five hundred okay so one hundred times one half is five hundred tina we don t know because we don t know what one half equals okay so tina s saying now you don t know what the one half is what if we re just talking about numbers one hundred times one half what would that be one hundred times one half let s say it s money a hundred dollars times one half it could be five or 50 if we re talking about 100 then it s gonna be one half of 100 is 35 okay so 45 there was a lot of people talking so you couldn t hear but louis is saying it depends but if you re talking about money if it was hundred dollars times one half it d be half of 100 which is 50 let s take that example one hundred times one half is 50 so then when we multiply that did it get larger no yeah it got smaller didn t it you start with a hundred and you multiply and you got 50 which is less so what do you think now do you think it always makes things bigger no sometimes it makes it smaller so let s can you give me another example then that s just make sure we prove it is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then like five times four five times four we start with five times four you get what 20 it s a bigger number okay so that s if you multiply it times a half right ten times one half ten times one half would be five raise your hand if you think it doesn t always make it bigger it depends on what you multiply it by alright very good so we re gonna use the area model to show one half times one half that s a whole one half times one half abraham says it s a whole but let s go ahead and let s take a look i m gonna go ahead and shade in one half okay and then we ll take a look to see what it actually equals here s a half there s a half how many squares are shaded both colors one two one out of how many total four one fourth so one half times one half is one fourth is one fourth smaller than one half yes that s another proof that when you multiply it doesn t always get bigger you could make it into money like one fourth is 25 cents alright very good a hundred divided by so let s take a look at another example if we re to use an area models for this what would that look like three fourth it d be one half right we d see one half times one fourth so what do you think half of a fourth one eighth half of a fourth which is one eighth he said one half of one fourth is one eighth do you agree yeah okay,1.0
these colors what color is this yellow oh my gosh did you find a lot of leaves that match this color no you forgot to do it well let s do it right now alright go ahead and put it there what other ones are yellow mmm that s a yellow one is that yellow okay put it right there let s see if we put these two together do they match in color no no so you might not want to put that one in okay wow so put it here you ve already given it a check so now what i want you to do by looking at the sheet i want you to sort by size what does size mean if something is bigger if something is bigger or smaller now which measurement which size are you going to sort by big or little big okay so all your big leaves put them in the middle okay you decide how you want to sort them so if you want to use both baggies that s okay if you want to just use one that s okay too okay that s okay that s okay too i noticed that you haven t started sorting yet so which one do you want to sort by or do you want to make up your own i like to do this yeah color color okay so ok what color are you going to choose i m gonna choose brown jennifer is that ok you have to ask your partner sort by brown so put all the leaves that match the brown in your work space ok let s see what s going on over here ok well let me see this let me see that please ok we are going to work with partners i know sometimes it can be hard to work with partners because you re trying to make a choice and maybe one person wants to do one thing and maybe one person wants to do another so we re gonna work together to figure this out well let s get working she s laughing how do you want to sort your leaves now let s get our workspace in the middle i notice you already sorted by color so now how do you want to sort by shape ask your partner if that s ok ask your partner if that s ok ok is this the shape you want to sort by oh this is pretty tricky see if you have any more leaves that match this shape how can you describe this shape how can you describe that shape so you re going to look for ones that have little points so you re actually sorting by points yes am i hearing that right so look at your leaves and look for ones that have teeny tiny points look at your leaves so look at your leaves here ones that have teeny tiny points it has points its very tiny does it have points no no side points yes does it have some side points do you think that belongs here oh really i loved how you used your magnifying glass to find those little details keep on looking through yours jennifer because i have a feeling that you are going to find some more take a look at these points and take a look at these points you re sorting by points right are those little points or big points little or big little are they little like this are you sure so you think this belongs here okay don t worry about your name for right now i ve noticed that you ve sorted by every way now are you ready for the challenge can you make up your own way to sort something that we didn t talk about on friday oh i bet you could yeah well let s think a little bit more now i want you to look very very closely at these leaves what s something that s the same about some of them that s the question that you should be asking yourself what s the same about some of these leaves they have dots really they have dots remember we had colors up here andrew just said something some of these had dots do you see dots on some of your leaves yes do you think that s a good way to sort so wow see i thought you said you couldn t figure out another way so i want you to put all of the leaves with dots on your workspace okay how are we sorting here that s okay the way you re doing it is perfect all you need to shoot for is to keep count of what you ve done so far so let me come to you i ve noticed that you had sorted by color so far which one is next which one would you like to do next okay which one do you want to do it s up to you do you want to sort by big leaves is that okay monica okay so look at your leaves and sort by size now find all of your leaves that are big uh oh does this one belong there does this one belong there okay wow amazing i like how you re really looking at your leaves absolutely that one s very big nice job i really love how children stopped working they put their hands up friends can i share something that i noticed is that okay when i was walking around i noticed children using their eyes and sometimes their hands to explore their leaves some of you figured out new ways to sort your leaves and i can t wait for those kids to share their ways some of you went ahead and you looked at what we talked about on friday which was also a really great way to use a resource in our room to help us sort i just want to remind everybody that your job right now is not to touch your leaves your job right now is not to touch your leaves your leaves are down because it s important for scientists to stop what they re doing and share what they have noticed let s take a peek this is a graph does anybody recognize this graph does it look like something we already do what is it raise your hand if you want to share it kind of looks like you use something it s something we do every almost every day brian um the calendar yes and what in our calendar sweetheart looks like that the weather oh i love how you re thinking absolutely right our weather calendar looks like this today friends we re going to share how you sorted and then i m going to go ahead i m going to color in boxes and then at the end we re gonna see what was the most popular way to sort what was maybe not the most popular way and if anyone had a different way to sort okay so just give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size look at your sheet look at your sheet and give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size today let s see and actually i m only going to ask one partner to put their thumb up because i m only counting partners so one group two groups three groups four groups five groups six seven eight groups nine groups ten groups eleven groups twelve groups uh oh do i have enough spaces no oh my gosh i ll have to add them eleven twelve so there were twelve groups there s thirteen that wanted that sorted by this kind mrs you forgot mine okay anybody sort by shape today anybody sort by shape today okay keep your thumbs up one two okay one two three four five six seven eight nine ten wow ten groups sorted by shape mrs you keep forgetting mine mrs you keep forgetting mine okay friends before we continue going on with that did you sort by another way today did you sort by another way that wasn t something we talked about on friday emma did you sort by a different way today oh sorry you re two joel and emma i ll come to you what s another way you sorted okay did someone sort by a completely different way that s not on your chart andrew dots dots did anybody sort by dots today yeah okay what s another way you sorted your leaves catherine counting the points okay now that was a way that we sorted on our sheet but that s okay how s it different so you were looking for nine points okay so friends there s so many different ways you can sort and i just want you to put your hands down because there s so many different ways you can sort and there s many more ways than just what we practiced today as scientists and mathematicians we re gonna continue sorting and looking for similarities things that are the same things and things that are different give yourself a pat on the back thank you so much friends for doing your best job today,1.0
okay look at your music we are doing four parts obviously with them take just a general idea for the whole thing raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes sopranos where do you have eighth notes shelby tell me measure nine say it really loud so they all hear you measure nine measure nine very good audrey where do you have eighth notes measure thirteen thirteen good reese where do you have eighth notes measure nine and measure measure nine and thirteen hey what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part then same rhythm almost the same rhythm all the way through tenors where do you have eighth notes braden twenty one and twenty two twenty one and twenty two so getting toward the very very end altos tell us something about your part rhythmically raise your hand give me a summation of what you do jamie we don t have any you don t have any at all you only have quarter notes half notes and some whole notes so how many beats does a half note take up everybody two two make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes solf ge what key are we in where is do brady f f major so the first pitch that the altos have is do do sopranos what s your starting pitch mi basses what s your starting pitch do tenors sol very good look at it for a second there are some jumps in the very beginning they don t mess around right away we ve got some eighths and some intervals chant on solf ge your part one and two and three and four and very good go on two three four on the second to last measure on the first page bassists and altos will move stepwise motions so you ll they both go up one step be aware of that notice that we have some repetition do you see some patterns that are coming back so if you miss it the first time you get a second shot where if you get it right the first time remember what it sounds like so you can do it again continuing second page one two three and chant freeze let s go back and join the basses with us at measure nine do re mi everyone measure nine and okay sopranos careful it might screw up your voice why did you have an issue there why did you miss it it s a skip because it s a skip in the melody and why else a practical reason here to here because it s hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one top of the next page measure seventeen a little faster and go sorry seventeen sopranos fa altos la tenors fa basses fa ready hey everybody has fa that might be a good place to find the measure la this will help you re right sorry except the altos listen right there when you re actually singing for that and go you ll have to hold this for a very long time go back to the beginning the rule is number six jesse repeat the last step the last step oh never quit singing never quit singing look up find your keys points okay second key do mi so mi do so do sing your starting note one two three four good now i have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads do a quick run through because it s hard to know i cant remember what i missed i m still freaking out about the whole thing take a minute replay it in your head find areas where there were problems for you overall you did extremely well you listened to each other you could hear that it sounded like music if you weren t sure about an interval you would sing it and then you would go oh this is right yes and you were affirmed and i think you got more confident as you went along problem areas raise your hands if you had one chelsea my problem i had was with measure seventeen seventeen sopranos do to fa that s a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there so then you heard it and you were able to go on and then i liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen finding fa that s a strange function in the music yes patrick measure nineteen fa to la okay nineteen fa to la just making sure that you know where you re moving fa to la where oh nineteen yes sorry my eyes were at seventeen good bass hands excellent thank you grant where twenty twenty yes and what did you do i couldn t figure out the notes i mean i couldn t figure out the i think it surprises you because you move up by a step you were fine so la and the ti you weren t willing to actually sing ti because it s not very often that you sing it stepwise motion so la ti do you did an excellent job basses throughout then returning to so and do when you had it you had some issues with fa and la colin six and seven where we were going from la to fa and then back to do and then we had an eighth notes because of that okay so being aware of when you have eighth notes and chances are there isn t ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don t so when you hear it then you can move with them and it s always by step when you have eighth notes and it s always ascending so you don t have to worry about going down anywhere but yes fa and la continue to be icky i didn t time it we have to sing it again i m so sorry okay so we fixed the things that we missed we re going a little faster so it sounds like music and not just this exercise listen across the room to each other do mi you stayed very well in tune do mi so mi do so do set your key remember you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can if you look up basses i m trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often sing your first note please one two three four have a seat and now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second that means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time and if you haven t had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet it s time because this is opinion time and there s no wrong the room is going to tip over from the hands on this side there are four sections jamie well sometimes they re like a step away from each other but something like i know they re like one long and sometimes i okay so there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time okay hannah i thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time i would agree the first time you did better than the second there are a couple of reasons for this raise your hand if you feel like when you think back on how well you ve done both times you did better the first time why why emily because you were so focused and trying to get it right so the second time we ve already gone through it so we relaxed a little and little things slip up okay some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much what else possibly colin i think some of us got a little too over confident ohhh that s an excellent thing to check just making sure some of you don t get a little over confident although basses the fa s and la s were much better this time as an overall section amanda if the first time usually there s a few problem areas for me then i try to focus on them way too much and then i see the spots where it might have been tricky for me like that jump from la to do so i freak myself out about that even though i got it right both times you get stuck in your head a little bit yeah okay so doubting yourself and then not being sure what else can happen ariella along with what emily said about how we sometimes get over confident because we ve already seen it and we just fly by it because we re not really trying to pay attention to it too much okay ryan measure nine it s the so so mi i went back to the so because that s what we did on the first page oh okay because you re remembering now the patterns that you had you get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time that s a good thought too michaella between the and because we to sing notes over and over again over and over again i didn t like it it s kind of hard i didn t get the first two notes right and finally on like the third note i think i just figured out what we were doing patrick i think that sometimes because we ve already sung the music and now i think that we kind of know what s going on,1.0

most friends have finished their first trials i wanted to talk real quick about what s happened on your first trial who wants to share what happened on your first three trials and i want to know was it something that you predicted would happen cody at first we kinda got a little it kind of got a little complicated since you came around it fixed it a little why was it complicated cause the rest of the group didn t see your experiment why was it complicated because it keep turning and the wax paper was what kept turning the car your car kept turning yeah and the wax paper kept coming off and turning it so it was a little complicated so after you got it fixed and after i helped you then what did you find out that it was kind of easy to do so did your measurement did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be when it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance we thought it was gonna i thought it was gonna go very far because that s a little bit slicker because that it s slippery well i was listening to another group talk about something i think it was at bhavana s group raise your hand if you re in bhavana s group and really deep had really good observation because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too but you told me something about the surface that we were testing on i said the the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough so do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we re testing on being rough if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car s going to travel give me a thumb s up i think that makes a difference lucy why do you think it makes a difference the carpet there s a feel of bumps if you could feel it and the wax paper is slippery so that s how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast like if they have wheels or something it makes stuff fast that s true so as we get ready for our next test you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial but i want you to predict now that you ve kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel looking at your information your measurements i want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface and we re choosing to use the shelf liner today the black shelf liner in your tub do you think the car s going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial we may only get through one trial and that is okay alright but i want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start so lawson what are you gonna do first before you test get in a group meeting and sit down and meet yeah and talk about your predictions first that s what good scientists do they re always making really good predictions about what they ve observed alright go i m setting the timer i think it will go really bumpy well not really bumpy but a little bumpy and it might go just a little less than the smooth i think that it will go slower because the surface it s really bumpy and one time i went on this bumpy slide and i did not go down very quickly don t worry about recording the information right now but we ll record in a little bit i think they re gonna go a little bit far i bet slower hey you can t pick off of me i think that it s gonna go farther and faster i think it s gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster i think it s gonna go a little bit slower i think it s kind of gonna go since it s bumpy it s gonna slow it down i think it was gonna go farther group meeting s over so you think it s gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper no i think it s going a little bit slower but still a little fast like medium so you don t think it s gonna change that much why do you think that cause it doesn t feel too too bumpy it doesn t feel too too bumpy she s making a really good observation what do you think jaylin my predict is when you put the car on it it s gonna kinda go medium it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast and then when it gets to the carpet it s gonna go slower and then it s gonna turn it s gonna go a lot slower and then it s going to turn i think like that fast okay not too fast not as fast as the wax paper go ahead and test but let s think about your setup here before you move this let s look at your setup as the car rolls what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug what might happen it might get stopped remember the car s going to continue to move until something makes it stop so what might you want to do with your ramp we might want it to be here so it will go straighter but it might bump into the black box it may well you know the rug is going to i don t mean there but i mean i know what we could do we could do it this way so it won t crash well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way javier could you go get us some tape it may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape try it and see let s try it without some yeah it doesn t even need tape who s the task manager here me look out he s doing the first test i think it should be jaylin okay jaylin now do you test sideways we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn t agree and you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same javier can you move out of the way you ready now wait a minute wait a minute cause i bet you probably got his on tape jaylin show me how you did that again go get the car watch what he did with his popsicle stick cause i hadn t seen that before do it just like you did the first time what did he do with his popsicle stick he flipped it down do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up why might it make a difference olivia because it might when you put it down you re putting it down fast and i bet it makes the car go a little bit faster and it gives it some force did it give it more force so jaylin is this surface the same as this surface is this the same as this yes i think is this popsicle stick the same as this here no so if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy no so what do you need to do with the popsicle stick raise it up you might want to raise it up next time alright try it again i ll come back and see if you guys are ready one two and go wow that was great now let s start measuring now we re gonna start measuring okay okay one two no tessa s gotta do that one two three ready oh my gosh we were right our first prediction is one two three four five six seven eight it s eight oh my gosh why s it eight and ours keeps getting a mess up i predicted eight too see i predicted seven mostly we got eight cubes on this one eight cubes really before we clean up i would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting i m gonna come around and be watching quick quick quick it s almost time for us to go about what you learned what you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used the shelf liner what did you learn from what you tested i learned that the bumpy surface made it go that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster how do you know that because when we use the smooth it went further how far did it go it went about eight cubes no i think it actually went seven i don t know we didn t put the lines behind it 36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes so that makes it the point where bumpy is slower so 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy the shelf liner i think it was seven on the bumpy big difference isn t it is that what you predicted no i didn t predict eight i predicted 16 no i didn t predict on the bumpy but i predicted i predicted one and i got the right answer for it on smooth alright well you guys have two more trials to do so we ll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three alright go ahead and get cleaned up we already cleaned most of them first well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub you can go ahead and record your data but we re gonna get cleaned up go ahead and get cleaned up alright push the red button you can push the red button mary come over here tell us what you learned okay mary come over here i learned that different surfaces can make something different whatever you re testing make it go fast and slow mary what did you learn i learned mostly the same thing except when we did that you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet it makes this go faster than the carpet which makes a difference yeah jaylin what did you learn i learned if you put the car on this it s gonna go a little bit faster if you put it on this it s gonna go a little bit almost fast and it s gonna stop and go slower and that s why it went right there okay does anybody have anything else javier what did you learn well i learned that if it s smoother it s quicker but if it s a little bumpy it s slower that s it alright everyone put your things in the bucket,1.0
like compared to osteoblasts the osteoclasts to be more efficient and work harder than the osteoclasts therefore you re more than you are building so that ratio can cause brittle bones so what okay right yeah one s up one goes down yeah if you re taking away more than you re putting back no i m sorry why don t osteo cause there s a lack of estrogen and or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work we kind of hit on that a little i don t know i kinda did but i kinda didn t what causes osteoblasts to work that it okay so when they re saying that the osteoclasts are working more what they re not saying more than they used to work they re saying more compared to the osteoblasts okay it s not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity they re just doing what they do it s just because the blast activity dropped which you guys got that the blast activity dropped why did that blast activity drop because there weren t enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting good is everybody get that cause see now the blast activity s what s really dropping and the clast activity keeps going like it normally goes but relative to one another you have more clast activity less blast activity and therefore you re losing bone everybody got that idea okay good you did a good job reasoning that out okay you can keep going matt okay our next question kind of gets off of like the description of osteoblasts and it says how can osteoblasts or how can osteoporosis be prevented brooke well they recommend having like a good number a good amount of calcium intake a day about 1 000 1 500 milligrams you could do that something simple like that could prevent like osteoporosis in the long run all right i would also suggest regular exercise in order to kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise so that there s less there s more bone actually broken down basically a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk along with everything else there s a i went to the food and drug administration you can have zoledronic acid which can be injected every two years for like prevention along with the diet and exercise anybody else have anything they d like to add i was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other nobody else okay now who s on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed yeah i found the most current one is a form called dual energy x ray reabsorption test to test the bone density you get a score of either one or below means you re normal one to 2 5 is osteoporosis 2 5 and above it s just your bones are gonna break any time all right anybody else there s just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density so there s like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative that s what they use cause it s like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not so you kinda need more ways to test good you can also take a sample of your and analyze it to see if there s any signs of erosion or anything that ll lead to osteoporosis okay what s that called anybody know what that s called what is it bioscan good before you even go to the doctor like it s really hard to diag like there s not really symptoms of it but some of the symptoms are like bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that and breaking bones with little or no trauma what do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma what kind of fracture traumatic traumatic would be if it was kind of trauma pathological good job yeah pathological fracture that would be a pathological fracture if there s a disease under there like osteoporosis which has made it weak enough to break good call so somebody mentioned the scanner zach right you talked about that the abbreviated what did what was the full name of that scan again dual energy x ray absorption okay has anyone ever heard of a dex scan dexa scanner that s where the d e x comes from dual energy x ray dexa scan and that s very common yeah is that like what the guy from pursuit of happiness yeah i don t know if you ever saw that movie i didn t yeah the bone density scanner i didn t know if that was it yeah okay so how did they what the general how they actually what bones do they look at in the scanner i think it was the wrist the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis the lumbar part of your spine because that s the first to go why what else is important to consider if you if you think about the type of bone being affected what type of bone being affected what type of bone i should remember trabeculae yeah so that s a spongy bone right so trabeculae of the spongy bone why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now it s a spongy bone yeah it s an irregular shaped bone but the body of the vertebrae is basically a cortex in and it s a spongy bone in there it s all trabeculae what was the other bones that you said madhura wrist and hip okay so hip as in what do you mean by that do you think robert ilium ilium it s all a spongy bone a spongy bone in the ilium good place to look for it but here s the thing what about the wrist how come think from a practical scenario how come the wrist yeah lexi i think it s cause you use it like so often that they is probably the most common because you use your wrist for like basically do you use it a lot another possible reason yeah kevin because it s a lot of like small bones so they may be easier to break or like be more fragile okay that s a possibility mikey i would say cause it s easy to get to like it s pretty hard to take like and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip it s kinda hard to get like a good angle but like your wrist can there s not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture okay thank you for that that s exactly why they use the wrist i mean the wrist bones when you think about em you know they re not weight bearing so they re probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones but they do have spongy bone in them they re little irregular shaped bones which have a cortex with some spongy bone so there is some material in there to evaluate but you don t have to disrobe you don t have to do anything you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what s called a screening a screening test has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before or thought of ever heard of screening tests being done for other things no not familiar with the screening tests i think i ve had one have you yeah because if i had like it wasn t for bones though it could be for anything like they were looking for appendicitis but they couldn t find it so they were doing other all these other kinds of tests i don t know if that well a screening test it could be it could be a screening test screening tests are basically more generalized testing not the most specific but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation okay so if you put your arm in the scanner and it was towards the low end it s not the best for making an end all you know quantitative diagnosis but it s a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium you see so that s why the arm so it s interesting that you brought that up that was really good cause it really helps us look at the whole where is this occurring and why do they use those specific bones okay matt anything else there our next question we have already said how it s diagnosed we know what it is so how can we treat osteoporosis well i said i found online that there were really no treatments like true treatments for osteoporosis it s more of trying to prevent it by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before because you can t really treat it once it s gone well that s funny i found something a little different there s a few medicines right now like talking about you ve seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it now they re actually saying like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you ve lost from the bones but it s also something kind of funny i saw if the bones start to become more dense they also found that like around your jaw starts to deteriorate faster some reason actually get like sore throat so i was wondering if anyone try to reason that out because i could not figure out why just your jaw starts losing calcium but your long bones start gaining it are you saying that they re taking medication and then they re experiencing pain so that yeah like the calcium to deteriorate but like your long bones it s like your limbs and everything start to become more dense is your jaw a lot of is it one of those bones yeah some but there isn t a whole lot in there there is some is it a more compact bone probably a more compact bone in your jaw there isn t a lot of cavity space or spongy bone space there maybe that has something to do with that even having a sore throat i don t know why that would affect it at all maybe because it s a horrible medicine i don t know like the thyroid gland like this one or the parathyroid this is like calcium like bone absorption so maybe i don t know it s not working as efficiently so it s not getting the through to the jawbone or maybe it s working too much or something maybe since your jaw is losing calcium and it s kinda gaining like losing its calcium so it s probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis your hyoid bone isn t your hyoid bone isn t it sort of high it doesn t really touch any other bones but it s kinda in there so it s kinda in your throat so that could be like i don t know it s kinda unusual just answer this one with the general area cause there s a lot of instances where you couldn t sit or lay down for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus so i don t know there were a lot of really bad side effects just well what i was wondering i kinda see like some doctors like just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention would be the other side to treatment just go do like those lifestyle changes instead of like thinking oh i ll wait until these signs come up and have platelet scans and i ll take medicine just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don t drink excessively and like have those good workout regimens so you prevent it rather than treat it yeah seems like a disease that s either prevented or managed not so much treated but i thought i think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids for like asthma like in your inhaler so it s something that inhibits bone breakdown so it doesn t sound like it treats it but it kind of manages it so you don t break bones yeah did anyone request a name a name brand fosamax did we see that yeah did they tell you how it worked no actually no well fosamax is like did you see something there zach yeah wasn t that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo osteo something bone reabsorption so they re inhibiting which cells osteoclasts okay yeah so that s how fosamax and those work they inhibit the osteoclasts so they re not building bone though you see the difference yeah they re not really building the bone they re stopping the erosion it s a little different but if you have like dead bone or old bone that needs to be replaced wouldn t that just inhibit it just as much because there s still old calcium sitting in your leg that i don t know whenever there s waste in your body that doesn t get dealt with i mean like when you have an appendectomy and there s waste in your appendix that like it can kill you if there s like waste in your body so maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis not so much as help it in the long run i m thinking cause any time you re keeping like something that s old in your body that s not good like you eat something you have to like you have to digest it and i don t know yeah it s a good thought process good thought process so that s what fosamax works that way so if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps let s say someone who has osteoporosis let s assume they have it now what types of mechanisms in other words what types of things will we try and get a drug to do what would we want it to do you want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better and someone already mentioned this but they had like estrogen supplements like supposedly like help out with that maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability okay well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement did anyone request that as a therapy yeah kevin and there s like these like it s like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches where you can take it as a pill so it adds estrogen to your body so it balances out your loss of estrogen and raises it yeah there s like he was talking about the hormone replacement but i also read on google health that it s rarely used and it s not used twice with women i don t know if that has anything to do with it i can google it i guess like if you use the treatment once any ideas why anybody find out why estrogen replacement they used to you know what they used to give estrogen like they give vitamins it used to be prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen seriously and it wasn t all that long ago how come it isn t get because then your body stops producing its like natural estrogen so good idea maybe any other poss nick any idea you can think of i don t know you re not producing enough so because you re not we should get more well how come have anybody heard of anything that s related to estrogen therapy bad things facial hair growth well testosterone can increase facial hair growth someone else over here cancer cancer and that s the problem they saw incidences of particularly breast cancer went up substantially and so that s why artie they re saying that you know hormone replacement it s still being used it s rarely used yeah but not like it used to be not like it used to be so if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly or blasts to work properly then shouldn t you like have like some sort of treatment to like make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts we would have like sort of a difference in their relationship good idea but isn t that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone so shouldn t we find a way to like make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they re stimulated but they have to be stimulated so show me if you re looking for a way to stimulate them more than make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes no that would be more like a genetic thing cause your osteocytes your dna is like breaking down as you get older so it s like not it s like i don t know is it mutating when it gets older i don t know a lot about genetics but i know your dna kinda breaks down as you get older and so that makes your cells not as efficient so it might be more of a dna kinda thing where you have to engineer that dna wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you re like 78 as when you re 12 so it might be in like that area but i don t know a lot about that so yeah it s interesting where you can go with it all right you can take this because even artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat what were you saying about that i don t know maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland i don t know maybe it like produced too much i don t know the jaw bone and it reached the jawbone first and i thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to the rest of the body so which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines maybe that s why your jaw s if you release a lot of that hormone then it s building your jaw up and when you re building bone you get growing pains maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw maybe,1.0
okay now when we sang that music scale we were we were actually stepping up we were going from low to high and if you ll look over at this you can tell these were the notes that we were singing from low to high the first note was a line note let s speak it together line note space note line note space note line note space note line note space note good job those notes were stepping and if you ll notice here i ve got carpet squares and i have them with line note and space note line note space note line note space note line note space note good job that s what we sang when we sang our scale and that s the notes that you re seeing up there are those line notes and those space notes all right i d like for us will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it sit behind the carpet square of your choice and let s go ahead and sit up tall on our knees sit nice and tall on your knees and the next person come in and find a carpet square sit behind it behind that hand chimes and i don t think we ll need we ll need one more person the next person what about me five good job all right now everyone even if you re sitting in your chairs you need to practice with me because we re all going to be playing the hand chimes today do not touch your hand chime just yet let s all just practice start off with your hand up put your hand chime down a second we re going to just practice with our arm only and it s going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that s going to make a difference in the way that it sounds all right watching me hold and again hold hold asanti hold hold okay stop now people down here pick up your hand chime and let s see if we can get that technique going get ready one more time good now let s just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop good now when i point to each person by yourself you will play the music scale so do not play until i point to you looking at me we begin start with the low c good job let s do it again that s the scale and these notes are stepping because it s line note space note line note space note any time you ve got two notes beside of each other that s a stepping melody one more time starting with the lowest c good job now put your hand chime down a second we just heard a stepping melody any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other two neighbors playing that s a stepping melody i want you to stand up please and i d like for you to stand up take your hand chime hold it and that melody someone raise your hand and tell me what did it do logan skipping actually it leaped you re exactly right it leaped because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play that s a leaping melody good job london do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping i mean leaping and skipping can somebody help us what s the difference between a leap and a skip if you leap it s more than a skip all right the leaping is more than the skipping skipping all right you sit down put the hand chime down and you stand up you keep remaining standing take your hand chime and you play that was a skip you are exactly right that s a skip when you just skip over one place one person all right have a seat you have a seat and i d like for ashley you stand up and what i want her to do is for four times i d like you to play your hand chime watching me i m going to let her try someone raise your hand what was that james what was that repeating you re exactly right that was a repeating note the one person that one pitch played four times all right sit down please now will you please stand you stand and you stand watching me all right raise your hand please tell me what was that devon stepping a stepping pattern and it went from high to low you re exactly right have a seat now last week i gave you a piece of paper and it was something that i wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping stepping and repeating on the music scale if you ll look over at the smartboard there is some notes there on number 1 some notes on number 1 and you were last week going to circle an s if it was a stepping pattern you were going to circle an r if it was a repeating pattern raise your hand if you know what those notes on number 1 were doing christian put your hand chime down and you can come up and circle whether those notes in the number 1 if they were stepping or if they were repeating you re exactly right christian how did you know that it was staying on the same note staying on the same note very good and thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes number 2 akrista can you walk around that other way and come right here and why don t you show us put the hand chime down please show us what the notes in number 2 are doing let s see if it s doing a space note and then a what line note line note and then a space note and she is exactly right those notes were stepping what down down and number 3 thank you ma am come this way right around here and she s looking at those music notes and she s going to be able to tell they re right here number 3 all right let s say it with her line note space note line note space note line note right here are they staying all the same no they staying all the same what are those notes doing they re stepping you re exactly right they re stepping up thank you ma am and tiptoe back to your seat very good job now i would like for the last two people b and c if you ll tiptoe to your seat i m going to call you back up here in a few minutes the rest of the folks you ve got to be sitting up nice and tall sit up tall on your knees let s see if they can play a very familiar tune i want you looking at the very first note the the very first note keiani you have that low c and what do you notice about c c keiani what s your note going to be doing what s the word when you have the same pitch re peating thank you he has a repeating note and g christian what are you going to be doing repeating repeating adam what are you going to be doing repeating repeating so we have a lot of repeating notes in this song sit up tall on your knees sit up tall pick your hand chime up we re going to see if we can play this familiar tune waiting one two ready sound very good that was twinkle twinkle little star it was twinkle twinkle little star you recognized it all right put your hand chime down a second i was listening you heard the melody all right now let me see sitting tall i m going to get someone that s sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit i think i would like for christopher will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody oh don t raise your hand we ll let christian choose three people that would be able to play christopher oh yeah christopher or you can call him chris that s christian all right tell me which three people just point to them all right he s pointing to you stand up with your hand chime we re talking about stepping now stepping all right okay chris has pointed to these three tapped them on the shoulder let s see if you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern will you just gives a thumbs up silently you re exactly right he did pick he did it he did pick three all right put your hand chime down and sit down i d like to call on harmony will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody leaping so you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder leaping leaping leaping okay now these two people are side by side there s a line note and a space note and they re neighbors someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play what would they be playing if they re neighbors that would be a stepping and i wanted a leap like a frog leaps over a whole lot so come and see if you can fix it real quick somebody needs to sit down who do you want to sit down all right sit down and pick somebody that will be a leaping melody like a frog leaping leaps over a whole lot all right he stands take your hand chime play now she leaped over a space note and a line note give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly yes that is a leaping melody good all right sit down hand chimes still on the floor i d like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair what we did in that song we had several times that there was repeating notes we had a few times where we had some stepping side by side and we had some leaping melodies when we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies the melody if you re playing a xylophone though you could do it right by yourself i can i would like keiani will you step around behind here and sheridan you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose and dev devuan devuan walk around here walk this way and he s going to be the teacher i want you to choose sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do choose something that you want them to play and let them see it turn it so that they can see it all right what do you want them to play step play a stepping melody all right good and stop now someone both of them did do a stepping melody but he was playing right here can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better a hit in the middle he says hit it in the middle hit where the music notes are those steps let s try it again play em soft great job that is stepping all right choose another one oh now he wants a leap good job what do you want devon devuan devuan repeat good job all right thank you put your mallet right there on the instrument lay it on the top that will be quicker for today and tiptoe back to your seat walking around the instruments i d like for wes h to step around and find yourself a xylophone step around over here akrista sit down tall on your knees and what do you want them to play tell them she wants you to play a repeating note now those were both kind of high repeating notes very high do you think you could play a low one good job now how did you know that was going to be low akrista cause the little ones are higher bigger ones are low you are exactly right what else do you want them to do she d like a what,1.0
our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column what i learned in the kwl chart okay so that s our goal our goal is to find the answers to draw a conclusion to our month long experiment before we do that why don t we take another measurement i would like you to measure your plant if you have any and i would like you to count the number of leaves on your plant on one of them go ahead scientists take your ruler take your ruler and measure i like the way some of you are holding your rulers it s great that you put the lower number down when you measure great if it helps you can pick up your plant okay after you have your measurement and the number of leaves make sure you count the numbers the leaves too you may put your plant down after you put your plant down i know you are ready to continue could you touch your head with your empty hands good job john touch your head with your empty hands wonderful i see that you re ready right katie put your hands down i also took pictures of your experiment your pictures will serve as data that means the information you collected this group picture were from the people who conducted the experiment to see if seeds would grow with soil water and sunlight sunlight we have air all around us so we all have air i would like you to use good listening ears day one day 11 that s what it looked like day 18 day 24 and day 32 we even have a ruler here a primary ruler that s easy for kindergartners to use now looking at the data and your pictures what do you think the conclusion is if you did this experiment if you planted the seeds you planted your seeds with soil water and sunlight could you please raise your hand good we have some eager participants could you please come up here with your experiment and a ruler and explain to us my experiment was if plants will grow with sun soil and water and i put them near the windowsill why did you put your cup near the windowsill to get some sunlight so your seeds received sunlight did you water your seeds yes i did okay and you did put soil yes in the cup okay what do you think your conclusion is if plants will grow in sun soil and water and what is your answer um did your seeds grow yes did you take a measurement yeah may we see how tall they are how tall are they one inch did you see how kieran measured his plants he has the end with the lower number touching the base of the plant that s good scientist now how many leaves do you have on some of them four leaves and how many did you have last week two two so what do you think is happening they re growing they re growing because you have more leaves wonderful great job scientist and now let s look at the next experiment boys and girls this one is planting seeds without water did seeds or plants grow without water i would like you to look at the data this is your data just in case you don t remember sometimes we don t remember what we did but pictures help us day one day 11 day 18 day 24 day 32 hmmm i wonder what the conclusion is oh john you want to come up and share great take your experiment and your ruler and i really love the way thalia listened my experiment was if plants will grow without water and i put sun soil i gave it sun and i put soil and i never gave it water how did you give it sunlight i put it by the windowsill okay so what is your conclusion my conclusion is plants will grow without water will grow or won t grow won t grow very good thank you thank you very much young scientist great job and let s look at the next experiment did seeds grow without soil here s day one again scientists look at the smart board day 11 day 18 and day 32 now who did this experiment we would like you come on up rachel bring up your experiment and tell us all about it i did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil and i put seeds water in it and i put it by the window and i gave it sun and they didn t grow what did you not use soil you did not use soil and where are your seeds by the window they re in your cup right now in my cup uh huh would you mind showing the class what you have there tilt it down boys and girls take a peek this is what rachel s seeds i can t see okay so now what is your conclusion rachel seeds won t grow without soil very good thank you scientist we have nothing to measure in rachel s cup and the last one oh boys and girls this is a very interesting one i really would like you to look up here look at the data first did seeds or plants grow without sunlight a lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight but look at this one day one do you have anything no no day 11 no day 18 look at the number look at the numbers on the ruler day 24 i want you to look at your data and day 32 well that s some interesting experiment i know some of you did this one quite a number of children if you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like come on up okay john you re going to show juliana what a good listener you are okay go ahead buddy i planted seeds without sun and i put them in the closet did you cover your seeds with soil yes so your seeds have soil soil you watered them watered them every week you watered them and and no sun and you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in the closet in the closet and the closet has no sun has no sunlight it has no windows right john now juliana tell the class if you ever had any sprouts i did have sprouts and what do you think happened they died how tall were your sprouts at one point one inch one inch and why do you think they died because they had no sun and do you think the sun is important for plants to grow so what is your conclusion no seeds won t grow without sun very good good job scientist you may go back now boys and girls i m going to ask you to think about your experiment think about what your question was what you wanted to find out and the steps you took to do your experiment and you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out you may say what was your question or what do you want to find out and here s a big question mark and after your partner answers then you may ask what did you do what steps did you take and at the end we will like you to ask your partner what is your answer how did you know that s the answer they have to tell you their evidence what they used to tell you the answer okay now turn to your partner and talk to each other remember how we work as partners what did you find out what was your question my question was take turns gabby take turns boys and girls let s take 30 more seconds if you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free okay boys and girls turn around please put your hands on your lap so i can see your empty hands alright let s look at the answers again our whole experiment and let s look at the questions will seeds grow without water what do you think no if you don t think seeds will grow without water shake your head great cameron will seeds grow without water no no good okay next question will seeds grow without sunlight no let me see you touch your ears if you don t think seeds will grow without sunlight okay let s see will they cameron no touch your ears so i know you understand next one will seeds grow without soil yes or no yes no will seeds grow without soil no no touch the ground touch the rug okay great the last question katie is will seeds grow with water sun and soil yes good then make some rain drops make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil,1.0
until i say switch so you stay at your center when you are finished when i say switch you may go to the next center okay all right so here are different centers you know where you go you may go to your center and you may begin let s go back again let s make sure we re pushing there you go 14 14 14 where should we start them good job nice job where do you think we should start our cubes when we re gonna measure here yeah because we wanna line it up where it starts good nathan used more force to do it right nathan used a little bit more force than you didn t he so when you used more force what did that do it made it go farther it made it go farther good job all right guys if you are done put your thumbs up if you are still working raise your hand in the air okay i m gonna give you about one more minute to finish up all right how did it go okay very nice where should we start it now if we re measuring where do we need to start the cube nice job all right i want you to stop what you re doing you need to pick up your clipboard and your pencil and you need to switch leave the cubes and the pucks at the station clipboards pencils and switch we have no puck over here here it is have an idea for you okay hold on a second let s go down the list i want you to come back put that away i saw teddy go like this and put his fingers here and go up why did you do that teddy where it was but when he marks the paper there he needs to really leave it there and then push the other ones up and i need someone else to come over here and measure now we knew it was 10 here what are we gonna count next what comes after 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 15 okay go ahead and record that how do we know when it s supposed to be a okay so whose turn is this one mine where do you need to start lining it up 50 15 50 50 so if we did 10 what comes after 10 11 12 13 14 14 right there nice job all right stop what you re doing i want you to go ahead pick up your clipboard and your pencils and you may switch let me do it can i ask a question sure what would you like to ask me all right okay that s a good question all right who s gonna go next in this group okay why don t you hold on one second can you move over a little bit get behind it and push it 11 12 13 14 15 yeah i did what do you notice about those two numbers oh it s two 19 s i think amber might get the 19 you think she might get 19 no she didn t do you wanna try pushing it again here start behind nice job all right guys go ahead and switch one more time take your pencil and your clipboard you can go first okay guys let s get our pencil so that we know exactly where it is right here okay so now go ahead and count so what did you come up with 13 13 good job let s turn the clipboard around so you can three backwards 35 whoa all right now whose turn is it damonte s turn go ahead damonte now where do we need to start counting right here can you give him some tips where do you think he should start counting right here okay and why the line that s where the tape begins right or you could even go like this and start it at the tape and then you use your pencil so where does the pencil stop right here okay so then count to there i ll hold it for you you count 10 ben what do you think can you help him seven so ben thought that he got seven yeah it s seven okay so we re gonna stop where the thing begins so we re gonna stop at the seven okay here you go good job okay i want you to stop what you re doing i want you to quickly come to the carpet with your pencil and your clipboard come to your circle spot i m gonna count down from five i want you to be on the carpet at zero five four three two one and zero i love how you guys get to the carpet so nice and quietly thank you give yourself a pat on the back for doing a really good job now i wanna know what you noticed about using the different surfaces what did you notice about the tile what did you notice about the wood what did you notice about the cloth and what did you notice about the carpet sophia i noticed that the cloth and the carpet was harder it was harder and so what do you think happened the puck slowed down the puck slowed down what made it slow down the bumps on the towel the bumps on the towel and when we watched that video that talked about the bumps do you remember what they called that what is it that causes those bumps nathaniel it pushes back it does it pushes it back what s that big word that we ve been talking about friction friction so do you think there was more friction on the towel not when i did it okay so monalisa share what you noticed when i pushed mine it went all the way down it went all the way down so which one had more friction when you were testing it which one slowed down or did not go as far which surface was slower do you remember the carpet the carpet so the carpet for you had the most friction okay so does anyone else wanna talk about their surface kayley the cloth when i pushed the puck it went kind of far but not really far because of all the bumps which surface had the least amount of friction daniel wood the wood give me a thumbs up if the wood was also the one with the least amount of friction good job,1.0
anybody tell me how much cases usually run at radio shack they re 30 dollars okay you know what so we ll factor that in in a minute but alex you had your hand raised so i d like to hear from you i was just gonna say that the 199 tax is gonna come in anyway so what if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping okay hold up cynthia but even though even though if you use 12 you re only gonna have a couple dollars left over with the economy these days things are not cheap so you can t buy something with five dollars you re not gonna get a case for that cheap that s probably right i m gonna hear two more of you and then i have something i wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about and i think is really important to point out so i wanna hear what you two have to say and then i m gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned go ahead it s better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to then you d still have zero dollars left but it s better to have equal or more money okay that s you know i think you re right that seems like it just makes sense right and one more yeah actually when i bought my phone i got a case just for about five dollars on ebay ebay so you got a used one and it paid for shipping so i didn t yes i did okay well you know what i wanna talk about that because that s actually what you guys just said is really important and several of you others mentioned it maybe we don t want maybe i don t want to have the exactly the price maybe i want to have at least and if i say i wanna have at least 200 dollars is there a way to say at least with math symbols to make that equation change so it says least cause right now it says equal is there a way to do it so it says at least colin if you you need to get the iphone and the case in the same shipping order or else it s gonna cost more for shipping oh okay so yeah i need at least a certain amount yeah so you re gonna wanna jump in on that guys you need to put the greater than or equal to sign but what does that look like the greater than sign with a line under it okay and what s the word in english that we have for that symbol yeah say it again alexis that least it is so now how much do i need to save to get at least 200 dollars right so it s okay if i have exactly or more than so that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about maybe i need more money if she wants more more than just a phone i m sure she does right with the what about the just come with the phone just that or does it come with something else like a charger battery or even a case itself so again you re saying i need at least 200 dollars right depending on what comes with the phone like a christmas special like half off or something what you can also think is where you gonna buy it and where is there s no tax and stuff so it depends on where you re gonna buy it if you want no tax that means like on ebay or something but it might be 50 percent off and stuff like that okay interesting i m just saying it depends where you re gonna buy your phone okay no i like that a lot when i was doing my equation i got 121 so you would still have a dollar left over and you know how cassidy said that she can get it on ebay that much most people they i understand that it s cheap and most people want it like that but i bought stuff off the line before and some of the stuff does work good and some of em you drop them and it breaks so it s not always good somethin to pay attention to all right i m gonna change the conversation a little bit because i think you guys are doing really really well let s go with what you guys said and say i need at least 200 dollars if that s true is there any way to find out or to answer the original question which nick brought up how much money do i need to save each day based on what we have so far where do i go from here there is a way to solve it you grab 200 dollars and then you subtract 80 from it okay i m gonna stop you right there i don t mean to interrupt katherine you re watching this and i saw your paper what do you think about what najeem just said like okay and why is that i don t know that s how you solve it in equality okay so can you repeat what you said you subtract 80 from both sides okay i m gonna go ahead and do that right now and what does that leave us with 120 and you know what i have a question what does that 120 represent i mean if 200 is how much the phone costs what s 120 about i m not sure how much you need to raise until then okay okay and nayanna can you comment on what you think might be the next step divide 12 from 120 again divide 12 from 120 okay and somebody else jump in the answer was the answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10 okay and katie you were ready to say something what would you say i was about to say equals 10 x equals 10 and x equals at least 10 oh it was so you re not liking what i wrote over here alexis at least cause you have to keep the all the way down okay katherine what do you think i agree with alexis because it can t just like change because when you say it can t change what do you mean the side oh okay that s good i didn t know what it was i m just asking and then you have to put what x means oh oh oh so what is the label what are the units we re talkin about ah the blue tooth if you wanna have a little extra money you could have more and plus if you get a little extra money one day but you have the same another and you get a little less the next day you could raise up for another day oh like if i m going to collect cans and i don t collect as many cans one day but i collect extra the next day yeah like that nayanna you had your hand raised when you have to add 40 to 200 for the bluetooth ah that s an interesting idea so maybe we so tell me what to write instead of this how would you change this to incorporate what you just said 80 plus x equals 240 okay are you pleased are you okay with that i disagree cynthia i disagree with your answer on that one i don t agree that it s 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money you would you should you should do 11 for a day because if you do you ll get 132 and then you ll have extra money okay but that s the problem what do you mean when you say it s not asking well it s not asking for extra money or anything it s just asking how many how much money you need per day anthony i noticed you ve got some stuff written down what do you think about i wanna go back to what nayanna said she says she s gonna change the equation here and she put 240 up there why why did she do that and do you agree with that yeah cause then you would have a little extra money left a little bit you would have a little bit of extra money left okay like the bluetooth in the case maybe okay isn t this another problem another problem not a part of this one yet yeah cause they re not asking how much extra money do you need this problem this question s not asking how much extra do you need for a bluetooth also okay how much are the phone and bluetooth it s just asking for the phone okay i think because the question wasn t asking to bring extra money into it we just brought the extra money to round the make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay but we shouldn t change the equation cause it s not asking you to okay this question isn t saying anything about case or a bluetooth yet it s a yes question and this question talks about bluetooth okay so what i kinda like is you guys were doin this problem and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem which is no problem at all let s jump ahead just for a minute and assume that i did want to get the bluetooth would this be the equation to represent and before i answer this question what i would like to do i m gonna call on olivia and then i m gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co pilots and the pilots come up but not yet let s hear what olivia has to say would it be equals 12 x if you wanted to get it before christmas or would it be after one more time i could barely hear ya would we still get that before christmas or would it be after before before so would it be 12 comments on that i agree with that thumbs up if you think 12 thumbs down if you think no we don t need 12 on this one okay adrian you have something we need to know how much money you earned each day well that s what do you guys think about that question well that s what we re finding out right now i know but how much you earn that s how much he has to save pilots switch with somebody in the back all right here we go so now i have a question for you can everybody turn around for just a minute please thank you question for you if i wanted to graph our first solution on a number line what might that graph look like so will you guys agree that okay we need to earn a minimum amount and at least 10 dollars a day but if i wanted to graph that put that on a number line represent that graphically what would that look like it would be like a it would be but the circle what kind of circle i didn t hear you shaded so you want to put this up here yeah amarra i d like to hear your opinion on that i don t i never understood the shaded thing i don t know why it s shaded it s shaded because it s not i think if it s not shaded it means greater than i mean greater or less than but when it s shaded i think it means equal to or less than or with okay tara do you wanna contribute to that well whenever it says greater than or equal to the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to or greater than which is over 10 but greater than or less than can t be that number so it has to be open circle and than greater than or equal to anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle unshaded circle in real life what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle go ahead al fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils a little louder i got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils so in that problem could 14 students have mechanical pencils if you have fewer than 14 no so that would be unshaded cause 14 doesn t count so in this question amarra the least number of money i should save per day is how much i think 10 is a good answer because it does go into the number and so would be shaded or unshaded shaded oh is that the only number amount of money i should save each day is that it are their other possibilities out yeah you could do,1.0
does everyone agree on the first question yeah what did you all agree on that it wasn t really fair for for first and second class to go through without any problems and the people from the steerage had to go through examinations and this whole long hassle and why was that why did people who were first and second class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations cause of the money what about the money because they thought that they had they were perfect they had no disease they had lots of money and thought they would work hard so the stereotype is what that rich people are more can work harder or have less chance of disease than the people in steerage do you think that that stereotype is still true today or do you think it s not true anymore it was just for first and second class passengers for steerage passengers before emigrating well it s kind of like this it s not over the top but it s just a little bit what do you guys think about what eric said i agree with him why it s not fair because first and second class usually are kings or royalty and so if you re in steerage you re just a normal person if you re in steerage it s not going to be fair you have to go walk through that and well first and second class passengers they weren t necessarily royalty they were just people who had a lot of money people who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive what do you guys think about what eric said that the stereotype today is still here but not really just kind of back and forth it s back and forth they don t do the same thing anymore who s they and what s the same thing the american embassy the people that take care of the immigrants and everything and all about them they don t go to ellis island anymore they don t go to ellis island anymore you have to go on a plane or you have to drive here but do you think the stereotype in general that rich people are better or they don t have diseases and they re just better than people who don t have a lot of money do you think we still have those stereotypes today sometimes sometimes have you seen it ever no no but you just think it s still there i haven t really seen it at all yeah i agree with okay you can start the next one hold on josh did you have something else to add yeah on tv shows sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes and they re usually pretty snotty and how do you know they re snotty they re always like don t touch that it s going to fall and you re going to pay for that oh okay so you do see in tv sometimes yeah all right do you think immigrants were treated fairly at ellis island why or why not i don t think they were treated very fairly because they had to go through i agree with jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at ellis island but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in america yeah and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay some of the doctors two people could have the same diseases but both the doctors one doctor could send one person home and one person could stay at ellis island which is unfair possibly because of their religion or the way their language i think they were mostly i think they were mostly yeah so they were mostly treated well but sometimes not sometimes not yeah the doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back and remember the book that we read it kind of said that the cousin he had to be sent back to well he almost had to be sent back to his country because to russia yeah to russia because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected his father was trying to tell him but they didn t listen yeah he didn t i think they should have translators with all of them so then it would make it fair that spoke english and that language that language so they can understand things so i would say mostly yeah mostly so should we check them both off i think we should check off the first one if they were sick or something or if they needed food they had places where they could get food or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital like sophia said so i m in the middle kind of because sometimes they were treated badly i agree with josh because if they were sick they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases like oh get away from me because you re going to spread that disease to everybody it s going to be an epidemic i want to add if they were sick they could have been contagious and there were a lot of people at ellis island so they might have usually if they were at a hospital they were curing curable diseases because if they couldn t cure it they didn t have a medicine or anything to cure that they got sent back yeah i agree with eric and sophia go ahead were you going to say something i was going to say if we all agree on this so your general feeling here is were they treated fairly at ellis island they weren t treated not very fairly like they were treated half the fair that they should have been but they weren t treated really good they were fed very well and all their needs were there but they weren t treated very good like if you were on an airplane in first class it s kind of like i would like to add they were treated way better in ellis island because on the ship in steerage they didn t have good food they couldn t really bathe and it was all crowded they didn t really have a good place to sleep but in ellis island they actually had okay food they weren t treated like do you think that it was fair that they each had to have 20 on them in order to stay yeah sort of sort of what i think is they need to take care of themselves and america is actually bringing lots of them over here america just could say stop no more immigrants at all but they ve been letting people in a lot of people in and they ve been very generous by giving them food and letting them live here in this wonderful country so they ve provided enough i have something i have two things to say i agree with sophia because i sort of agree with sophia because if they didn t have 20 they wouldn t have much to live and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants they re responsible for themselves they re on their own and i would like to say is that going back to sophia s it said that then they were fed well and that they were all wanted to get to america and even if some of them had money how do you know that they didn t have a disease or something how do you know if they didn t have lice or something i kind of agree with you because if they paid more i think they shouldn t get a lot a lot more but i think they should get a little bit more but they still should go to ellis island yeah sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships and kind of gave the medical exams to first and second class passengers to make sure they didn t have any diseases and then if their medical exams checked out fine then they could skip everything else so they didn t have to get asked all those questions and they didn t have to wait in all those long lines and things like that so what do you think about that i think it s still unfair that they didn t have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat i think instead of ellis island they should have checked them before they got on the boat for everyone yeah i agree with you i think they got all seasick think that s where they all got sick yeah like in the steerage some of them got sick because they were in steerage and then when they got to ellis island they had to get sent back the reason why some of them got sick was because they didn t have fresh air and so they couldn t breathe that well stuffy in steerage i think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don t like them for their religion and stuff could doctors send people back because they didn t like their religion doctors could send people back why doctors couldn t send people back but they would mark letters on your back why could they mark letters on your back because they probably thought they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch so just if you were hurt and then they had to go through further medical exams to see but doctors couldn t just say i don t like you you have to go back they were just examining you to make sure you didn t have a contagious disease that could get other people sick when we were reading they said something about the doctors where they didn t have any diseases or anything but they d still send them back and you read that in the book we were reading one of the things oh and why would they send them back why would they get sent back by the legal inspectors and other people sometimes it was like there were random reasons they sent them just because yeah that s not fair that s what you re saying yeah i d also change the part where they had to why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes yeah i mean they should have given a sheet or something or something because what if that s the only thing they had you know i think they should mark on their skin or something so then you could just wash it off like a marker or something no i don t think they should do it on the skin because then if there was a water fountain they could just wash it off and say i m in this line right true they could they could do that we all agree they should do something other than your own clothes they should give you a sheet of paper and you could rip it apart i think that they way they did it for example that guy in the book did his jacket inside out they should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them because someone could just say take this jacket inside out and then go into the other line or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow yeah oh i don t have a jacket yeah yeah if we didn t have ellis island not as many immigrants would be here probably because it d be a lot harder and ellis island they fed you food it was good i like it i agree with josh because they gave you food and water a place to sleep they built stuff and made kinder cares and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown ups the people that were there at ellis island didn t even have to pay for any of that that was all for free i mean imagine that happening to us right now that will never happen i definitely agree with sophia because if you just come to ellis island and they just give you potato soup every meal it s kind of like they don t get a good impression of america i think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on america from giving them good food and a good way to start their time in america and then they realize how complicated it is yeah according to everyone i kind of agree it was good i think,1.0
inner circle number two again this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we re going with this why did the accident happen the accident of may 10th 1996 why did it happen any questions yes the may 10th 1996 thank you for clarifying where everybody died well not everybody but a lot of people died why did it happen because okay so i think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren t prepared for for the climb they thought it was going to be they re just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn t expect the challenges that they were going to face i agree they probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park turns out that they weren t ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain you were talking about they weren t prepared and all that but they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn t normal and i was kind of taken aback by that because i was like if there s a guide who s going to be guiding me on a life threatening thing i would want them to be seasoned trainer you know exactly i would think the same thing that the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew i agree with all of you but during reading the article krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn t really anyone s fault because people were so not in their right minds they were tired and injuries and how thin the air was they couldn t breath very well so when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming they didn t expect it to be as bas as it was so nobody could really prevent it anything to add to that i agree and i think that they were just having so much fun that they weren t really paying attention i think that they would ve all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds i know you mentioned the clouds but why weren t they watching them why do you think they weren t watching them they didn t think that they were actually serious enough to actually i agree with matt that they were so they wanted to get to the top so much they weren t too worried about looking at the clouds oh okay we can make it back up and make it back down maybe before not expecting trouble along the way yeah i agree i think that they weren t really prepared they were too wrapped up in what was going on to think about the downfall and what was happening they re tired and probably weak they didn t have safe they weren t really all there to think about what are the consequences of this and what would happen like the guide if it were me i would have made sure they had this that you re gonna help me out more than not really being able to anything you wanna say krystin well i said that this quote at the top it says that ambition has a steep price and i think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren t too prepared and weren t qualified but i think that well and the author mentions this too that climbing this mountian is it s taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when you re putting your life on the line there s nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive it s just basically putting your life to chance and so that s what i really got out of it what do you think i agree i think that then not as many people would ve died they should just listen to what they re told and and not risk their lives to do something that i agree with that no but i think that what krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and i agree but i think it s understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely cool and i would definitely want to go up there soon as possible and not worry about the weather like go all in or don t go at all i agree with lost or injured i mean but i m like half way there go ahead and accomplish what i set out to do and i think that would ve caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we re doing i agree with what ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at mount everest i mean it says that they caught about safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life one thing i noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn t go back and check themselves and i didn t understand why they didn t go back and and like when the one guy says there s no oxygen here there s no full tanks why didn t they go back and check that themselves i mean i would trust that person but yet again if my life on the line i would be checking it does anyone else think the same way if my life were at risk i wouldn t be relying too much on other if my life were at risk i wouldn t be relying too much on other people i d be a little weary about something like that i don t so much disagree but i came up with something a little bit different i didn t really think that people relied on each other that much at all who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain in a way i would say that it was selfish mission but in another way i mean if it was my own life i would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and i think we saw that at least i saw that a lot happen throughout the story it s a choice between am i going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this does it matter or am i going to get down this mountain and survive some people were relying on others like at the end someone was trying to help was trying to help he tried to help her down she grabbed his arm and he tried to pull her down but she just let go and died i agree with erin too i mean i think that right now wouldn t be able to you would think about yourself more whenever you re out there and and you re with the same people for that long of a time and you re doing the same thing that you become sort of closer they would mean more to you then than they do right now you d be more willing to sacrifice something to survive to help them give them another chance to get out alive too that s definitely shown at the end of the article when he s talking about how he can t live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost and how he couldn t even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time i agree with erin i think there was a lot of at the end i think he was talking about the there was a lot of blame involved and why couldn t we prevent this and it brings me back to what you guys said i think they really wanted to help each other and i think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases i thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn t prevent someone s terrible death tyler what do you think about this like did he grieve or even just the fact that who they were relying on well what strikes me all right outer circle what d you notice what d you notice i noticed that people were and books and just kind of in inner circle and i felt that that really helped them to get the instructions okay blake what did you notice i just thought that it was more and more like erin really led the conversation and krystin really led the conversation and i think that those were like the two main ones but like levi and elliot and alex they all also communicated a lot but there wasn t just one person who was talking okay so there were definitely two leaders but there were other people that were contributing as they went along okay good anthony there were some well developed conversations well developed conversations what do you mean by that like erin would say something and someone would build on it then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic yeah did you notice what was the question they started with yeah we got a little off topic no you didn t what what was the question you started with what caused the disaster and then you went into something totally different but did you have good conversation about that absolutely you guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life okay i really like how i mean it wasn t like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing mount everest it was definitely very connected to what you were saying dorothy what d you notice i noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn t stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another right it kept bouncing from one thing to another you could see like steam coming out of your ears they were all impulsive blake i thought that also remember erin said you re relying on someone and krystin s like well i don t agree backed up erin and other people backed up krystin and there was people who didn t yeah is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you absolutely but you need to do it respectfully like krystin did krystin said i don t exactly agree with you erin then she proceeded to say why and levi was over here he was nodding his head and shaking yeah all right great i thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses they always had something someone would pass on to someone else they paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses you guys ever heard that before it wasn t a pregnant pause it wasn t a big spacey gap okay anthony pretty much everyone talked pretty much everyone talked yeah pretty much yeah did you notice that they built on to what other people were saying okay they agreed i still heard i agree a lot but then they told us why they agree with what they said all right anything else you guys noticed yes i think that we looked at our more because they had wider subject that they talked about eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details it wasn t the whole story it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that all right anything else,1.0
are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90 no so you won t have any complementary to worry about is that supplementary though you will have supplementary right you re not gonna have to worry about the outside you re just gonna look at your inside when you measure your angles you ll be able to see supplementary yeah then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why we re supposed to draw a line well i want you to see what s congruent sides now you dont have to measure all your sides because have these so you ve got the same colors so they re all the same you re don t have to do angles kinda figure out ok so they re all 90 degrees one of yours looks 90 so you know they re 90s so you got for the outside of your figure you got some a little bit easier work yeah ok so you need to explain why things are 90 and what are congruent and then you re gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there then you ll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles so you know a lot about a square to start with yeah the equal sides have to be congruent and certain sides so write that then measure those angles and segments and see if you can t find some more rules that go with a square oh ok so yes your first set of rules for the first page from here you know a lot you know that any point and what they are you know you have equal sides then you don t have to measure these sides because you used the same color so you can explain it using the colors so you got a lot you know from the first part but then when you draw your diagonals here you re gonna have to measure your pieces see what happens to these angles see what happens to these diagonals and then see if you can t come up with some rules you re main part here you know a lot but now when we do this this will some of the new ok square is the last one that we teach so you will be the last group up there today right we re trying to get these rules today you can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there yeah there s just three of you ok how you doing good what do you notice about some of these corresponding is what i got here down here these are supplementary supplementary because they re what type of angles help him respond well there are options focus on one if we were to look at if i was continuing these lines here they re gonna be same side interior obviously yes so they re not quite supplementary so you might need to go back and do it again sammy knows they need to be supplementary same side interior somehow your measurements didn t get there so go back and try to remeasure you realize you wrote the error that s good so you re using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error yeah so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day when you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way you read 122 when it s going this way it s 118 so what you did is you read this way when you re going this way you said 122 when it s between 120 and 110 at least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it you said it was only off by one degree any amount then again to then explain your rules now what s congruent what s supplementary and then explain why like you were saying same side interior that s what you ll have yes do you have chester marlin yes i do please send him to the office ok what you did was perfect because they re same side interior so you would say this would you say equal angle one and angle four that d be fine because you can go ahead and when you re teaching it you can label those angles and that would be a really good way to do it so it s like angle one and angle four are same side interior same side interior so that has to equal 180 ok bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there your second page when you redraw the figure you re gonna draw the diagonals you re gonna see your diagonals cut each other you re gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half i ll be to ashley then at brandon s group in just a minute so make sure your congruent sides you don t have to measure your sides if you use your colors you can use colors to explain it so yeah you re exactly on the right track here we re just gonna draw the same figure draw those diagonals in there and then we got a little bit some more things you might see bisectors you might not some figures you do and some you don t all right ok it s up to you i love the way you put your letters there so you re getting really good with your letters you can say since you only have one angle at each letter you can say angle j or angle h however you want to do that could we just put supplementary and draw a little diagonal like that that d be fine actually do all these and you ve got your congruent and your angles then you re gonna redraw the same thing over here put your diagonals in and measure again when you put diagonals in you might see some that bisect the angles or bisect segments you might not but that s what you re looking for so this is gonna be well the diagonals we re not gonna draw one of them oh we re not no we re just gonna look at our diagonals otherwise you re breaking it into two other figures and that s a possibility but you don t have to i love the way that you ve lettered it here you re using those correct terms that ll be really good as you go up there all right brandon what all did we mess up so far let s see well it s a four sided figure what should a four sided figure add up to 360 360 does it no it s a little more than 360 so you might need to change things a little bit to remeasure it and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360 there s some that i see really right away that s good it s like 370 ok so you re gonna try to make it work you know you need to make it work you know it s gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better can we just add one here and add two there well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are but one good thing you see you see that these angles are the same which is something you re supposed to come up with which is good now if i was giving this when you re up there explaining it you need a way to explain and i know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent and in your picture that s good but sometimes let s think for a minute if i gave you write them out yeah it may always be the obtuse angle so here yeah that s what i was thinking if you were to do it this way the angles that are congruent aren t necessarily the obtuse ones so what you ve found is good but in your picture it is the obtuse ones but if you can see as you move that it doesn t have to be the obtuse ones let s look at a way we can describe you re saying that these two angles are congruent which is correct so instead of saying obtuse how can i explain that these two and not those two what s the difference between these two angles and those two angles they re 45 degrees well it didn t have to be it could be 45 it looks 45 if i was to do this it s not it s the short side s angles it s where your short sides meet your long sides so the angles with the non congruent sides or the short sides meet the long angles that would be perfect that would be a little better to explain it and even when you re up there explaining a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn t have to be and normally it s the bigger angles but it doesn t have to be draw diagonals that s right and you re gonna look for all the angles again when you draw your diagonals a lot of times you re gonna see bisectors like segments might bisect each other they might bisect angles they might or they might not so that s what you re looking for when you do that and then you re gonna kind of come up to we just draw them like this just like that that s right then you ll measure all of those angles and all of those segments we won t be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside because you won t have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals so you ll actually have to measure that part with a ruler but again you re not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else so that s what you ll do all right i ll be right back yes so are we supposed to do this you don t need the angles that are out there i mean you could but it s not necessary what should of course our figure add up to the angles inside uh huh 360 360 so make sure yours do what if they don t so i think if i was to look at your measurements here i know what i did i messed up i wrote these good perfect that s what i was gonna get to you read the wrong one and didn t notice all right i ll be right back how are you doing so you want to make some general rules so the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel i wouldn t really want to use the words top and bottom because what if you turn it this way yeah well a and b sides yeah so you re gonna do that so you ve got your pieces what do you notice about your angles you ve got the angles that are equal but what if i was looking for supplementary do you have any supplementary angles a and d a and d so you say a and d are supplementary what makes them supplementary what rule do we already know that was why they re supplementary they add up to 180 right they add up to 180 but are they same side interior angles same side interior angles so you can say they re 180 because they re same side interior angles then what you re gonna do you re gonna go to this page you re gonna draw your figure again but you ve got to draw your diagonals and measure the things when you draw the diagonals what you re really looking for is to see is there anything that cuts in half do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments some figures do some figures don t but that s what you re looking for so you re gonna redraw it draw your diagonals then measure you ll have more angles to measure you re actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won t match your diagonals correctly you re gonna have to actually do the measurements and see see if the segments are bisected see if the angles are bisected that s kind of what you re gonna come up with it may be it may not be some of the figures do and some don t ok i think i understand that we draw from angles to angles yeah from vertex to vertex that s right so make an x in the middle all right you re good yes i think we have about everything and then i think we have the other vertex angle bisectors they bisect the angle number five all the triangles are isosceles wow that s good i didn t think you d get that i m impressed he did it good job and then diagonals make a perpendicular perfect what i m gonna do is i m gonna give you another sheet make a bigger square,1.0
glue here we are compression is really compression is really getting it hey guys what ya doin adding our stuff to this oh i ve been trying to tell you that this bridge holds one kilogram without breaking a thousand grams wow that s really good that s probably why you want us to have a railing uh huh so it doesn t just slide off that s true you do want to keep something on the bridge well that s very good and we re thinking about it bends a lot so we could do this it s really bendy bendy and you just broke it don t break it the last time she just dropped it and it splattered all over the place okay so this is the roadway yes okay and then what s going to hold this up we re trying to figure out everything if we get all the pieces and then trying to see what we can do to add it all together do we have um wait a minute guys we could have one of the railings on the front and the bottom the top and bottom stick cause i was thinking we could put this on the bottom guys like if we had one on the top and bottom like on the movie it would hold it down and up at the same time keeping it flat hey you know what we could do we could make kind of like a t shape and then bend the top of the stick and then glue it on that way what would you glue that to you say you re bending it into a t shape okay so you d have a t shape go like okay try to bend that hand me a book we need to put more compression i learned by that idea if i put a book on it it would keep the glue down and it would keep it compressed we need more compression let s get a couple of books here s another one also put a kilogram on it yes you did put a kilogram on it that s true i mean like on there oh okay so this rail that you have over here that s a truss and as soon as we add this is that going to be under or above the railway we were deciding to go above cause it has to have a railing and then below is optional okay but how is it going to get attached we were trying to figure out that okay now we just keep going okay i will come back and check on you all right okay give me a couple popsicle sticks so i can put it underneath will we put them underneath the thing oh dang dang dang it s hard because these right here but only two places are touching oh i see what you mean i don t think it s overlapping because there s the one in between i was just making sure okay yeah i see what you re saying but i kinda think they work because this is really only touching this and here it touches this one but it s not like it s continuously touching from here to here i was just making sure sheesh you guys why don t you all tell me more about your bridge well it s kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge i mean beam bridge okay can you sit up we re continuing to make our arch but we have run into a problem okay we decided we re going to put glue on top of here to fill in some of the cracks that we had it would act like cement but we forgot that when glue dries it contracts so the bridge has kind of curled guys guys logan we re not in your group we re okay also i was thinking when we did the arch it might need support under the bottom but the triangle might be a little odd cause it would stand on this end part we could do what we did here can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be well i was thinking we could just like bend it and put it on that i m going to test this on the weights we need two kilograms if you can get it now how long is your bridge have you measured your bridge our bridge is are you doing it in metric or in customary we re doing it in customary customary okay it s 55 cm or 22 inches and 2 cm okay we re not going to mix measurements it s like 22 and a half inches okay so if you had 12 is that 12 plus 9 yeah so 21 and a half maybe yes okay you guys i got the two 200 kilogram things so we could gram i said gram 200 grams it will be heavier than the glue bottle and that way we can use the glue okay so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go the arch is going to be above the roadway no because here you can t fit two cars but it will go smoothly for the rest of it like we made it so two cars would go right next to each other like we didn t think we could leave the extra space right but they might take off each other s rear view mirrors right we ran into that though what could you do about that we don t really know because all of this stuff is dry so far it s holding up quite well well what if this was only one lane what if you made another one just like it to be the other lane that would be perfect but it would take a good long while no it wouldn t we built this in a couple of days yeah we could glue it together with like these yeah okay perfect thanks miss hoyle all right guys let s start working on that one so are these the same size as these let s try to make it more even this time making that is going to take like 50 days we need 50 of these guys right tell me a little bit about this arch and what it s going to do as you build the arch how is that going to keep your bridge steady well it s like when the arch gets pulled on it s gonna be secured here so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension it s going to go a little bit like it is now okay it s going to pull it away a little bit which means i ve got to get the weight on it so it s going to create the outward thrust yeah which with an outward thrust what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge if you have an outward thrust remember oh it s uh abutments do you remember that yeah you need that something over here to take the force the pressure that s being exerted from the center outward the outward thrust i have a thing with that one it hates me i hate it so have you tried laying your bridge across a 20 inch span yeah we did it on a desk it caved in a little in the middle but when our arched is finished it ll actually help tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle the important thing is what we did was we put glue in between in to act like cement to keep it together uh huh well that made it curl a little bit and so it was a little weaker in the middle because that s where it was starting to bend and also partially because it s it s we don t have a lot of support on the bottom which makes the um its tension affected i kind of suggested triangles at the bottom but we haven t really done that yet yeah that s because we haven t got the arch up yet oh you mean on the bottom of the bridge yeah that s a good idea well we need to start working on it all right well i ll leave you alone and i ll come back and check on you later okay guys we ve got four of these we need a lot more all right then well let s get going i m going to keep working on the arch okay wait wait wait that was part of the arch support the first arch needs to get worked on could you guys make the second road and i ll continue on the arch it needs to get to get built this idea isn t working maybe we should try to like add this on here so that it doesn t like fall oh okay and that way the arch will stick to the top and this arch will stick to the bottom do you girls want to try that sure sure also i think it will hold maybe a little better because nicky it s not all like this is just like that it s still gonna kind of it s still going to kind of stick to this even if we had this idea it d be like that it won t exactly hold that very well show me how it s going to be touching like this onto there i think yeah well like like that this way yeah but like with this on top so like that and then this at the bottom okay it will hold better now actually this is the right way here right yes it s like that okay yes and then we also figured out um when there s going to be 1000 grams on there it broke in half oh no this part it kinda snapped it can hold 500 yeah it can hold 500 it can hold 500 grams yes and 200 and 200 grams yes so i don t oh you tried 700 grams also yes okay so that s not bad it kinda snapped here but yeah so um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the like underneath okay the piers we should add the piers in the middle seriously well yeah we can add it like side middle and side i feel like we should do it like bang one on that side and one on the other yeah but it s still with the one on top yeah yeah we definitely want it want it to hold yeah definitely yes all right i want to see what s going on over here right now working on the railing okay and molly s doing that by she gluing she s working on the sidewalk right now we re almost done with the railing okay and what molly s doing right now is she is we re gluing two popsicle sticks together like this okay and uh we re going to glue them against here okay so they can we re probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle so they glue together easily glue them right here to the side okay and then we re going to put the railing on the side of this so like on this side like this and then the railing will be on this side so that ll the railing is three inches brooke said right so we re almost done with our bridge stuff at this would it be helpful to work from the bottom to glue the pedestrian bridge would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom yeah probably would and even though it bends it s bent it s really really strong uh huh it can hold more than a kilogram oh that s wonderful now did you um what kind of force what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle um it s compression and tension tension is pushing it out like this making the sides curl up and then the compression is what makes the bridge okay so you re going to compensate for that like this so are these your trusses no these are the railings we thought that it would act like a truss okay even though we re not going to have one going on the bottom they re going to be on the top it s all going to be on top and you did try laying it across a 20 inch gap we measured it to make sure it s 20 inches okay good well do want to try measuring a 20 inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it not while it s wet but when it s dry see what it s like what are you doing molly i m gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk and then when it s dry i m going to get them to go together like that okay and then i m going to take my railing how s that going to attach with another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk and then just attach the whole thing to the bridge as one piece okay i was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top connecting the two railings together with popsicle sticks at the top like a covered bridge yeah so this is for a crab run bridge is that what it s called yes that s a real bridge that needs to be replaced isn t it yes and we ve actually figured out what s it s going to be replaced by oh okay you found it on the internet it s actually it s um a beam bridge but it s not over water it s over rough terrain okay and it s in highland county it s way to the it s northwest,1.0
can you think of what what images are coming into your head about the holocaust that relate to this um people dying in the gas chambers okay and and how did that happen he convinced other people that they were awful and then that s really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that okay so you re saying hitler couldn t have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the jewish people were what nothing they were just less than just a lesser race of people you re on a good track i ll check back with you in a second by stepping on another group of people so the other groups would actually help them like we have to remember that the injustice the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it s not just injustice anyway you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing well outside people like in atlanta and birmingham like in there like in birmingham were being persecuted while people in atlanta weren t really doing anything well i mean look what s happening today i mean we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what martin luther king did for alabama so you re saying you see a connection in the real world news that sort of our soldiers the fact that they volunteer would be an example for number five is that what you are saying yeah had y all talked about number five yet uh we were just going in order and seeing which ones that we could and yours is read me your quotation um injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere okay good well you re just being to come up with things okay go ahead i m just going to okay so what s the first question explain the context in which um martin luther king said this and how it applies in that situation okay he doesn t want people to sit back and not do anything about a problem he wants them to go and help and stop it s almost as if their problem is his problem is his problem good i like that but even though he wants them to help well he doesn t want them to do it in a violent way always need to underguard mlk with that don t we and that sort of ties into it s wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends do you find yourself as you re discussing any one of these the others layer on there yeah that s why it feels so important to have gotten this whole document as a whole think you ve gotten enough from them brianna for that one yeah i think so well i guess clyde s already said that there s already one for the current news yeah that we could put down so the volunteer soldiers volunteer army volunteer army i ll check back with y all good job are they more reluctant to like um listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it yeah i think that s it okay so in watership down the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior how do you spell that because i think i spelled that before privileges privileges you know what to be honest with you every time i am typing i let spell check do it because that d and g always messes me up i was spelling superiority superiority i m sorry okay so what group have you chosen colleen and what what uh privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals and i hear that you re using a watership down example which my idea your idea good for you and what is the um what warren are we talking about the very first one um sandleform sandleform yeah yeah go ahead and tell me about that yeah it s like um the higher class rabbits didn t want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies does that make sense to you india that s a good example i really like it okay have you gotten anything else um we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies what was the time in history bish um number two where this quotation applies is the holocaust um during nazi rule people felt better about discriminating against the jews because many others were also doing it so what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges um actually i think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights right so the whole group of what the whole group of um nazis the nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored hitler and the nazis but maybe they wouldn t have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality is that kind of where we are with this yes good well y all go ahead i m just going to watch a minute so i ll finish writing the watership down one the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to how about admit that some of the lower number four would be easier to connect to a teenager s life that one actually fits for both of those what does um for telling a time in a teenager s life um both of these the two parts of the quote would apply because it s like when you re getting like verbally abused it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual so if there s a whole group picking on you then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily so say say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who s sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there so they ask hey you don t have to sit over at our table but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day they ll probably say no because they won t think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left and they don t want to go by the garbage cans nobody wants to i think that s a good connection a good very present day connection good i ll be back yes of course um allison would you like to i have no clue would it be okay to write about like how people in foreign countries use like the sex trade as an it an i it relationship certainly mr gallant s class we just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down that s okay that s okay that seems very real to me okay fictional things so if it s fictional it doesn t have to be people i didn t say that we could use um what s that watership down i said we could use that did i not all right let s see okay whatever i said we can use hazel and the warren for oppressed people that are not but i think we should do efrafa because the bunnies like revolted and they got free remember yeah that s what i m thinking i m hearing an argument where both of you think watership would be a good connection but we re debating which what oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever which warren would like be better i think efrafa which one did you say um the first one that came to from what was it called sandleford sandleford okay tell me why you think that because they were they had freedom but it was like they were just they couldn t do what they wanted all the time they could just do certain things in a certain vicinity they couldn t go out or go anywhere and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they um like revolted against their warren and left what were you going to add michael oh like it was like a routine everyday like it was the same thing they followed like a routine like they went out and then ate and then slept but i think efrafa is like that except for it s a lot worse like they didn t even get to go out like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed like right here and they d have to go right back into their warren i think they re both good examples but i think machi s is more able to be explained by that because they did but in his you know uh uh hazel and big wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for they eventually got what they wanted in efrafa they didn t get what they wanted until someone came in to and not everybody in efrafa got out but not everyone in um sandleford got out most of them didn t but i mean the group that we re talking about the main but the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted where they wanted because no one else would listen let me tell you something the main reason we re doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing will inform our later life it doesn t make me sad that you have two examples because when it s a little bit wrong or when it s a lot wrong because when you notice it when it s a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong so it kind of pleases me that you re seeing it at two different levels so i think use efrafa and sandleford and you ll have the best answer okay okay what are we working on we are trying to debate whether we should pick cuba or egypt as current events for for privileged groups so we can get well let s hear your arguments cuba fidel castro has been a tyrant for metaphorically he s about to die he s still in power okay egypt s been resolved already no well they re arguing that it s not in the news but it s going on right now well i think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we ve like talked about in class that s really really really and we all understand it what don t you understand about cuba though like there s nothing that s really in the news right now cuba they still have the same old thing just like every other country that s happened just a little bit worse here s what i m hearing you have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the egypt example and it doesn t dis uh disvalue yours because it s important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he s talking about apathy when it s happened for a long time people don t less and less and less revolt okay could we possibly do cuba in the history one oh i think you could work on that that s a great idea how are we coming good we re done good done i think we are finished i want to hear your uh everyday life one all right our for our teenager yes all right we re saying like if there s a group of popular kids and they re like calling names and putting down a group of the not so popular kids and they re just not treating them like they re normal people too they re just treating them like lesser people less than human they might they might not pay attention to them also they just in the way you wouldn t necessarily recognize a theme but in a way you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being okay great so i want you as you re looking back over yours make sure that you ve given your reader or your listener enough information my shortest one was like three sentences and there s nothing magic about the number of sentences just check yours because you re a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there s any details you could add okay great how are we coming um good pretty much done awesome awesome you ve got three of the four which ones did you do um the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life and your quotation was oh we did um it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons thank y all for choosing that one that s a very hard one and we put and the third one great now will some body tell me what your fictional one was um we did why don t you explain this one isabelle okay i did peter pan uh huh cause when peter pan he persuades or he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them but he s doing it for the wrong reasons what reasons do you think he s really doing it to have a mother for the children the lost children and so he s not really thinking of their well being he s thinking of his and the lost boys well being right what a great connection i m so proud of y all that s awesome and did you do news uh we did history history what s your historical one uh we did uh when the europeans,1.0
today is wednesday yes i would clone myself good why why would you clone yourself because everybody deserves a second me so you would just and i would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on honestly what would some of the negatives to cloning something like that well it s another me but it s still good because you know i m me and i m good and bad do you know your clone is not going to be like set right you re gonna have to wait for it to grow up so i have to raise a little baby clone of me yes and it ll look just like me when i was a baby pretty much oh that s wrong oh my god there are so many possibilities alright so let s start off with i ll get it a baby raise your hand if you can remind us like what is cloning there s only one of you like taking the dna or like i don t know like whatever out of one person like trying to like duplicate it into another one okay great we re all well was there only like one type of cloning what were some of the different types well one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only and another one is let s see animal and livestock cloning anything else you want to add to that gady so what s one way they do the cloning so they take the dna from one animal what do they do do you remember what parts they used like what kind of cell they used nucleus they did take the nucleus and they used the eggs of the other animal okay it s kind of interesting you can take the egg from one animal and completely change its dna so now when that turns into a new organism it s an identical copy of the animal that it came from and if you take you can bring back endangered species too because remember that or whatever then they put in the cow yeah but they were like related in some kind of way so it wasn t like weird that s true it was probably a decendent do you guys remember that from the video they had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct in fact they couldn t actually do the tests on the animal remember they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn t even do the tests on them right how long did last does anyone remember three days yeah it was about three days right but it was the first time so when they couldn t open up that cow the cow died right i don t know that for sure but i m guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically they were oh no i was just wondering because there s a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb that s true that does happen i mean i don t care if the cow died honestly that s another hamburger for me but that goward that goward that s swole you can t get any other animal like that anybody else in here agree that it s okay to do that testing to save endangered species well yeah because if there s like a hundred million cows and one whatever that thing was called so we should probably try and get more of them yeah why not okay we should clone pandas let s hear somebody else though is there anybody else that has i said alligator try and bring it back that s true what happens when there s so many i mean how many of you have ever watched the movie jurassic park oh my god i ve seen all of them at least twice so that s a good question so if we can bring back something that looks like a cow fabulous what happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool but has bigger teeth well you see it breaks out of the cage like in jurassic park the lost world and it starts attacking all the great well yeah it kind of started eating people that was wrong fabulous but what could be some of the downfalls on that like any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct well hardly any of the you need to the dna might get messed up yeah but remember that when we re messing around with the dna yeah maybe there could be a mistake what happens then it could die it could die yes i would say one good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to that s probably what scientists are thinking wouldn t that be great if i could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does because a lot of things they tell you about you know dinosaurs is what they think they do well we think they eat this and we think this is how they lived wouldn t it be great if we could actually study those what if dinosaurs were never real well they found skeleton remains so they re pretty much sure they were around they also found because you can t just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive because it will mess up the chain of life anthony has a really good point because what s going to happen if we have dinosaurs we can t just stick them somewhere for them to roam around because they don t have anything they can naturally eat anymore and they don t have any natural predators anymore that s why you just bring back t rexes and velociraptors and what not then you just feed them cows you don t know if they necessarily eat cows though you don t know that well it s meat it is meat but that s also your food source well that s not going to be maybe eight or nine maybe 25 for a t rex you re underestimating the size of some of these animals but the same thing applies to actual animals instead of just dinosaurs what happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses and we re expanding our cities so we re moving into some areas where there are some animals and they start to die off because we are taking over their land so yeah we could make a hundred copies of these animals or whether it s plants or birds or certain insects but that is a good question where are they going to live if we just bring them back wildlife park so that is a good thing and again remember that you all add because if you put them somewhere that a park they won t necessarily survive so you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that so yeah the food chain interesting how everything s connected raise your hand if you d like to share one of your questions from yesterday we ll start with anthony okay so like say me and this lady get married we both can t have kids so they take my dna and they make a clone of me i m married to this person would that be only my child or would that be our child and if why maybe yeah but what if you re married well does it require two people that has your dna i m sorry i didn t hear you maybe it is maybe it s totally the environment who s to say maybe if you raise it and you re like this is our kid well because of that case then there can t be any more like if we depended on cloning there woudn t be any well there d be less drama in the world because we wouldn t be doing stuff the natural way and like people being knocked up in bars and stuff and random places and stuff and like not knowing their father in life you know but you know what i m saying right do you think it would be hard like what if people were 100 dependent on this there would be a lot less problems eventually if you keep cloning yourself and then your clone cloned itself and your clone clones itself you d have the same group of people you d have the best group ever yeah but how would you know because you wouldn t be here that s dumb that s what that is that s interesting we can t have just a bunch of the same people that d be one stupid that d be dumb man i don t know walking around seeing all the same people that s stupid you re not going be like like the matrix everything repeating other questions let s get one from a female this time we got the guys questions let s get a girl don t all shout out all at once mayra what s one of your questions i said like if they clone a sheep and it s like sick wouldn t it or let s say there s a regular sheep and they clone that wouldn t the clone be sick too what did she say not necessarily no because it s like you said it s two entire different bodies of life a lot of things can go wrong in one person so how could it just be the same thing two different unless it s like a problem with an organ that the one had and then well i want to say that like a disesased kid maybe what about remember you just did genetics right if it s in your dna what would happen if it was in your dna it probably would get it if it was something that it caught it probably wouldn t get it that s true so it depends i guess maybe what it is right so you have this sheep just cloned it and because it has something very serious with it and if it s genetic then yeah there s probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on i think they were showing remember when they were doing dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned i think they were talking about the sheep dolly and then they had some mice that they had cloned they had said that the animals they had cloned does anyone remember what any of the side effects what they ve noticed sometimes they can t breathe right what else sometimes they died really young so just because it s a clone maybe we haven t quite figured it out yet because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal if they re dying younger or having problems growing other questions hector what is one of your questions or if you don t have your questions ready or you feel like your questions were answered maybe you just have a comment you have none what do you think about cloning do you agree with it or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it um i agree with it like the pros i would agree with it like for food for what like cloning for more food oh like the chickens right cloning to make more chickens wouldn t it be great if i have a perfect chicken and i could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken i ve had all types of chickens they all taste the same that s true everything tastes like chicken but have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick well like a tiny little drumstick they still taste good true but what one gives you more food you got a point there okay so maybe right but still you could put them together in the case of kfc the reason why their chicken s so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big yes that s the way they approach that that s the best way to do that right there not really people get cancer from that so would this be a good solution so instead of making eating our cows and feeding pigs and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones to make them larger and grow faster would it better to just take the large big cows and just clone them or make chicken and make copies of it yes no does anyone see any maybe this sounds really great like we re going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat but is there any downside to that no honestly no i don t think so not for you great is there anybody else money money how they could cost more to but they could cost less and be more affordable which is what we want good money is a good issue right people won t have to think about money issues i don t think there d be a money issue if you were cloning chickens because you can always just get you know take a syringe and like but that s what he was saying that maybe it d be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff yeah mm hmm it would take longer what do you guys think about the cloning for body parts can i go back to the chickens for a second sure go for it wouldn t there be a lot less farmers so then there d be a lot less jobs because you know like the whole that is true like a lot of companies will go out of business because i don t know i feel like there s like a monopoly on it more private industries are going to go out of business and that s going to destroy livelihoods because all the big livestock companies like kfc and mcdonald s well they re not a livestock company they re fast food but they re going to be selling it to those right they re going to let it go off of just by show of hands who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with that s just because you guys are okay with dying chris not sure or does it just kind of i don t care really what was the question oh i said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food no before that the one before anthony started talking we were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens we ll get there i know the question we ll get there i want to say something we ll get there alright erica medical the cloning the body parts like if people are sick and they need a new heart or new lungs or a new kidney ms scott i wrote the name of it it s called therapeutic cloning they refer to it that way so that s what it s called when you do that so when we re using it for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues whether it s like just a few cells or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries what do you think about that i think it s a good idea it s a good idea do you have any reasons to be worried about that it would be better than nothing any concerns anybody else have you heard of of a book called what was it called i don t think i have what s it about that s okay levon is going to have to read it now because he ll be like what it s about like in the future will people if parents don t want their kids any more they can like they can give them a like they can take their other body parts off and they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff so they like your body parts are still alive so one arm could be like your real arm and your other arm could be like interesting i ll have to read that book sometime now when they re doing the therapeutic cloning they re not actually creating like a whole new human and then the body parts up there s a couple of different ways they were doing it do you remember what they were using to how they were growing the organs that is true but what were they trying to do with the cloning how are they trying to avoid that do you remember does anybody remember how is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting because do you guys remember what happened to the woman close very close to that so remember when you get a body organ like the lady with the kidney right who d she get the kidney from her aunt yeah so she got it from her aunt somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family like they were a match she had to take remember all of those pills she had to take to make sure her body doesn t like get rid of the kidney and then unfortunately it still did so they re looking at getting making kidneys and i think that they were growing them inside of a cow i think it was a cow might have been a pig it was a big animal so you re going to grow human kidneys that are functional mm hmm on a cow they were using another animal and they were actually growing it like not in the animal it wasn t part of the animal they were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning so on the outside of a cow there d be kidneys underneath the skin yep and then they would take take them out and transplant them into humans this is like that episode of south park where it s a little bit inappropriate but not too much then let s not go there it s a little too inappropriate then let s not nevermind nevermind you re going to watch it for yourself fabulous but they are also trying by cloning because remember a lot of times they re trying to find animal parts that might match like for example did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart so you could have a pig heart they were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts the problem is of course is it s a pig s heart which means the outside of the heart looks like pig cells so your body would know that it s not a human heart it would know that it s a pig heart and your body probably won t want that in its body so they were trying remember they had trying to grow new pigs i think they had little piglets running around the pigs had human dna in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside so that when they keep those body parts if they put them in a human your body wouldn t recognize it as being something different did you know they ve actually done that my dad s friend s daughter has pig intestines,1.0
what are you noticing about it compared to these two this one s light brown these are all dark so i think this one s not getting enough water so we should water it what s happening because it s not getting enough water it s like drying out what s happening to the seed the seed is dying it can t grow and the seed s gonna die yeah because what s the first stage of a life cycle and you have water in it it s a seed yeah and then it sprouts but on this one all stems are dying oh wow that looks really dry so which one are you measuring we re measuring water okay let s measure it let me measure it okay let s measure it and let s record how tall it is i don t know how you use it yeah almost four inches centimeters here i ll measure it seven and a half centimeters can you hold it yeah maybe if you hold it oh no it came out it s okay it s alright we ll just ours came out and then it s still good just hold him up it s six centimeters okay let s check wow it s growing two times enough keep it there and let s see let s see if the rest of your group agrees yeah i agree that leaf is up to six centimeters okay so what in in a week how much has it grown it s grown three three centimeters three centimeters yeah three centimeters okay write and record it so that s parsley write write why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato because the tomato is like a tomato has one thing and parsley has the same thing and they come out what do you mean the same i think maybe because parsley because parsley has a rose it s easier because because a tomato has more time to grow because it like it s the kind of vegetable that has which is actually even drier can you guys help her out can you help her out i think well i think that s growing better than the roma tomatoes is tomato a fruit day one like it s growing a fruit that s what the tomato is like a vegetable it s the fruit of the plant yeah that we eat but i think that what i think it s important is that we grow this yes yes they ll grow at different times once they grow it ll grow fast yeah we started this one planting faster right we started this one two weeks later do you think we need to water the tomato more though yeah when you look at the parsley and feel feel how wet that one is and it s doing so well i know compared to the tomato maybe we need to water more yes is this parse it s the parts no it s the gender i think they need to get more sun and water okay so abby s measuring her tomato i did it what do you guys want to do do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem top of the leaf top of the leaf the leaf is part of the plant okay so you re putting it down all the way down down and round it s four okay it s four alright four so every single time when you measure this plant are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem is that what you re going to do yeah it started four sessions ago it started four sessions ago this one started two weeks before this one let s look at the measurements and how much for growing can you compare these two what are some things that you notice i notice that it s grown three and a quarter centimeters everything else won t be able to have two more centimeters g plant can you tell me which one s growing quicker this one are pregnant are you sure about that yes actually maybe because this started out and this one not so here before okay and we started this one when we started this on i mean two weeks ago two weeks after this one yeah so even though this one was started later what s happened it s growing more faster taller yup okay why do you think and you guys even noticed that it was dry and it s still growing faster yeah so should we keep water should we water it more and see what happens yeah what do you want to do i want to want to since there s no more seeds in there because we took two of them out and then the other one died i think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens okay go ahead you can plant it and there are sometimes seeds they just won t germinate they re sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won t they won t grow maybe that s what happened to this one too can i go through and bob it but in the inside of it it looks very dark but the outside of it does so maybe it s not as dry as we thought yeah now we have to take measurements again we ll just see if that helps there s only this one left let s look at this seed what do you notice about it i know for we came from last time when we grow the parsley this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed these are not dead how about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed it s really small and things can use the lines smaller maybe because they re smaller things or like a sunflower oh so you think maybe the seed the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be yeah okay on that some of the tomatoes are as big as that or bigger than that sometimes the seeds are how they start out are smaller but sometimes the shape of it sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes but others not you mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant sometimes yeah it could what about a flower or something flowers seeds are different they all look different no so is that always the case no but some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger and so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster or slower compared to these two plants than yours and maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference alright you guys can get online yeah you can go ahead and water it one in here and one in here and then i want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you e done you might want to water it a lot more let me try and then over it we finished watering our plants do we each get a computer we need help when we type into trying capitals in it it deleted our numbers so okay we didn t know what was wrong well you have your title plant type let s be more specific because you re not doing all the plants what plant are you graphing right now swiss chard and kale did you measure them already yeah and then we drag the numbers but then they don t i think it s because of all that room james where is your measurement for swiss chard for today right here you want to record that swiss chard and kale was what was kale again seven this height look correct no what are we missing do you guys notice the up need oh i notice there you go alright okay so what s going to be your label for your bar graph that s the one going along the bottom the bottom the plant height how high the plant reading are you gonna what are you gonna graph then for your bars hmm what do we always look at when we re thinking about our graphs we always go back to our data table right what are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not seven centimeters for kale you re gonna have to put kale right there i know it s just that was the big plan i think i m on the tail now because okay you have what s this one that was eggplant okay and this is swiss chard yeah well here s that why don t you measure that you haven t measured it yet about five centimeters did you agree walt yeah about five centimeters is that what you got too yeah so why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard and just kale or are we gonna have a graph for both together what would be easier both together i think should we put it together how would we do that how would you merge that i think like both should have their own bar like in the same graph i think so too so which plant do you want to graph today are you gonna do swiss chard or kale they really needed help let s do kale let s look at kale okay what s kale here s the kale which one are we measuring james what did you get for the height for kale seven centimeters okay look see if andrew gets seven yeah about seven okay and what was the height of it last week james so andrew knows it was six centimeters okay it was six centimeters so just put six centimeters here there you go okay so lets fix this let s just make it kale height or grow and then what s this what are you gonna put at the bottom look at your table the height of kale is that gonna go along the bottom how tall it was like in day one and day two let s look what were the labels for our table date and measurement okay so that s what we re going with so the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side do you guys agree james you think that s right okay we ll try it go date and then go ahead and type measurement should we have a unit on it since we re talking about measurement mhmm okay so the whole point of and what s in row one one four 13 okay write that you re gonna put the date there will would you like a turn mhm instead of doing commas if you re gonna write it like that you re gonna put a dash in between i m gonna have will will type this time we ll take turns so type in the date okay and then what would go here under the what are you gonna graph like what s gonna be the bar graph part six centimeters no no the height was the another beam so type that in,1.0
it s probably three because five to the third is 125 alright so let s test that out can i use my calculator you can have your guy test it out here oh the other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this this is something that is unusual because it s got that subscript read that first line up at the top where it says pronouncing logarithmic equations log base b of x equals y yeah so can you transfer that pronunciation to for example the one in example six how would you say that out loud log base two of eight equals it s three equals three so that s how we say these things out loud log base two of eight the little number this subscript is the base keep going you guys are doing fantastic speak up the log of 10 000 is four forgot i don t have a pencil you re off no pencil in number nine is it one for number nine yeah when the log when the base is equal to x when b is equal to x it will be one so would 10 be negative one uh 10 yeah negative one oh i think i get it now and then 11 would be negative three negative three yeah it s like the power stable thing you know yeah it s like four to the y would be equal to this yeah so 12 and 13 would be zero let s see yeah yep okay pretty easy yeah and what s 14 14 is one half so again what you re saying is if it s a fraction or if like like for 14 yeah it d be a fraction so 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half yeah so that what about that one made you think it s going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers the other ones were integers because in the log the little exponent there mmhm is less than the actual number okay let s work on the pronunciation because this is something that s brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud let s go back up to the top where it says read this out loud so matt i ll have you are you the what is your role here we re professors here oh so that s a good role for you so why don t you speak that out loud log base root of x equals y yeah now i want you to say the first example out loud log base of log base five of 25 equals 2 yeah so it s hard to pronounce it yeah but the little number that s down is what uh base yeah so it s the base so when we say it we re gonna say base little number whatever it is alright so now say what you were saying before either of you guys you told me why it comes out a fraction how will you recognize it comes out a negative number when the y or when the x is a fraction and the log base is a whole number okay yeah so like which examples do that ten and eleven alright that s good how will you recognize if it comes out as zero see any patterns for the ones that log if the x is a 1 alright yeah why does that make sense have you figured it out like any number to the power of 1 is itself or no it s zero or i mean not any number to the power of zero is one exactly alright you re very you re getting right to the idea of what a log is how will you recognize the ones that will come out one without calculating x equals the base okay well said why does that make sense in terms of exponents cause if you divide itself it ll equal one can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one because that s the next thing we re going to try to do seven to the fifth power seven to the one equals seven good having done all of this can you say what a log is in one word a single word it s like the power of mmhm it s the exponent yeah good a log is an exponent now what i d like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is yeah woah oh oh oh oh it would be don t stop so it s gotta be two take the so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number so right to the there yeah so 32 something with something to the fourth yeah maybe five five to the fourth five to the execuse you so 59 is one 52 equals one so it d be 59 yeah 18 would be just three is it a thousand yeah a thousand you put ten thousand i have a question yeah for this one what s the for this one what s the log no well yeah i don t know the log of what i think i understand your question but you first have to figure out the way to read these things read that part that first because the pronunciation is challenging at first log base b of x equals y alright so now read example well we know example four is three so the log is three so read example four out loud so log three of 27 equals three good except i want you to say the word base in there okay log base three of 27 equals three perfect so i think your question was about examples seven and eight so what s the base wouldn t the base be one it s just not there it s not there here s the question the answers the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation what s equivalent to that oh if it s not there the base is ten alright so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven ten squared equals 100 ten squared equals 100 does it still work for that is that void mmhm because it would be ten to the fourth equals but i thought he just said the base was one well he said the base was one he thought it might be oh it s not it turns out it s ten okay so the base if not written is ten i want you to check this two ways who s our calculator person here alright so brandon i want you just to type in the log but just use this button it s next to the seven just type in log of 100 so if he doesn t use any base it comes out as two now try it with the log base on the new operating system log base ten of 100 log base ten of 100 mmhm see if that still works two it turns out it s sort of optional if there s no base what is the base nothing no it s a certain thing so if there s no base written like all of the other ones had a base written okay if there s no base written it s saying what s the number to raise a certain base to to get 100 and this one came out two so what s the number that you can use as a base squared to get 100 ten yeah so if there s no base the base applied is ten and it turns out you can write it or not so what i d like you guys to do is as you re working through these also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you re taught so just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again yeah sure and the one s at the bottom you can t just type into the calculator so you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there then for like any number in there that s a really good insight how come that s the case because anything to the zero power is one you got it yeah except for one number there s one number you can t put there zero yeah good job you got it good job thank you 20 would be 81 i wasn t even close so ten alright so ten to the third would be 1000 for 18 wouldn t it be a thousand supposed to be base is implied to be ten ten to the third would be 1000 i m not sure for 18 i don t know alright alright say it again except this time include the word base log base of log base of eight wait log base of eight equals zero close log base eight log base eight of one equals zero that s it exactly yeah okay so we say base where s the base always on a log equation under the exponent yeah its a subscript it s down a subscript so i d like you to pronounce number 12 log three of one equals zero close i want you to get the word base in there log base three of one equals zero yeah and that way if you re always saying what the base is when you create an equivalent exponential function it s going to be a lot easier so next to each one of these let s do a few together let s do the top row going one six 11 i want you to write an exponential equation using 5 25 and 2 so it would just be five squared equals 25 exactly what s the base in that equation it s five yeah so you did two cubed equals eight yeah yeah so now you recognize you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent yeah that s good each of these numbers is an exponent what d you notice about the ones that came up zero would you be able to recognize those and predict any number works for it really what do you mean any number works for it for this one oh i see for that last one you could put any number here other than zero yes i thought it was one but they had got it one works but so does two so does two three four and five i m wondering about the ones like 12 and 13 how would you predict or recognize in the future that the log is going to be zero if it has a one for the x for the x yeah mmhm yep i think there s a fancy mathy word called a characteristic for that but we don t use that word very often but yeah you could say the x cause that s how it showed up in our first equation sure how will you recognize that it s going to come out a negative number if it has a fraction in it mmhm as the x okay well said yeah why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents on the green chart whatever is on the left side and whatever s left yeah our powers table you re talking about all of our fractions here yeah how about the ones that came out with one as the log the log was one they have the same base and the same x value and what about this one this is a fraction so yeah how come it had a negative log well i know it s because it s a fraction can you write an equivalent exponential equation two to the no two to the negative one mmhm equals it doesn t equal this right actually it does two to the negative one equals half okay yep okay so that s correct,1.0
and why face changes are different at different pressures and so i think that at a certain pressure they re so close together that they aren t a gas anymore and they become a liquid cool because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out and the liquids can still move freely but they re more close together so okay we thought that in a liquid they can t move as freely as it can in gas yeah yeah well another gas has to expand well it does expand to fill its container yeah so does that have anything to do with how they move well you said that some tried to sometimes they don t always expand as much as they can but i think they do my guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is cause you think of pressed gas what are you guys all thinking about of what you re hearing well do things sound reasonable yeah is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas at what point does that matter or not matter uh huh okay we re gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into that s what i want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what you know maybe the book would say beyond just a definition right if you re going down the right path here and you know what that is i see you re making a nice venn diagram here comparing and contrasting that s great what i want you to do is on this sheet here cause this is what you re going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes put down these thoughts these words that you ve got you can even draw your venn diagram on here but explain what that means what does that mean bubbles floating inside the lagoon what does that mean it s escaping off the top when we think of matter what do we actually think of in our heads conceptually we re thinking of a chunk of matter a beaker of liquid so there s some space and what else and what so matter has mass and volume what s matter made up of okay atoms molecules if it helps you you can decide okay let s think of this in terms of water just so it s a known right okay good yeah that s a good way to do that so draw some pictures when you say it s escaping off the top what does that look like okay so try to get it into some visuals okay i ll come back matter like i don t really understand the definition of heat yeah okay so what is heat it s what heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing right so you want to separate what something is from how it behaves so you re saying heat is the transfer of energy transfer is how it behaves right what is it it s just energy it s energy right so heat is a form of energy and you re absolutely right it can move around in the environment between systems in and out of the system so let s say you ve got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it s hot right it s sitting in a cold room what do you expect to happen what will happen to the temperature of the water for example it will okay so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out yeah okay equilibrium good so you understand that heat is energy and you understand that it can move around so the question here is how does adding heat energy for example matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state so not that it does but how so what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter what is matter something with a mass or volume occupies space has mass or volume you know you just said it okay yeah see you know okay matter has volume it takes up space right and it also has what mass the property of mass do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter like if you think of it obviously this is matter right but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things yes okay atoms molecules what would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it remember this isn t rights or wrongs this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this so what if i have two atoms and i add more energy to them what if i have hundreds of atoms and i make them all move faster well i mean that s what i m asking you guys to think about as best you can how would that occur we said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to and they get warmer oh that s the same thing as adding more energy right then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid i would say add some pictures i think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter what it s made of so why don t you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in say something that is changing state maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see as being a series of steps getting it from here to here so start with a lump of solid matter okay something like that take it all the way to a gas okay how do you see that matter okay okay alright let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that start with an atom and build like a box so folks i want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other theorizing is good why don t you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here yep did i take your pencil i m sorry okay we have a pencil thief so you re saying there s some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time water would be evaporating ice would be melting and vapor would be condensing so i just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory how would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under yesterday we talked about some things that affect phase what were they what was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in okay temperature anything else pressure pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature and the matter itself how that would work okay you may need to mentally zoom in on matter what is it what is ice what is water what is gas if you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk what do we see on the inside what s it made up of at a very small level does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules like you can visualize that so bring that in here if you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that try okay okay how s that sound okay a couple more minutes seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this and you re working on presenting it okay how am i supposed to do this oh god i can t draw cups remember you have to explain to everyone what you re drawing s showing so it doesn t have to be perfect oh okay don t worry about perfection you re gonna get to stand up there and say this is what i drew and they just have to believe you okay that s how bad it s gonna be okay so there s like the water i think i have the difference between the molecules okay so that shows that that s gas and liquid what is the big red arrow it s like going up out of the liquid what s it the molecules okay molecules yeah that s what this is supposed to be so the only thing i would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why like why or how what are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you re drawing to happen that s up to you what you think is making i think that s quite good actually that explains it to me really well the things that you think are having an effect on what s actually going to or not going to happen like this amazing flame like that amazing flame so you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that label it f l a m e you ve vibrated those are actually quite good vibrations that s our gas they re awfully close together these are closer together here than they are here is that something that you intended no there supposed to be really spread out it s up to you what you re going to write i m simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together we didn t mean to do that i can draw more what do you think so we ve shown them closer together do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn t matter so they could be closer together they could be closer together as long as they re moving more okay so i think being like spreading out and occupying all space available so if you re thinking that you should include that somehow and it seems like then you and katelyn and ignesia s have different ideas about this and that s important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about what are you doing oh you re adding to it so i hear lindsey s saying that you thought they d be more spread out occupying more space and i hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn t really matter so that s worth thinking about because that s two different ways of looking at this that s two different ways of looking at this anyway we don t need perfection right now we need your initial thoughts but somewhere i d record that discrepancy i would record here that you re still thinking about that issue you think one thing you guys think another that s important so you guys i think i d like to have groups don t worry if you re not totally done i would just like groups to kind of explain what they ve got so far and we re going to go in numerical order so i am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though and give your poster to one group member let s do that now don t worry if it s incomplete this is a work in progress come on back to the tables don t worry if it s not finished you get to explain it and we re gonna keep these around so you can add to them come on back to the tables i count two alright so group one i m gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster you guys let s load towards the front of the room so that we re all closer you don t need all your stuff just come on up and sit a little closer let s squeeze in in all these front tables yeah you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you re thinking was so everybody come on up as close as you can let s squeeze in at these tables let s get a couple people here let s get a couple people here pull a chair on up come on up somebody come sit here somebody sit here so we ve only got a little bit of time left and i want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts you guys may on your pre think sheets take some notes remember this isn t about right or wrong this is about how do we think we understand this system right now and this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit so their question the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state so you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here okay so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point and we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question we were thinking about specific heat the equation for specific heat also we said based on the specific heat of the substance an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount and we thought that was important and it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat so if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree and then a different substance by a different amount and we also thought about how solid liquid and gas that it has to do with the change of space and the solid they re like locked in place but they re still vibrating a little bit then if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid where there s more freedom of movement but they re still sort of contained and then in a gas and in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster and they re not like moving in a certain direction what questions do you guys have for them or comments about what they re thinking why would different materials have different specific heats you don t have to know the answer does anyone have thoughts on that guesses maybe they re different what different types of material i mean substance so i think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different so they can kind of collect heat differently how does that sound to folks reasonable is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances okay so maybe that s something worth looking into as we study this and see why that why that physical property of specific heat why isn t it the same for everything and so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here because you can see that we drew all the molecules really close together compared to the solid and liquid i guess and we weren t sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely and it doesn t matter how spaced out they are as long as they can they re not stuck in one space like solids are they can just move wherever or whether they have to be more spaced out and so didn t occupy the whole space do you guys have thoughts about that what they re saying do you guys understand the point katelyn s making how far do they have to be to be a gas well i think that that s actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure,1.0
right here okay so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is yeah yes because your asymptote is where this would be undefined right so it s gonna be x equals what positive two positive but okay if we put positive two there we have two plus two so it d be negative two negative two that s why we have an asymptote that x equals negative two okay now is there another number out here no no so what would that other number be see there is one here but there s not one here so it d just be zero so it d just be zero so does that tell you what your other asymptote is y equals zero cause f of x stands for that s your y isn t it okay so you can tell by looking at the function itself what your asymptotes are gonna be okay tell me what this asymptote s gonna be your x your vertical asymptote zero zero x equals zero so you re gonna be drawing your asymptote right there what about your y remember how we covered this up and you would have y equals what negative one negative one y plus negative one so the function itself tells you your asymptotes doesn t it okay does that help yeah okay all right so no but it s like that right here though but see she has negative two right here then how did she get the did we write the first one wrong then cause x equals zero no because she got zero and negative two and that s what i got you wrote it down wrong where right here cause zero is supposed to be on top oh so no never mind you got it right it s the same i just switched these around no but you re right because you know how x is vertical okay so for this one it s going to be the x is going to be negative 2 right mm hmm okay i got it so wait the asymptote isn t the same thing as the parent function right no did you have the graph did it turn out and how do you know up here check this thing out huh so what would the parent function be that s what i was trying to work out for you did you find the parent function for what it s not x squared is it one over x all of them is going to be one over x cause you can t just put x she said put a one divided by x that d be the parent function all right how do you know which is the parent function it s the one that s consistent that first one that you put it s the one that s exactly in between the first and third quadrant this is your parent function this is your parent function this one and this one right so blue right there and right there but you totally ruined it yeah yeah the colors i used are kind of weird do you have a red are you using it this is the graph right so if it s the first one and the third one right hey wait that first thingy comes out at negative three not negative two hm this first little line right here comes out negative three not negative two is the parent function still i mean is the asymptote still negative two i think so how is one negative two you gotta switch it because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative so the y would be zero because it s not going to negative how would the y be zero the y is a negative you got em switched all you gotta do is switch em i m not understanding she busy okay oh i know why it s because we don t have no y in the equation like this one it d have a y the y would be negative one and on this one we don t have it so automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two that makes more sense all right you got it yeah i had to think about that so that s how you do it so then the asymptote is the right here uh huh which one so then the translation is the down one wait what the translation is the down one so what is this down let me plug it in divide by x parentheses one over divided by x minus one okay so we don t need no parenthesis no i m almost done you re crossing it that s the y yeah but that s the x this is x and this is y yes well look on the sheet it will show you that um i basically used this one as an example it s like the same type of format that the problem is okay okay yeah that makes sense so the asymptote is zero it says h equals x yeah yeah so zero yeah wait yeah this is the graph you start with yeah that makes more sense cause that s how the graph is okay we got the asymptote x equals is it zero yeah and then y equals negative one and the translation is one unit down do you have a value yeah uh oh so it d be three units down we would put this on negative three cause that s y so since it s y we would have to put it on negative three and zero right cause it s the same as this yeah and then y equals negative three yeah x equals zero and y equals negative three translation three units down wherever the lines like go the furthest but don t touch okay oh you re just marking down the asymptotes yeah she said she forgot yeah so i guess you can just put up there yellow okay are you on number four yes so on number four it would be five units to the left number four yeah yeah you re good okay she just told me she just told i just wrote it wrong i guess then how do you know how to graph it with like in the calculator in here and it s really not good to graph it here yeah okay this seems to be not that hard now that i get it really like remember how grayson thought that it was three i knew she was wrong i mean i didn t think it was wrong you just instinctively knew that it was wrong is it going to have a vertical shift also yep up down down okay up or down down how many two on number five oh three it would be three three okay so you re going to have two shifts on number five right okay uh huh i haven t plugged it in yet we re going to have a shift here right what would make that undefined if x equals how about positive two because two minus two is zero i mean the zero is where you needed to be so x equals two right okay now what are we going to do with this thing out here that s a vertical shift of y equals negative three y equals negative three so we have two translations okay two units right and,1.0
what are some other indicators that tell us i m in my target heart rate range yes by the categories on your rpe chart okay your rpe chart you could use that that s exactly right how about within your body what s something that your body can tell you that you re in that target heart rate range yes young lady um the way you breath and how you re feeling okay good your breathing your feeling some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin to hurt and your thighs are startin to be sore all those things are physical ways that your body s sayin hey i m doin a good job in this workout i m within my target heart rate range when we do this today i want you to kind of take a mental picture let take a mental picture of this is how my body feels when i m in my target heart rate range whether your lower end or higher end take a mental picture so that when you re out walking or not walking but when you re out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that you can kind of have an idea how you re feelin with those with those things and you can know whether you re close to being in your target heart rate range now one of the last things is is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history from heart disease to high blood pressure those types of things the cardio workout that we re doin today what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you who knows that what are some of those areas okay let s get you there amy it ll help prevent heart disease high blood pressure and diabetes okay the heart disease that s exactly right good cardio high blood pressure it s gonna bring the blood pressure down also diabetes along with high blood pressure you got high cholesterol all of those areas cardio is going to positively impact those areas okay the yes what do i need to lose weight okay to lose weight that s a question i get a lot of time if you want to lose weight ideally you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range or about 80 however you do actually at about you do burn more cal fat calories at about 60 but you re gonna burn more calories at 80 because it s a more intense workout okay so really ideally you d want to be within your target heart rate range typically up towards the higher end will be a little better because if you re gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end okay any other questions on anything all right we re gonna get started here you ve already got your target heart rates there i want you to look here and i want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is what is your zone and we ll notice this most of you you know we ve all figured it out you ll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand or where most of you are gonna be in the chart we start all the way down at 100 go all the way up to above 176 you ll start to see that that most likely that 151 to 175 that s gonna be our biggest area here that we re gonna fall into you can see right there we re at 75 so most of you in here where s our target heart rate range in between between 151 and 175 there you go between 151 and 175 that is right on the money for young adults your age if you re at that 176 or higher that s not a problem but that is an area where you know anything over about 185 or so then it just means that you ve got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people so most people though again are gonna be in that 151 to 175 that s a good job okay go ahead and go to your machines here lay your clip boards off to the side if you want to listen to your ipod or to your music you can only one ear phone though only one ear piece make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there we ll do something with those a little bit later and where we re gonna start with here is we re gonna start together we re gonna start with a two minute workout on this workout two minute warm up all we re gonna do is get warmed up you need to be out on the bike somewhere around 40 rpms ellipticals about the same thing 35 to 40 rpms on the treadmills around three speed will be a good good place to start with is everybody good we ready to go yes are we good back there you all set okay all right here we go startin on two minutes and start all right so make sure that we got those magnets on there bump that up to about three or so just to get warmed up this is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit now at the end of this warm up we re gonna check where your heart rate is we re gonna check that and you ll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to compared to you know what it was for a resting heart rate you most likely will not be though in your target heart rate zone right here after this warm up about halfway through good job anytime you work folks you should always do a warm up now we ve already stretched and done some a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here so you ve got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up don t jump right in to it you re gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk for you good job everybody doin good yes as we do this i m gonna come along and ask you where you are on your rpe chart periodically cause i want to know how your body s feeling just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are okay let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here real quick put your hands on the sensors let s get that heart rate checked as soon as you get that heart rate check go ahead and stop your machine hop off and we re gonna record that under heart rate one real quick under the warm up okay stop your machine there record that heart rate as soon as we get this go ahead lay those back off to the side we re gonna hop back over here and we re gonna start goin through the workout now the workout s gonna be 10 minutes again bikes you outta be pumpin out about 80 to 85 of your rpms there ellipticals probably somewhere between 70 and 75 we really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you re within that target heart rate zone anybody right now in their target heart rate zone no no a little bit elevated from the resting though yes okay all right let s go ahead and start at the five minute mark we will check it again and we will check that heart rate what your heart rate is we won t get off the machines again until the work out s over caroline now again on your own once we get into this a couple minutes on your own if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors you re more than welcome to do that you just don t want to do it the whole time you re working out and that ll kind of give you an idea where you re standing if you need if you re below your lower end of that target heart rate go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit if that s the case as we continue on through this are you all doin good where are we on the chart at 3 that s good you all could do this for an hour huh there you go how you doin over there where are you on your chart two that s good three three two i d say around two two two ladies how we doin over here how you feelin on your chart three three yeah you good russell yeah okay andy how you feelin where are you on your chart about four how do you feel good where are you on your chart doin good most of you you re all about a two three four range right now now we re just getting to the start of the work out but here in a few minutes that s probably gonna change might be changing right now probably startin to feel a little bit of fatigue breathing s becoming a little bit more difficult we re gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes again remember i want you mental picture in your mind how is my body feeling when i m in that target heart rate range doing a good job good job okay we got one more minute and we re gonna get a heart rate check here if you re feelin like your in that 4 to 6 range you might be able to go ahead and up your up your intensity just a little bit there up your speed maybe up your resistance a little bit russell did you forget to put your phone on vibrate yeah that s all right buddy just don t mess with it while you re on the bike okay i mean while you re on the treadmill okay okay hard to do hard to do anything with a phone while you re running all right let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here get a quick check remember what this number is this is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart we want to be within that range now if you re not we need to up your resistance if you re at the lower end i want to try to get on up towards the higher end about that 80 mark so if that s the case bump your speed a little bit up your resistance if you need to we re gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes about 65 i m in my range nice nice where are you on your rpe chart uh about four about four four or five hey anytime you know if you re saying god i just can t get my heart rate up there if you re on the treadmill increase that elevation a little bit elliptical if you increase the resistance then you ll start to feel it how s callie back here she s startin to get it right now aren t ya how are you all on your chart five or six where are you all on your chart five five six where are you guys on your chart probably around four ladies how we doin where are you on your chart about six six yes how are you russell six seven how about you six six dale where are you three four three four you need to increase your resistance i mean your elevation a little bit how about you four four most of you are comin up on that chart comin up okay we re gettin ready to do another check here good a couple more minutes here everybody doing okay yup are you startin to feel some of the signs we talked about fatigue in the legs yes i know it s hard to talk right now a little more difficult breathing startin to feel it a little bit more now aren t you yeah a little bit how s it going back here my legs are like rubber so now you know you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same rpms one mile kyle okay in thirty seconds here we re gonna get a heart rate check then we re going into the cool down you really push it right here you re about to jump off the elliptical aren t you good okay let s get a heart rate check here heart rate check grab those sensors remember this number when you get this number when you ve got this go ahead and bring your speed on down we re goin into the cool down phase make sure you remember what that number was what was your heart rate uh 170 i m about 169 in your cool down phase now there you go good good did we get in there in your range in your range everybody in your range great good job did you stay in heart rate range good now did anybody on that rpe chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine yes you did yes up there all right did ya ll get in your range yup did you get within your range was ya ll on your upper end or towards the lower end upper end tried to go up how about you guys did you get in your range there yeah yeah now here in about 45 more seconds we re gonna get our last check here on the cool down you ll notice how quickly as you do this you ll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout and even after this two minute cool down here the difference between where that heart rate drops to are ya ll okay okay let s go ahead and get that last heart rate check,1.0
we started testing out our theory that it s an exponential cause we found out that the ratios does that verify that it s an exponential equation we thought it did but it doesn t so why aren t you sure i don t know so the more disks i add i m eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that i can make isn t that a logistic function so logistic function would say that you re gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make and it would say at some point you re gonna slow down the number of moves you re adding on does that make sense based on what you ve done so far no not at all what do you think is gonna happen instead that it would increase and what would that be that s the exponential but the numbers are all really long decimals so i heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this so have you looked at your scatter plot yes okay what might be other ways to change an exponential function i can get it out of my backpack based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio before you did any of the arithmetic what did you think your ratio might be small i don t know i didn t really think it was two automatically but two s in your head why is two in your head because doubling because there s doubling here s what i m gonna suggest to you guys you ve got your scatter plot on marissa s calculator right you re thinking that two might have been the ratio why don t you graph two y equals two to the x and compare it to what s happening on your scatter plot and see if there s a different way that you might be able to change the extremum it s increasing by a factor of 2 she s trying it in an actual game normally i d want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds we re at 20 so what s your goal 27 28 29 30 31 good job caitlyn good job now i m convinced that that works you re seeing that the difference is doubling each time correct what kind of function is that suggesting exponential and what do you suspect is probably your factor two two so that s what i want you to look at how could you verify that it s an exponential function using any of the tools you have here once you ve found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is there is a little bit of a trick to this one it has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions okay figure out that when you get stuck again let me know and i ll be back so you think that s two to the power of x minus one why did you get minus one because with one it worked fine but with two when you try to put in x as the exponent two to the x so two times two is four so far x minus 1 is the exponent what i m hearing is that you re convinced that the factor is two and you re trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here is that correct talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you re adding the one at the end because there has to be at least one move we added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first oh wait that doesn t work though if you have one so two to the zero is 1 and one plus one is two but that s tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end you said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one is it a piece of the function that would be really mean we were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end i think you guys are in a great place i think you ve got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table so try more with the transformation i also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move but i would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves that s just that you need at least one move alright i m going to leave you guys to think i ll come back so we found the equation but now we re stuck at number four okay so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it the difference between i was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference so how it would relate to the y values we saw the two to the x we figured oh well two to the four to the 16 well how do we get to 15 minus one this is going back to the algebra from last year so you saw that you had two to the x you noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra you also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot did it lie directly on your scatter plot no so what do you mean by it matched up it was close it was the same curve so how did you know that created a transformation because whether it depends on the number or which value it is it changed the steepness of it so we just knew it transformed it somehow like we had to have it it wasn t the parent function so what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x how did you know that because if you d done four times two to the x you would have stretched it because it would have moved to the left too on the graph and what did that end up doing to your y intercept okay so that would be my next question for you i agree with you guys that definitely there s a transformation i agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables you ve done a nice job with that so how does a transformation what you ve done is you ve taken two to the x what does the minus one do does that move this to the left move it up or down well if you graph it it moves it up okay so jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function and you re saying that you don t think the slope changes okay so you change the y intercept and do you have a change in the y intercept it s still zero comma zero so you just had two to the x find out just two to the x what s the y intercept of the graph what happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that the y intercept moved down and does that match what we ve been talking about you take the function and subtract the value and move down one alright you guys said you were stuck on number four yeah okay why are you stuck so we figured out that you put but the minus one doesn t do anything yeah the numbers are so big that it doesn t matter it actually does change the actual number a little teeny tiny bit but our calculator can t see that number it looks like the same number on your calculator so we have a number of moves if each move is a second then how long is it gonna take for the world to end alright now you guys are also at the challenge question down here which is based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made okay and i ll be back in a little bit i m going to give you guys about seven more minutes you should answer question four before you try that so i got it kind of close looking at just i did what you do to find a normal exponential equation i plugged in y two over y one and then to the square root of four and are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours no you guys are correct that this is exponential but if we re not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation is on the right track so i really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values okay i m gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have alright what have you guys got our answer was 30 talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works i realized that the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one so you just have that in your head did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head we didn t graph it we used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one went to the table and it was the same numbers and i noticed here you ve got 2 to the 64th minus one what s that for that s from another number it s like a really high number one point eight times two to the 19th while you guys figure out how long it s gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number i d also like you to think about the answer to the challenge you guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved so i d like you to think about why your function has two to the x why are you doubling those,1.0
so here s the first set i thought i d start a little bit easy so go ahead and within your groups now i ll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate how to figure out which one it is okay go ahead you can uh you can you use beer s law for this right you aren t able to taste that you aren t able to that s not big enough our okay so doesn t dissociate how s the temperature boil it yeah that s the only way so the one with the highest concentration s going to have the highest boiling point yeah you could freeze it and weigh it okay freezing it the point three would have the most weight weight yeah but which one would freeze first point one point one would freeze first because there s less okay what else point three weighs more but we would need to freeze it first no what we wouldn t need to freeze it the first one being would be with the tasting one or the volume one i don t know the tasting one okay you say the tasting one you say the volume one whichever one comes first the one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one right okay so the one that boils the fastest point one you could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes alright so we can have equal volumes of each solution right and then after like a certain time alright that s it everybody stop stop stop stop okay so who want to go first we ll start with with miles i think you had your hand up first so go ahead what s one way that you can identify these things well you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0 3 molar 0 2 would be the middle and 0 1 would be the least okay if they were all the same volume ahh yeah you guys heard that now good good listening skills on that if they were the same volume at the beginning alright does everybody agree so one method is boil away and weigh did you say weigh how do you know which one has the most i would imagine you could weigh it right you could weight it start with equal volumes okay there s several other ways how about joseph if you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration okay anybody have comments on that jimmy i don t think we re able to distinguish the taste that well because our mouth isn t that sensitive okay miles what if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there so there s two concerns obviously i think miles is the most important you know you guys can see that i m smart enough to put the right substances i keep forgetting i m getting old and i may go in the back and i reach for the lead nitrate or something right and then the other part what do you guys think of the other part could you taste the difference between a 0 2 0 3 and a 0 1 and just say ah that s the sweetest one it s kind of hard miles you d need some salt the problem i think is this is something we would actually need to try right i don t think this is a theoretical thing that we re trying to we re practicing theory here we would actually have to do this in a lab right i would imagine we would wouldn t it be different for every person because we could it could be different for every person right because i can t see as well as you for example maybe right so there could be variations in tasting of those ian given excess humans oh wait you re on the next one no on this one alright i didn t get that either okay so let s look at another method alright we re not going to list that one because we don t want to be tasting things okay so paran your group what about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0 1 would have the most and 0 3 would have the least because there s more sugar covering it what do you guys think okay juan he didn t say how you could measure it the way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure everybody agree yeah okay so that was my concern too right how do you measure the vapor pressure you re not wrong but how do measure it and thank you juan for bringing that up could you repeat that okay so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they d always be evaporating the one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0 1 molar would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time so i m going to write this as evaporation rate who s got another method different view alright jimmy okay so you re gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 then the second one is 0 2 the last one 0 1 what do you guys think could you repeat that so you re going to take equal amounts take it into the light make sure it s the same conditions for each one and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 second is 0 2 last is 0 1 what do you guys think i know some of you guys are thinking that s bio but you took it most of you at least right so we could finish this what do you think wouldn t it take a long time for the algae to start growing it s going to work right nobody sees where s the algae you re always asking me come one folks you think about this i m going to say the problems but i want you to tell me first alright alright let s go with ivan i don t think the results would be consistent because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason so because you didn t mention how much algae you put in there could be an issue there what else though no juan you go alright i don t think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place so i think juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things not just amount of sugar and amount of water there could be other nutrients is that what you re saying yeah nutrients and other things of that sort could i just back up for a sec algae produces sugar right assuming that you re talking about algae that grows they use carbon dioxide so my hunch is there s several right one i think as ivan pointed out you ve got to put in a certain amount why don t you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end you picked algae so yeah although is that a bad idea it could work but we have to be careful with conditions a lot of conditions need to be met anything else you boil them hold on let these guys go if you have equal volumes and you add heat to them 0 1 should boil first okay so you could use boiling point elevation i wrote this down before we even discussed it but everybody agrees that works right so what s another easy one that we boiling point elevation right you need me to repeat that or you got it what immediately follows with that idea freezing point depression freezing point depression okay what else i have a question for you then could we use beer s law for this no tell me why could we use beer s law for this ian you have your hand up at first glace i would say no because i do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution what do you guys think yep don t you need color unless what unless come on keep going with this stuff not you ian you spoke i d like to have as many people participate as possible alright nick go ahead you could add food coloring possibly yeah you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker possibly nick we re trying to figure out the difference between these right yeah what do you mean add you mean add a drop to each of these yeah but then what would you be measuring the food coloring you wouldn t be measuring the sugar you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean you re still okay with that uh i don t know wait nick if you add food coloring how much one drop yeah okay one drop to each of these right now they all look the same don t they yeah and if i stick this in my spectral photometer they should all measure the same did i succeed in figuring out which one is which you understand that right yeah yeah okay nat could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads that s interesting could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads you d have to indicate that high concentration would teacher hang on but once again we have to be careful of conditions right all the temperatures have to be the same what do you guys think sure why would that work because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it s not able to spread through the molecules so that would be in the 0 3 science glad you like it alright how about wait gevorg hasn t spoken so i m thinking gevorg it s your turn buddy what did you want to add you wanted to add a new technique okay go ahead if we did a benedict s test i don t know if it would just turn the same color because i m not sure how the benedict s reacts with different concentrations but maybe if you put the same amount of benedict s and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test what do you guys think benedict s is a reaction between this benedict s stuff with sugar to show the presence of sugar what comes out of the reaction i m not sure but it s a color change oh well the more color change but if the color change is too intense it could just be like it s all going to change that color or not see what i m saying that s what your pointing out right so again that sounds like an experimental one could i share one more how about this you know when you take your ap test you just don t know what and we started with something that i think is sort of easy could you use density what do you guys think someone who hasn t talked yet could we use density and how do we use density what do you guys think no alright ian since nobody s going for it do i have to say it go ahead and say it tell me how tell us how take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it exactly which one s going to weigh the most the one that has the most sugar okay if you take equal volumes this one will weigh the most this will be the most dense the more sugar you add the denser it gets you know this right does anybody have any more alright let s move on set number two now this says solid and i m trying to get you to see a different range on these go ahead and talk about it i ll give you a minute or so colors conductivity we could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity well they re solid you have to remember so solid has a lot of problems with it that s just solving it it s hard to conduct a current well you could dissolve it it s doable it s just a little difficult potassium then um wait calcium what about ph sensing so cacl2 well they re solids oh if you put them into a solvent yeah can we put them into solvents can we make it into so lead can t dissolve in water right lead i mean lead chloride no lead chloride will not dissolve in water but then kcl and cacl2 would they would so you can rule that out that s one way but then how do you figure out between the other solution couldn t there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate i wouldn t say form a precipitate i would say actually i m thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn t dissolve at all with boiling point elevation freezing point depression because you re going to have more little bits in the cacl2 than the kcl as an end result calcium chloride potassium chloride get what pbcl2 does nothing so after that if you boil it right calcium chloride potassium the higher value alright you guys that s it let s gather up okay some of you guys just got back so you guys know what we re doing right yes okay let s get it together alright everybody stop now christina you had your hand up first take the easiest one what s the easiest way to distinguish these you could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them and then pbcl2 would be the heaviest and the kcl would be the lightest equal volumes i mean equal amounts what s an amount though like grams but if i take equal grams then i could have ten grams of this ten grams of this ten grams of that no i didn t say that alright what did you say then i meant like equal equal what volume volume okay now let s answer that one what do you guys think she s saying take let s say 10 milliliters 10 milliliters 10 milliliters and this one s going to weigh the most this one would weigh which one s second oh sorry second would be cacl2 okay so this one would be second what do you guys think someone other than ian okay ian go ahead does atomic weight atomic mass directly influence listen to this miles does atomic mass directly influence density that s the question does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids they re all ionic compounds and the answer to that is no you cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass that this is the most dense okay where just to follow that up where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works ivan oh wait let s give it to him just he s just walked in niresh is it in gases gases right does everybody agree gases you could do that if the formula mass is high on a gas then it s going to have more density could you do that for liquids now could you do that for liquids ivan you could do it if it s all the same subsets for different concentrations,1.0
you each have your own set and i m going to ask you to put them out in front of you in in so you can see all the words can we put them in two rows one two three four five six let s put them in two rows one two three four five six now i wanna play wait a minute show me i m going to ask you to point so get your pointer finger in show me under yes under good take a look at the word under good wait keep it there show me now be careful we want to get all the letters show me there listen to the word good jessica there that s okay he s gotta look he s gonna do it very good put it down good ready alright be careful with this one listen to my words ready show me saw good excellent alright show me ready they alright excellent alright show me was wow that s good show me want alright now you did a great job now we re going to hide your words so turn your cards over all by yourself now you can t see them right keep them in the rows good alright keep them in a row alright now oh your going to do it that way okay wait a minute now now we re going to take turns let s see who s sitting nicely alright you re going to turn over a card lewis and tell me what the word is put it down want i want my toys i want my toys yes good you turn over a card oh what s your word under i see the cat under the bed alright lewis turn over another card under oh you got under as well what s your sentence i am hiding under the bed i am hiding under the bed that s a good one under the table let s see jessica go ahead do another one now think look at your letters was yes i was eating i was eating good look at your letters let them help you don t help they there there yes there is my toy in the bed there is my toy in the bed okay alright how about you jess oh what do you have there good can you use it there is a car in my mail there is a car in your mail wow that would be interesting alright lewis your turn now look at your letters let them help you they yes they was a cat in my car okay this there was a cat in my car they tried to get the cat out of the car okay they belongs means people they okay let s see what you have oh look at you today is the day aaah this word is they the children that would be they let s take a look at this word this is one we are misunderstanding they jessica and lewis they came to the reading group okay they had turkey for thanksgiving they have alright they came to my birthday they came to my birthday can you think of a sentence for they they what did your brothers do they play basketball there you go they play basketball there you go that s better okay you have another card to turn over but it s my turn i got mixed up i got lakers socks you got what nothing say that again what did you say about the i got socks no this is saw this is i saw you when i i saw a movie i saw a big alligator i saw a big alligator i saw a dinosaur i saw a dinosaur last one was was okay where was my friend where was my friend good i want candy i want candy okay now watch what i m going to do i m going to put the cards together i m going to mix them up and i m going to turn them over we re going to play our matching game okay alright what happened my brother put gum in there and when i point i can t get out of there oh boy alright now jessica you went first before right so we have lewis go first this time would that be fair yes alright lewis you re going to turn over a card you re going now listen to me listen to me this is how we re going to play you re going to turn over a card and you re going to read it then you re going to turn over another card then you re going to read it wait a minute wait a minute if look at me sweetie if you get a match you want to keep the pair you have to put the word in a sentence can you do that let s see go ahead okay take a look take a look take a look shh don t tell him don t tell him was this word is was let s see okay now pay attention jessica so you can remember where they are your turn pick another card lewis oh it s so close what word is this saw saw okay here is was turn it over turn it over and here s saw good okay jessica s turn want good want she read it they not a match good wait a minute wait a minute wait before you do that wait before you do that they want they want candy okay watch lewis who remembers what was this one what was this one no peeking do you remember what it was jessica was was good what was this one saw what was this one they and what was this one want good alright they no its not they careful take another close look look at the whole word there now sorry about that good good they is it a match is that a match no but we ve seen that word what s this word they go to your chair now and sit okay there and they i m going to hide them again now let s see if jessica remembers they and they okay now stop you want to use it in a sentence let s see how we do they have a dog they have a dog good job alright you get that one okay lewis let s see how you do go ahead you can do it oh what s that word under under pick another one under no way alright under okay let s see a nice sentence i m going to listen for a good one i am under my brother can t find me because i m under the table your brother can t find you because you re under the table can you give me a sentence for under um i hide under the bed i hide under the bed excellent okay now it s jessi oh want do you remember where it was jessica wow now wait a minute let s see if you can think of a sentence jessica first i want a cake i want a cake what would you want i want a brownie i want a ice cream okay okay alright try another one oh is that match no no what s this word lewis they come back over here and take a good look at it this word is saw jessica s going to get it now wait a minute maybe not maybe not saw uh eh eh ah uh was was okay yeah but that s okay those two we mixed up let s take a good close look at them which one is was which one is saw okay alright now listen to your first sound i m going to hide them again let s see if we can remember go ahead lewis your turn was and which one was there you go was give me a sentence for was i was in my bed i was in my bed let s hear jessica s sentence for was i was i was in the bus i was in the bus alright let s see pick another one take a look at the first letter saw okay and what s that one saw okay now a sentence for saw wait a minute before you count your card a sentence for saw i saw something you see oh i saw a saw a candy you saw a candy where was the candy on the floor i saw candy on the floor did your little brother dump it on the floor okay i would eat it you have the last one they it s not they i want you to think again look at all the letters don t tell him don t tell him there okay give me a sentence wait a minute give me a sentence with it there was a huge table there was a huge table where in my kitchen there was a huge table in my kitchen before you count your cards can you give me a sentence with the word there there is a snowman at the window there is a snowman on the window what a great sentence how many cards do you have one two three four five six seven i got six alright we re going to do one more thing with these words to practice we have a word that we are having trouble with we re going to come over here over to the board we re going to take a look at this word that we re having trouble with thank you for getting her a marker i m going to ask you to write this word on the board oh a line you know what she s telling you right okay let s take a look at this word are you ready this word is jess that s good alright this word is saw let s see if we can write it saw jessica i want you to write saw look at the word there it is saw okay,1.0
everybody s using their directions they have their tools and their charts out we ve found today s date so we know where we re going to record today it s wednesday march ninth i know what numbers down of zero mean they are negative numbers that s what are numbers that are down from zero ok i have most friends with their hands on their heads i want to make sure everybody s listening and ready to move on we can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them excellent i m waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads so we can concentrate on the teacher in each group i have one team member that will be measuring temperature if you are measuring the temperature please hold up your tool that you ll be using those of you measuring the temperature what tool are you using everybody thermometer very good the people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers please line up at the back door of the classroom when you get out there boys and girls are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there what are you going to have to do look at the thermometer and you can also compare it to the thermometer that s been outside so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside if you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind i would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom you guys can use the compass and work together go ahead out and see what you observe if you have an anemometer to measure wind speed you may line up if you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges you may line up you may all go and last but definitely not least if you are measuring the when we look at this our thingy goes away no yours is 61 no it s the fahrenheit not the celsius there s something in there what team are you 66 you guys we need to wait for how many seconds it s not ready yet you ve been doing it at home what is it that you ve been waiting how can it be 110 how can it be now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around ok so see where your is and get ready to start counting look at the bee i ve heard both of these ladies say two what you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means what is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds look with your eye with one eye look at this one i can t see i think it s going west when you have completed measuring you may walk back to your group to record your data quietly i got 66 can we compare it to what s on the wall there and see what we have it got 66 then it got 65 and then it got 64 victor could you explain it all to me why you think you thermometer keeps going down because it gets colder and where has the thermometer been sitting all day in there and do you think it s cooler out here or is it warmer out here cooler exactly so our temperature is going down good so let s go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that s been staying outside it s getting brown what do we think the temperature is there it says the temperature is 46 degrees that s probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long all right you can head back in and record i don t know which number to choose the one on the outside the whole time what s your gym it s on wednesday march ninth it was west the wind direction was west the wind direction was west very good i think that you have an accurate reading what s the wind speed it s cloudy wind direction temperature team three is working together and team two and team one nice job working together i think you have to change it temperature victor what was the temperature 40 degrees 46 degrees fahrenheit it was 50 what was the wind speed it s not raining so what did you guys think the was i agree with you why would we forecast that it might rain what s the weather the weather is rainy west put west it was west it was west we found out that the wind speed we said it went around about that many times so how fast is the wind actually going minutes miles per hour we don t go anywhere in a minute we travel like we said in cars in miles right go back to your group they ll tell you on the chart my thermometer s higher than the one outside we discussed that while we were standing out there why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you re holding it inside right now because inside of you it s warm because you told us that it was when you re holding the thermometer the thermometer only feels what s around it and if we re covering the thermometer it can t measure any more temperature only how our temperature is very good so linda if that answered your question that s why we compared it to the thermometer that s been staying outside that we check each day what are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there 46 degrees fahrenheit excellent so make sure you re sharing that and each person in your group use your data linda i think you ve done an excellent job ok we have a few minutes left and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments i am going to pass out your follow up questions and you re going to use data from last week and compare it to today s data to do some equations on here and you do not have to finish today we will do this in our follow up lesson in our next science lesson ok you may continue working thank you write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up ok the wind direction who should you be asking that to today s last wednesday the temperature was what is the degrees between today s temperature and the temperature last wednesday write an equation show your work last wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour what is the difference between you already have your paper i know we can do it by ourselves but it says to work as a team i like it good job keep working with your team i hear her saying excellent i like how i see brianna using her data and grace starting to write an equation and abby and samaya have the date on their paper you guys are all doing an excellent job who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went you should ask that person as soon as he comes back he should have his data on his chart what number did you put there we worked together and we figured it out i know this one i know this one i know that one one second,1.0
stationary point did he move okay some of the other groups are moving their fingers around sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here so do you think your data might be a little more realistic yeah yeah okay so now one thing what type of formation do you guys have good put an adjective in front of it extremely strong strong a strong positive do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same no no okay so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones remember that correlation coefficient r it went from positive one to negative one or zero oh yeah what do you think yours would be close to one it d be really close to then we ll get to that shortly guys later on okay so you probably would have one that s a decimal 999 or really close okay so you re trying to find your slope yeah so what is your slope two two okay so over here we re gonna put and now does everyone have the exact same you do pretty much oh most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line okay here s the slope so you just told me your slope is two now what am i asking you to do what is your no we re not done yet what is your it s 2 0 read the question okay what s the slope of the equation the slope is what did you just tell me oh two two okay now what s the real world meaning of that what does that mean when you say yes those are two okay now we can go back to that i just want to talk to you about the solution just on your slope you said it was two that was perfect but now what s the real world meaning so the slope is the more rubber band what are you looking at so it s one and two one why can t it so you want to put five okay ten over okay so now you re telling me your slope is ten over one okay well i m asking you what s your slope now you re saying your slope is 10 that s what the slope is but i want the real world meaning so what were you saying for every one rubber band that drops how do you know how do you know but where are you getting i need a little more detail though it s dropping what so 10 centimeters for every one one rubber band okay now what s your y intercept seven seven now is your y intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location what s the y intercept because a slope isn t that directions to get somewhere else what s the y intercept i want the entire it s zero seven so can you write zero seven down please write zero seven down and now tell me what the real when i ask you what the y intercept is yes zero seven now what s the real world meaning subtract out of seven so what s this saying translate that for me you re saying there s no real world meaning what s that saying so before we put any rubber bands on this already moves seven centimeters what does that mean going into this lab did i know if the real world meaning was gonna make sense or not there s been a few groups today their y intercept has a real world meaning zero zero but did i know where your line was gonna go no but if it went straight through zero would that make sense zero rubber band so so what s the real world meaning well what do you think this y intercept that you had does it have a real world meaning no so yeah it doesn t have a real world meaning what slope did it okay once again did i know that coming in depended on your data good job guys you re asking if you plug into this four times three that s 12 but yeah three two and four i think it says three okay so what s your equation y equals 3x plus 12 okay so let s talk about that no no it s one intercept the y it really doesn t play out with that algorithm it makes no absolute sense whatsoever yeah but you find air oh that makes sense but this what are we talking about we got one anyway but really that s it wait one second backtrack for one second so what did you say here five thirds what is a five thirds 5 3 okay so what s the real world meaning every five inches there is three rubber band okay so now does the ball go on a rubber band so flip that around so you re saying two rubber bands the figure is going yes okay does that have real world meaning does that have real world meaning yeah yeah okay now you re saying what your y intercept is can i see your graph paper for a second yeah okay so yeah it looks like it s around does everybody have the same no do you think everyone s gonna get the exact same line we didn t really have an intercept slope we just looked at we just yeah which sounds great because you re all gonna draw that line slightly different so go with one then what does that y intercept is that directions or is that a location it s a location isn t it so can you write the exact location because you re only counting one what s the order of pairs here you have a pair of zero one so write that down pair of zero ones you have a pair of zero ones yeah what s zero represent zero rubber bands zero rubber bands so when zero rubber bands were attached how far did that one one inch does that make sense to you so when there s zero rubber bands attached you figure out one inch alright let s demonstrate that let s see can i see that for one sec please okay let s go back to before we started zero rubber bands attached what s happening okay what s happening right now zero rubber bands did he already move one inch no so does the y intercept come in no no you said because you just told me it was five inches of three yeah what are we discussing now the data or the equation for the okay now so does this y intercept make sense no zero rubber bands are removed so does the y intercept have real world meaning no does the slope have real world meaning yeah did i know your y intercept wasn t gonna have real world meaning yes no because there s some people today that actually have real world meaning what would be a y intercept if it made sense zero zero zero zero zero rubber bands equals zero inches zero inches what were you saying your slope was so let s discuss three the slope is three what s the real world meaning how many rubber bands would you need in your description grabbing one rubber band does that make sense okay now so now what anout your y intercept would be at 12 now you gotta figure let s discuss this right here now i think you re thinking ahead but this line looks like it s crossing up here to where is it crossing it s crossing at we re going up three look three six seven yeah i was looking like around four so let s discuss this you have six that could be perfect but we know the exact way a line likes to go let s go with monique six what s that saying let s go to a pair to the y intercept zero pair zero six so what does that mean so write that down zero pair zero six for the y intercept and what s that actually mean zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches so this was the figure zero rubber bands attached does that make it already move six inches does that make any sense at all so does the y intercept have real world meaning could it still have real world meaning you were thinking ahead i think when you drew your line because what s the only y intercept that makes sense here zero rubber bands 81 inches but you didn t move but does that mean you can decide i want to make real world meaning and just draw my line down the zero because what am i looking for the equation for the line of is yours the equation for the line now your y intercept makes sense if you knew the equation for the y intercept you plug in 81 inches for x right did you end up with a negative you re fine you what minus what oh minus one i wanna discuss it if you re y intercept is what s the order of pairs zero negative one so what s the real world meaning what s that mean what s the zero represent okay so zero rubber bands what s your y interception at zero rubber bands how far does it go now negative one did he already go one or did he reach it so does that make sense zero rubber bands and he s already traveled one does that make any sense so does the y intercept does that mean your y intercept just didn t end up happening yeah when you know how to use this it works with zero rubber bands how fast are you going zero zero okay does that mean your data s all wrong no that s the way your numbers work could you slope this out instead three what s that mean three three what four is still five is so three three what let s go and do number five distance so what would your distance be inches so it s like three inches is over one so that makes sense so does your slope have real world meaning yeah okay,1.0
about 33 33 so 150 plus 33 180 what d you get 180 180 so is that did we double went a little higher went a little higher so you guys made a good prediction didn t you all right keep doing your trials nice work heads up madison heads up ah can you stop it no you re good all right so what have you guys found out so far we ve been increasing but then we just it increased a little but i think we re gonna increase a little more okay so you re measuring you ve all you ve raised your ramp to 10 yes all right all right now what was your prediction it would go farther based on height because like from all the other experiments that we ve done uh huh it s gone farther so and it has more force if the ramp is higher okay man that ambulance that thing moves all right what did you guys get mary robin when you measured we got 179 179 okay what was weird is that like what s weird is that on the first trial we got 130 and then we went to like the like 50s and things okay and then we went back to like the 80s and 90s yeah all right so now we need to go ahead and do what you ve done your three trials what s the next average average all right let s see we got 182 172 and 179 533 533 and then what are you going to do divide it by three okay divide by three 177 666667 so we can round that up to to 178 178 is that pretty close so you got your trials are pretty close together 182 172 and 179 so you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp was that true yes so your prediction came true let s turn over the back side and let s finish the rest of that lab part so were there any trials that your team did not record we only did it we didn t do that one because it flipped off it like hit this chip card and it just like went whoo it went like all right that s a good one not to include let s write that down we didn t include one because it hit a chip hard yeah yeah that s good it just like flew off to the side and it went all the way like did it really yeah it just that s crazy it was funny because it was also funny because it was going straight but then it just that s weird turned that s weird that it hit that that that caused it to you know make such a turn but then like the whole time it s been going to the the right side oh okay so it s been curving yeah it kind of like tilted and that s a good idea yeah that s a real good idea okay so question two what was the average distance the jeep rolled with the five centimeter height so the five centimeter height on the back side of that we got an average of 30 93 93 all right so write that one down 93 did that surprise you it would go 93 yeah yeah is that farther that s what you thought i never thought we d actually get to the end of it yeah that s a but then we actually did with those little toy cars yeah and this is actually an older looking toy car yeah because whenever i roll one wheel the other wheel rolls just a little oh yeah okay so you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it yeah okay but i never thought it would actually go that far okay so you re now on number three right what was the average distance the jeep rolled 10 centimeter height that was 178 okay so 178 it looks like the next question is did the jeep roll shorter or longer distance longer longer can we figure out how much farther yes what would we have to do the 10 centimeter average minus the 5 centimeter average and then your answer would be how like the distance between well why don t you do that why don t you pull that up the 178 you know it s always better when you can incorporate those into your answers you know it increased by one or it was 85 higher it s always better when you can show your answer with data when you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid right all right so maybe can include that and then move on to that number five there okay all right you guys are doing a great job hey have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side did you read all these first you gotta read this whole section of your lab first okay yeah so i would read this part first and then move on okay all right all right how you guys doing good all right so you guys have done your first trial on this one now did you do this one here i don t let s look at our directions it says change the ramp back to five centimeters high did you do that no sir okay let s do that all right sandpaper and then i think it doesn t it say it says tile floor it says tile floor so we re going to measure on the tile i get to race it all right are we ready now i m going to move over here now what vehicle we got here you should move over there because it always goes over here oh it always moves over here yeah it has a curve yeah how about if i move back over here will that work all right you ready right here yeah that s good oh you re right good thing i moved i ll hold it down hold that down now in your first experiment annie while they re doing this what did it when you increased the height of the ramp did it increase yeah it went faster it went what it went faster because it had more force okay so it had more force so why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab it had more force all right it s more steeper okay and the more steeper it is the more less friction it would cause so it could go faster okay what was the force that was bringing it down the ramp gravity gravity so you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp the pull of gravity is greater yeah because it s going more okay all right it s going down going faster okay and then when it gets if it gets down safely it ll just go farther because it has more speed okay great all right so we re on trial two aren t we yes let s do it go you do have that it does have that curved roll oh it landed on the on the back of it there s like a cargo of some sort in the back of it is it is there a there s cargo in the 113 wait wait hold on let s double check what i would do maybe is bring your jeep over yeah but then it s 106 no but then it s oh you re on the are you going to the front yeah okay 113 yeah you re right no but then you re going at an angle and you don t let it go yeah i mean either way i think you re going to get a as long as you that s the way we re doing it from here well you know as long as you do the same thing every time then you should be consistent right yeah all right one more roll right one more and then we have it yeah one more roll jordan here we go then we have to add them all up dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun the only thing is that is that farther don t you think it s farther are we ready maybe it s because of me do you think you have anything to do with it yeah you do huh go fire 117 how far 117 117 all right 117 so now wait now thiago the math whiz has to do his math all right so how do you find the average again we do we do we add them all up and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it okay let s do it so we rolled it three times you ready let s find our average pencil please oh you guys aren t even using a calculator no we haven t been we only use it for the division oh you only use it for the division hey i like that sometimes sometimes sometimes we still need it what do you guys got 10 that s zero 10 to zero add up the four and three so 340 so you re going to take 340 and then you re going to divide it divided by three and thiago can usually do that you get 113 3333333 all right well check it out on a calculator just to make sure okay how can you do that in your head without a calculator i don t know yeah but how do you do that what did you say the number was thiago it was 113 33333 all right here we go it s 113 come on thiago 113 333333333 he got it all right nice job man all right so 113 is that pretty consistent though yeah yeah because we had a 113 yeah you did and that was your middle score wasn t it yeah and really if you take the thing and then we gotta do this one no never mind i think if you take four here and you put it here yeah if you take three here put it here then you have one more here yep all right so now what we re going to do it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp which we did and predict whether it s going to go we ll have to redo those won t we yeah so let s erase those because you had the ramp at how high 10 centimeters 10 and we needed to we need to have an equal trial we need to have it at the same distance right yeah so the question is sit up for me jordan i know we got a lot of space here what are we going to do you think it s gonna go shorter or a farther distance it s gonna go shorter why because there s more friction sandpaper s rough so it creates more friction okay slow down the thing okay what do you think when it slows it down it may slow it down and then it says the car starts to turn just because just because it s our car goes out to the side so it goes more to the side all right than it usually does what do you guys think farther or shorter i think it ll go shorter because the gravity may be pulling it down but the sandpaper is really rough like thiago said and it would like stop it to make it not move anymore it would like barely get off the paper okay can you guys like say you re riding your bike and you ride your bike on smooth pavement and then you ride it on a rough surface is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough smooth the smooth right so can we use that to help us make our prediction it actually could be faster on the bumps more because if you hit a bump if you re going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump you could actually go in the air okay maybe all right let s go and test this thing out and see if you guys are right annie while we re setting up this lab can you go ahead and write your prediction and it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there now i can t sit here can i this is the bad seat i gotta move well i say you sit it doesn t go very far anymore on the sandpaper all right well let s set it up there that one there right and that one there four centimeters more all right let s look we went 113 with the sandpaper how far do you think it s gonna go let s make a prediction i think it ll go maybe half that or even less than half that okay so what would half of 113 be what s that close to i don t know i think that would be maybe 500 500 and no you want half of it oh five okay half of it 50 i think there you go 50 yeah 50 all right 52 51 point 50 point like okay all right are we ready for the first roll let s do it let s get our first trial here we go we re ready wait who hasn t rolled has emma not rolled okay all right good i like the way your group s working together there all right here we go oh should we use that trial or should we try a different one try again let s try one more maybe we can get that well scoot it right over here and we could even scoot the sandpaper like there yeah all right you ready all right there it is it didn t even move off the sandpaper let s give it can someone hold that down can someone hold that down please here we go this is our test is the prediction right the sandpaper s hard it is it s rough isn t it yeah 49 now aren t you on the front yeah which would be a 49 yeah but you mean or maybe you re about 50 yeah about 50 you guys were pretty close in your prediction weren t you half it was like 50 yeah jordan said 50 1 2 all right you guys got two more trials right i said 51 1 2 you said 51 1 2 all right ready yeah oh man really let s like keep it down or maybe we ll hold it down next time yeah yeah i think that s the problem it s scooting back that was 50 47 yeah 47 okay almost in half all right i ll hold it on this side are we ready here we go,1.0
you re not doing your job follow the arrow good just a little bit why why do we say the wiffle because it because nothing in it it s holes then is it the holes and nothing in it makes it heavy or light light light good next what do we have to do we have all our arrows down good exactly okay thank you someone needs to hold this here i have a job for you come hold the clip hold this here hold this here come around here come here sweetie right here hold this okay now let s count go to there and i ll help okay good good boy oh no uh oh put it in the basket put it in the basket good you have to help her count i need to hear you should i could count 30 no no it s not far when this is 20 21 good is that more than the wiffle ball this one more than this is this one more sebastian yes good good 52 write your 52 down what s the problem what what have you done here okay i see working on her turn she hasn t done anything because we re not helping what which one did you roll you don t need this you re not to this point yet first you re doing the rolling okay you need to move to the side now help her okay good wait wait wait oh okay good now it s turn okay now you help her by holding the end no it s fine i can tell what it is you re doing a good job someone needs to hold this end right here hold the end right here okay now perfect now we have to help her count so she can write her numbers down okay start with the first one the wiffle ball how far is the wiffle ball starting 10 here is this 10 where s the 10 good you think that s how far it is okay so write that down put in wiffle ball i said i m next i said i m next i m looking now at asked about yours i think you have your numbers in the wrong spot which went further wiffle ball which one which one went far the baseball okay because i think on our list you have them written backwards we ll fix them we ll find them with the right picture okay let s see what the problem is the one s got to go on this side please help her count where the baseball is count with her 14 is there a faster way we could ve done that by doing what by doing what exactly by counting by 10s we could ve started here and gone 20 20 and then count from there you re right good so who s next steven now what s going on here sarah was saying something what s happening no remember you did this together count them 20 well let s look it does look like 3 yes good write it on the board but you two can start and then you two can start you hold the good mark it good where does the ball go put it in the basket excellent help the boys now you can hold the ramp it looks like it s about to fall too late wait wait all the things to say now with the rubber ball exactly this one s called the what wiff wiffle ball wiffle ball what happened with the balls hold it let me look at yours you got yours done what happened with yours what happened with the baseball it went which one went the farthest this one how about yours which one of yours went the farthest yeah the baseball remember we talked about that the ball should be in the basket so it doesn t go under the chair counting what happened no but what happened here someone has to hold it you re right can you hold it good that s better 30 this is 50 50 start again each one 51 pablo which one of the balls went furthest the baseball what did we talk about when we said at the beginning which ball did we think was going to go the farthest the baseball why did you think it was going to go furthest because right yes how about yours and sarah s too did the baseball go the farthest that far that was a hard push exactly that was a soft and that was a soft which one was the softest two which one was a really soft push the wiffle ball why why did we say that because the ball just a little bit what happened when you weighed the ball when you put them in the balance the baseball get s heavier the baseball was heavier baseball needed nine magnet weights you re right you remember it was heavy good you re absolutely right okay help him count to his wiffle ball hold the end,1.0
okay would the person who is currently writing please stand up alright nice and loud what did you guys put and why nicholas carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict to create the perfect amount of work okay very good john nice and loud marie curie okay discovered that radiation okay what about you guys alright two claps for these neighbors sit down pass the board one person what would be this is an opinion question what do you think would be the result if scientists didn t communicate their findings to the community at large go do we need to write this down on the board just give a bullet sentence do we have to pick a scientist for this one to prove it nope this is just an opinion just give me like a one word bullet would be fine okay pass the board one person and would that person please stand up troy what did you guys have there would be multiple theories on how things worked society would be stagnant and newton s hypothesis newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff and he didn t think it was important so when he found out a few months before that he didn t publish it until they asked him about it and then he republished to them so they could hang out with everybody else okay excellent what do you guys have there would be no uniform units therefore there would be no real way to judge one s discovery and you couldn t really bounce one idea off another okay what d you guys have we said that we wouldn t have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done because i know that celsius went off of newton s ideas of how the poles were flat and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were okay very good alright two claps for all our neighbors pass the board one person okay i like this one if you could interview any of the scientists that we ve looked at today who would it be and what one question would you be sure to ask okay go okay stop right there pass the board one person please stand up please stand up who s going from this group andy super okay nice and loud let s use active listening john who would you guys pick and what question would you ask marie curie i said it right and what question would you ask dear if she got any oppression from the male scientists okay the oppression from the male scientists i like it what about you guys we would ask thomas edison what inspired you to create the phonograph excellent okay back there who would you pick and what we were also going to ask thomas edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs of the light bulb specifically okay brandon we had albert einstein and our question would be how did he come up with all his theories if he couldn t pass high school math okay what d you guys put we picked oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this if he realized what he actually made you probably can t see it but they have written on the board the manhattan project okay very good and you guys oppenheimer what his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb okay this is a really great segway to what we re going to do next big claps for all these guys please move into your catwalk formation find a partner go in ten without the boards just yourself just your bodies nine eight seven six five oh we have a partner whose hand is up four looks like there we go three two one be sure to oh we need a real quick hands up don t we hand ripple establish who your partner is wow that was emphatic okay be sure you re using active listening because i will quiz you here s your question how are scientists affected by social issues social issues going on in our culture how does that affect what scientists can and can t do or what they think the person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back go when you re done stand back to back okay face me since this one is kind of a shifting gears one i want to let you volunteer did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave yeah interference from the church okay definitely a social issue if they don t have their research believed they could not receive funding or just get shunned basically if it disagrees with what the society basically believes in okay so you could be shunned you could risk your political or your religious beliefs em problems with morality like testing on animals okay did you guys want to add something down there no no you re good they said what we said basically okay this question is for the other partner why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world think for a few seconds why do scientists try to understand the natural world okay give your answer then stand back to back go okay face me i m going to let you guys volunteer on this one too who had a partner with a really good answer yeah it s just human nature to question things okay very good since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it we just question okay what d you guys have because they re extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do okay so we re very curious creatures how to make things in everyday life easier ooooh that segways to my next question split apart brody take the catwalk logan take the catwalk hey you guys were my first ones last time too aw such love i was the first one last time were you yeah oh i just remember those two catwalking together okay shift us down two super shift down two and a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand super okay the person who has ordered the most id badges this year is going to answer the following question shh here s your question five four three two thank you here s your question what motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs what motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs think about it go okay split apart i m just going to randomly popcorn on this one brandon what d you guys say we came up with make life easier okay to make life easier alright what s something you guys said money and power money and power interesting what s something you guys said to decrease death like medical science okay so let people live longer probably also live more quality lives excellent okay take the catwalk take the catwalk shift down two partners once she gets down there shift down two super and a quick hands up hands hands hands hands hands uh oh there we go hands hands hands hands hands hands hands now everybody take three steps that way one two three super okay this time the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question what evidence can you cite from today s scientists that we ve discussed where something microscopic something you can t see was being sensed or manipulated what is an example of the scientists we learned today hold on just one sec what is an example of something the scientists we learned about today hold on hold on hold on i had a request to restate the question what is an example from the scientists we learned about today using sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can t be seen okay now go we certainly cannot see that except on the macroscopic level we can see the results of it brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster so brandon what was your answer i found on thomas edison found radio waves okay very good face me please emily what s something you guys talked about marie curie found radiation from atoms okay very good erin what s something you guys talked about okay very good take the catwalk take the catwalk on the catwalk alright pg pg pg thank you scooch down and hands up hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands super okay the person whose last digit in their address is the lowest is going to answer this question okay here is your question we talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world what is your opinion of scientists manipulating using for our benefit our natural world okay go okay face me nice and loud so everyone can hear brian what did your group discuss we thought it all depended on humanism how they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world that they feel like they re higher than all the other creatures then they can do what they want to the natural world okay so as long as it s being used for good i guess okay with the benefit of humans or the world in general kind of a socialist view the world in general okay john what did you guys say yeah what did we say pretty much the same thing the same thing pretty much okay so are you specifically looking at human needs or more global human okay what about you guys what did you partnership talk about that it was okay to a point there was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world like taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another okay so who should decide what those points are i don t know okay alright that segways us to the next question if you were let s see let s do this the person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question okay if you were the scientific consultant to president barack obama what percentage of our national budget should be spent on science and why justify that amount go it s a percentage so we re not talking a dollar amount what percentage well it doesn t really matter do you think half of our budget do you think a third of our budget you think a quarter of our budget i don t know you could delineate that okay i could tell by looking at you guys that we ve got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this so spread back apart and face me what did you guys say well i said that 15 is a good amount because then it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need okay now you guys had a very specific take on it what did you guys talk about we talked about if medical if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences as well as it should and if it is then the percentage should be increased to help like 50 to 60 if medical is included okay so we have to look at the different kinds of research are we just studying stuff to study stuff are we developing a technology that will help human need are we looking at medical alright very good take the catwalk take the catwalk on the catwalk they do their little turns on the catwalk on the catwalk okay of the science of the person we haven t scooted oh scoot down i m out of order thank you scoot down i got so excited about the questions scoot down scoot down we will okay here we go we re creatures of habit sometimes hands up real fast make sure you ve got the right partner uh huh uh huh uh huh there we go okay the person whose third no the person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest,1.0
okay so for social needs we said that their social needs are being met because they they look like the slave traders can talk to each other because they speak the same language but the slaves don t so their social needs with each other aren t so you feel your social needs are being met yeah and how so because our person can talk to cause you have people to talk to don t you yeah anybody agree with that i agree because our person you i am you re that person don t say my person cause that s you i can talk to other people so you do have some social interaction so there s some disagreement there as social needs are being met or not no hands nita jump in we cannot so your social needs are not being met yes our social needs are not being met because we they do not understand each other meaning like deaf or they cannot talk so how does that make you feel go ahead and talk about your emotional needs now being met or not being met our emotional needs are not being met right now i think i disagree i think ours are kind of being met i agree with lauren s ours are being met because they re more happy that they re gonna get a lot of money you re the person but our person is kinda serious like he doesn t really want so as far as what nita s already talked about emotionally so are your emotional needs being met he looks angry you feel safe you re good to go yeah cause we know we re she s like i don t really want to go but they want the money but we want money we want all the money well it s the physical needs anyway ours ours are not being met ours are being met cause we get weapons and everything all good food i agree and ours are also being met you don t want to mess with them yeah i disagree with both of you guys because ours are not being met at all definitely not we are like we re starving starving my needs are not being met if i m ashley because i m scrunched together i m uncomfortable my physical needs aren t being met because it s crowded and my muscles ache does anyone agree with that that their physical needs are not being met i agree that ashley s physical needs aren t being met because they are scrunched together and it looks like they re in chains and they don t have much are your physical needs being met yes our physical needs are being met because i disagree with you because i think you have space our physical needs are being met we re not like you re in good shape with your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs how do those kind of all go together talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel based on this picture you re that person so use first person point of view and discuss how those are all intertwined and then add to your conversation as far as i know some of you did the bottom two as far as not these are what are being met and these are not being met so make sure you cover those two okay how they all intertwine or if they do and then you can discuss these bottom questions too even if you didn t get to them with your partner jump in now with each other i ll be right back alright so my emotional needs are being met i m earning the money that i should be and i feel confident all of our emotional needs all of our needs are being met why are the clothes taken off and why are the just in case emotional needs are not they do jump overboard being met it looks like they re sad because because we look depressed and you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like our faces and their and our body language and there was and we re scared because we see the weapons and we don t know what they re gonna do with it to us so think about the cause and effect of that our emotional kinda was being met are the people standing up no but how are they not chained still all of our emotional needs are being met they re running away they don t look worried they look kind of like they re looking at the scenery kind of they look calm in their expression they look calm yeah they don t look worried or anything these people but the people that are sitting down i disagree with alan cause they look calm and confident i kinda disagree with that because they look like that s why they re all facing different directions they re watching for anything suspicious they re all looking in different directions they aren t smiling like they re looking at beautiful scenery there s like little sections in between so like grayson said if they do jump overboard they don t all fall over and tip the boat do you think these people are all in one group no let me rewind and say my question again do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had do you understand my question i m not saying it very well were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group yeah you think so how were the roles different i think there s bosses and then there was slaves like slave traders and them kind of serious like they just got their reward and these people they look kind of like chained i don t think they re running away i think they re running away i think they re going to a bigger boat cause these people look like i think they re like that s not the full canoe and they re just taking the slaves to the big boat so let me say my question again let me say my question again why would slaves take slaves they re slave traders they re not slaves how do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders let me say my question again i want you to think about your role and what was just said do you think that all roles that i gave this group were i m sorry are on this picture no oh you re changing your mind discuss that at first you said yes discuss that why maybe not all the roles that i gave you were on this picture no do not say your role yet ladies and gentlemen we have about one minute i think that they are people in the tribe and they re giving their slaves as slaves you know how we were doing that worksheet the graphic organizer it said that most of the time they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones well i think cause they could still have their own slaves i think this is a slave trader well not really like a slave trader but like cause the slave traders a slave boss kind of were from england so i think they d have white skin i think they re with the other people but remember african americans were also slave traders because they re not chained and they re standing and the other people like slaves are all tucked together and depressed i think that some european traders tried to persuade other slave people to say like go get your crime people go get your crime people slaves yeah your slaves in your own tribe and then we ll trade you gold a bag of tobacco and those helped capture so even though they don t have white skin they might be slave traders and they give like so we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders is that what i m hearing you say one being they could have also been threatened to work europeans hold that thought david one being europeans and one being african well not really african american cause in the book it said that the african slaves not the european slaves but the african slaves their slaves were kinda like maids so i want you to think about the role that you were given and i asked you to look at that picture from that perspective is it possible that that specific role i gave you has many different perspectives itself yes alright i want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add and then we re gonna continue tomorrow you re not gonna tell not yet no i changed my mind you think you know you think you know we still have the cards aw rats they did it,1.0
happy tiny small silent little quiet glad right some of these words too you might not even know what they mean but once you work with synonyms a little bit you re going to actually make your vocabulary a little better you re going to learn what more words mean okay so that ll help you read and everything nicolet that s silent and quiet okay you want to come up and match those let me put it on pen okay you have to move over a little bit great okay is she right guys good how did you know that those were synonyms because both of them mean that because both of them mean both of them mean the same thing okay they mean the same thing or what else jabril oh you have another one you want to mark they mean the same thing right you can make up a sentence like we should be quiet in the library and then you could take out the word quiet and put silent in we should be silent in the library that s how you can check it to make sure of it it s like a better word a better word quiet or silent okay fernando you see one okay what do you see oh great can you tell us what you have happy and glad happy and glad okay pick a sentence for those can you think of a sentence i m happy because because my birthday is coming okay i m happy because my birthday is coming let s take out happy you guys can take it and throw it away take out happy and put this word in glad okay now say the sentence with glad i m glad because my birthday is coming alright very good okay you ready jabril you got one okay what did you find smiley and little no small and little okay is he right guys yes he is very good you started to say smiley and little right but then you said wait a minute those aren t what is that called those aren t right synonyms right so then you remembered that word is small and little okay very good anyone else who hasn t gone barbara but there s no words is that all of them alright good no tiny and little oh small little and tiny they all go together don t they that s right there s three words that mean the same thing small tiny and little okay so there can be more than one synonym for a word that s a good point do you guys want to practice saying synonym cause it sounds likes it s hard to say let s clap it ready synonym let s try again synonym let s just slow down a minute syn o nym syn o nym alright we ll keep practicing okay now we need to read these sentences and find out which ones have synonyms okay let s start with this one nicolet can you read that the dog is angry the dog is mad are those synonyms yes which two words angry and mad okay you want to come on up you re going to circle those sentences and that dog look at his face too okay if you re writing you could use the word mad that s kind of like i just call it a first grade word sort of you want to bet a sparkle word so you could say he s angry you could also say he furious the dog is furious that s an even better word right a better synonym jabril you want to do the next one okay can you read these the dog it sick the dog is ill so sick and ill are those synonyms good oh you re getting creative with our circles okay barbara you want to read this one the dog is sad the dog is crying okay are those synonyms yes well sort of he would be crying if he s sad i m not sure that they mean the same thing like if you said barbara fell down and now she is crying right that s something that you do right barbara fell down and now she is sad but it doesn t really mean the same thing it s close you want to try this one the dog is happy the dog is glad okay happy and glad do those mean the same

take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you re going to be working on and this we want to remind you that it s kind of dinner party conversation ish you agree with people at dinner parties you disagree with people at dinner parties but it s civil because it s friends that you invited over to your house you don t raise your you don t raise your hand at dinner parties you wait until you wait until you wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking of course because that s polite dinner conversation you add on to what one another says but like i said we don t necessarily have to agree and then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party somebody else brings something else up so you can raise your own questions as well so the seminar is open and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of the veldt what did it mean like george having like i think that i know a lot of times where he especially in the towards the back he it goes back a little ways he s like talking a lot of things like comments turning comment commen i can t say that word he says they re going to turn the house down possibly for a month and how he pick out the picture painter and he was telling his he was like talking to his son a lot and like about not about doing what his son would not want to have happen and how he spoiled his children so much so he takes out there s a lot of things that his son his son and daughter it just doesn t say as much wouldn t like because yeah but he wasn t like he wasn t like i agree that oh yeah i m gonna go die today i agree that it was he didn t want to die i agree that it was of course he didn t want to die who wants to die except for if you re suici you know suicidal i agree that and on page 15 where it says um it s mostly on 16 but starts on page 15 won t this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children s affections it assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents and now you want to come along and shut it off kind of shows why that they hate them and because it because it s since the nursery is their parents it s like some guy who thinks he can tell you coming along and can tell you to kill your parents you know it s the same thing as they re doing though they re killing their parents well but they think the nursery is their parents they don t think their parents are their parents they don t matter as much as parents if they d been nice to them and now they re going to turn everything off then isn t it imbalanced so now they re relying on the house because that s what they ve learned to do as yeah it d be like take an example people are killing their parents and on page 15 it says like i also think that it s the dad says i sen the psychologist says i sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now you re letting them die in some way so if they like they don t really know like when someone says no to them they ve been spoiled so much they don t even like well they just can t take it it makes them go all crazy and stuff so they wanted to kill them because they like couldn t fly to new york so yeah because i think and if their parents and if their parents and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents then maybe not but since their parents don t really take care of them it s the house that takes care of them yeah and then the the house and the room replaced their parents yeah their parents and friends it s not like the parents could they don t have friends because they re the room they get all these adventures because of the room yeah they don t have friends and they kind of like rely on the house to give them stuff all the time if the house refused them if it could then i don t think that they would want to kill it i think that it s just because they don t feel like their parents are actually their they don t they feel their parents aren t important to them so when they say no on page on page 13 the mom s saying that sounds stressful would i have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it and brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath the kid s like now relying on everything he s never had to do something for himself so he doesn t really like know yeah he s gotten so like stuck on having everyone do things for him he thinks like doing your own thing would be like a challenge yeah like and i guess you can use an example as wall e a show people get like so fat and they rely on everything so much that like they have to move in chairs and they when you golf it s virtual golf there s a robot for you so they just they take robotics and machines to the next level and they it s all they rely on and so many people don t have to work yeah and weren t the ones that like bought the house that they were actually the cause because they were the ones like on page 5 and 11 they even said that we were the ones who bought the house we were the ones who got us into this mess so but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children which made them mad so again they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house i think it like don t you think that people would be sort of obese like elliot said yeah they would be they would be yeah but then they d be like everyone else in the world but then they also yeah and getting exercise but they re obese and also i think that it s george hadley s fault not necessarily both the parents because the mom didn t really do as much because like well the quote over there it said that like she s the one who let them in for a minute but she just wanted to be nice she just wanted to be nice but i think like on page two it says but nothing s too good for our children george said so i don t think it s as much lydia s fault because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there she just wanted to be nice to the kids because george had shut it off so abruptly but i think it s more george s fault that they spoiled them and that therefore gets himself killed does anyone know when this story was written because i m guessing it was 1950 all right because i was i m guessing it was wri i was guessing it was written when women weren t like thought of that highly because wendy only actually speaks once and is a sniveling idiot most of the time and lydia s and lydia hadley is pretty passive and it s the guys that are have all the action and have anything really going on except in the final scene well yeah but that she on she says one line one line in the whole book basically i know but lydia sort of has a bit of action yeah but she doesn t do much she doesn t like she s pretty passive she doesn t like um disagree with her husband or her kids she doesn t do anything like that she just follows whatever her husband says maybe she has a few opinions but not really and wendy says four words alone in the whole thing so well i mean you hear her screaming but other than that is that a word well that was unless she s saying it close enough at the same time as peter like when they both come in and say hello mom and dad doesn t really count or when they both say mommy daddy come quick but she s saying it at the same time she only says four words by herself in the entire story the screams are actually their parents when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being yeah they realized that at the end but they didn t really make that very clear they re like suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar i thought the whole book or the whole story that it was like the kids screams but it s actually the parents what are yeah because it s really not clear on that i figured that it s actually so they all well i m it s more it s nicer to have like a mystery kind of mm hmm yeah i figured that it s the author s fault the what the author s but how is it the author s fault because it s his story well the author wrote it that doesn t make any sense but carl the author yeah that doesn t make much sense it s not his fault it s the it s totally off topic yeah i agree with elise when i didn t really get who the screams were until the very end where they said yeah that i think it s on page um 19 but yeah that they were it says on page screamed and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar so i thought it was the kids the whole time i thought aaron was saying something before but then everyone what i was going to say is the a little while ago when i was going to ask you why do people think it s like peter hadley or other because i mean the other is both of them because more or less the majority did george hadley so why just those people who did that why did they do that i understand with peter hadley because it is his he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents but it s not his fault he got spoiled he can t help it if his parents spoiled him yeah because actually even if the parents had been played more of a parent role they would still probably have preferred the nursery because you don t need to the parents could still say no and the nursery does they can like do whatever they want with it i agree with the both parents part of it even though the mom wasn t as involved as george was the mother was not do posing a part in the kids life as being the mom and the house was so that caused them to think the house was their parents and the house was their family this is indirectly directly i think you can go directly the peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying directly directly but indirect well directly the lions were oh my god indirectly but directly it was mostly peter but indirectly it was it was kind of everybody s fault i kind of agree with like both the parents and then the dad because in the beginning the parents are like slowly taking away some things like the painter and not letting them go to new york and that kind of builds up their anger but in the end the dad just wants to shut it all off and then the son starts getting really mad and like threatening them finally they like get really mad and then they start imagining the parents dying and then they ve been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing i think it was the parents fault and the inventor because i mean none of it would have happened if they wouldn t have had the just like the super technology house and the nursery so it s technology s fault it s not the inventor s fault because he didn t know but it s not the it s not the inventor s fault that they thought though if he wouldn t have made it it would have never happened and also if the dad wouldn t have bought it it would never happened too so that s my two opinions they couldn t but they bought it but they made it and bought it to be a good thing not a bad one no one invented it so that you would so that it d be used as a murder machine they didn t just make it like on the advertisement greatest murder machine ever perfect for murdering your parents we don t know like why he built it maybe it was because of that but you don t know like exactly what his point of the invention was it was to like study the children s thoughts it was to study their minds because the children he said that but what if it s not he s a liar the children were mentally impaired and they needed to be looked up on and they wanted to know what they were thinking so so a psychologist another good quote to show that it was to show that it might have that it could have been the parents fault was that on page 11 it said yeah george said who was it that who was it said children are carpets they should be stepped on occasionally because the parents didn t they didn t do anything to the kids they they didn t really step on them that much until the end they just did what they want they just all of a sudden just like flattened them yeah they just did it so abruptly yeah they just started and let it go it was just like bam you re dead no wonder they wanted them dead guys let s try and talk one person at a time or else we can t hear my turn okay on page 15 it says that the dad went from santa santa to scrooge and like if he would have taken away like one thing at a time over a period of time i don t think the kids would be like like killing them but it says he just took all the good stuff away at once and they got like really mad that s also kind of dangerous though because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter so it was they still could ve gotten mad it s also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away because they get more and more mad all the anger i have another opinion that i was trying to say but then i let fiona go first that s not fair no that s not it s my fault all the anger built up because anyway um,1.0
can you make some shadows i see light how will you make a shadow how are you making a shadow how are you making a shadow alicia my hands what is your hand doing making a shadow how is it making a shadow i don t know how is it making a shadow brandon because your hand is stopping the light your hand is stopping the light and it s small cause your hand is far away from your body and more light comes around your hand what happens if you move it close to the light it has it big because it stops more light because it stops more light it s stopping more light you re right let s go see what these guys are doing what are you guys doing blocking the light from the light in there you re blocking the light how are you blocking it we re going forwards and backwards to make it little so i see your shadow is changing how is it changing because you re closer to the light and then you re when you get close it gets bigger it gets bigger and when you re far it gets littler okay why does that happen what s happening when you re down here it gets big it gets bigger why does it get bigger what happens to the light the light can t go through your hand and and and it s blocking it it s blocking more light what happens over there then it s blocking a little bit of light okay so more light gets around it right alright very good can you guys make different shadows it s a turkey that looks like the red nosed reindeer the red nosed reindeer how are you changing your shadow you have to make shapes of the animals i don t know what to make that s okay make anything you want you guys go ahead make em big and small and i ll be back in a little bit duwant is helping you duwant what s happening over here doing some measuring what are you measuring how come you guys are measuring down here and not in the window because are you able to see the box how come you re not measuring the fifth one where s the sun the sun is on the other side other side of the building way over there so we can t measure the shadow sticks today can we that s why you re making shadow sticks on the ground okay show me a shadow stick okay bristava you can handle the light what can you do can you hold the stick up for us julie to make a shadow okay can you do the measuring okay go ahead and measure it put your hand down here so we can see the top can we measure that stick no we re gonna measure the shadow you wanna measure the stick first and then compare it to the shadow okay you gotta hold that real still don t you is your light high or low low it s lower what happens if you put it lower what happens to the shadow it turns big it grows it grows it gets longer what if we put it high it s gonna be fat gonna be short is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick i need to you to measure it okay let s record it you measure the shadow measure the shadow whoops scuse me let s measure the shadow measure the shadow is that long enough or do you need another hold it still bristava is that long enough is the shadow longer or the stick longer let s compare there s the shadow measurer and there s the stick what do you notice it s the same size it s the same size it sure is what if you did it down here though would it be the same size if you put the ball down here no the shadow would be much longer wouldn t it good work guys keep measuring try a different stick use that pointer stick or another stick here s a stick here s some more sticks for you to try i m done with these things already it s okay okay what are we doing can you guys guess what that is scissors how did you know it was scissors because the shadow okay the shape of the shadow told you didn t it she put on some blocks okay no oh she says no it s not blocks is she tricking you yeah sometimes the shape is hard to tell can you guess adam no take a look at this one adam take a look at this one oh nope not from up here what do you think that is know what this is bryce what is that one can you tell from the shape what this one is gluestick a gluestick you re right good guessing how could you tell shadow of the lid you saw the shadow of the lid good job bryce s turn okay now are you guys gonna play the takeaway game okay remember she s gonna put a whole bunch of objects on there sit down and you grab a good long look and then close your eyes and she ll take one away and you ll have to guess what shadow is missing okay alright what are we doing over here guys what are we doing you re making shadows shadows you re checking out different materials yeah okay so what is that one shelby what did you find out about that one goes through what goes though what goes through the light the light goes through so does it make a shadow yes which part of it makes a shadow boys and girls check your voices please thank you this part okay that thick part makes a shadow doesn t it what about the thin parts doesn t make a shadow does it the light goes right through what else did you try what are you trying takori tell me about it show me why don t you try this trayshawn but wait takori was trying something just a minute what have you got takori a tissue it s what a tissue a tissue is the light going through it or did it stop the light stopped the light it stopped the light so it made a shadow didn t it did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow a dark one okay trayshawn your turn what are you trying the box is it stopping the light get back here so you can see put it down here can you see it what do you see about it it s making a shadow which part is making a shadow the whole thing is that a dark shadow or a light shadow a dark shadow is this part dark or light light okay why is this part light becuase it is a light shadow can t hear you babe because it s a light shadow why is it a light shadow why isn t it a dark shadow what s happening to the light some of the light going through it mm hmm what do you think cooper what s making that shadow um the light okay the light is making the shadow what are we using what is this a box okay is it clear or colored clear okay so what happens to the light it goes through okay it goes through it doesn t it so it only makes a little bit of a shadow good job did you guys write the things over here did you find anything new to write down let s try that shelby you and cooper come over here and try that okay cooper you may go to the bathroom what do you see shelby sorry you see a light shadow why is it light cause it goes right through is any part of that dark this part that part why do you think that part s dark cause it has a wrapper the wrapper and what s the wrapper doing to the light it s stopping the light and it s making a shadow exactly very good shelby thank you go right here okay what s our time we have two minutes left we might wanna go back and see hey what d we find out raja what are we doing here measuring what s your shadow doing can you change your shadow how do you change your shadow by moving by moving by moving the object how else could you change your shadow what about the light what would you do with the light move it move it i ll hold your stick and you move the light how is your shadow changing getting bigger what else could you do move your light some more move it up or down ooh what happened to the shadow it got shorter oh now what s happening got longer didn t it this is making a shadow that s easy to see look at that shadow when the light is high the shadow is shorter short and when the light is low the shadow is alright now measure that measure that how many cubes lie on that shadow one two three four five six seven is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick longer or shorter than the stick the same oh it s the same i think our,1.0
has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees why do you think it s more light around him i don t know just to show that to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture what is the dark force symbolizing why is it a dark force why isn t it like a bright light yeah i don t know it kind of reminds me of what jack said dante started going through the forest it kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff hell s not a very bright place so it reminds me of that one thing the light and religious paintings jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he s pure or more religious but what d you say i said but dante isn t pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn t as pure as like jesus okay so i want to come your statement in a moment because kailyn had something to offer why do you say he s not pure is there any indication that he s not pure well it s kind of an inference because he s man we all assume that the purity is in god or jesus or buddha or whatever he s not because he s man and men have faults women have faults a human being is just not divine i guess but it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously so he kind of is the most pure one not like godlike but he is more pure than the rest i believe so do you think that s why dante went to hell in the first place to go see all the bad people do you think he was going there to learn a lesson or going there to prove that he was right because remember this is a fictional this is fictional so can a character cause you re right we infer that man is sinful but can a fictional character be perfect can be flawless can be sinless and if so is dante trying to go a different way of inference is he trying to infer that he is from what you ve said that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he s not already so can a fictional character be pure one of the questions i think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent i kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything like a wake up call you re going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways they were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing he was considered a fraud by the other team i guess side so i think it s more of a like he s going to there to see what happens when you don t be the best you could be i guess who judges where you go is it the devil or is it a higher power i thought it was the gods that judged that are there gods in this story do we ever hear much about the gods we aren t sure about the gods yeah really who judges where all these people go cause they re talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that we didn t really read the hell part as opposed to the yeah yeah so maybe in the other books it would explain where the gods are and you said who judges where they go and everything technically we don t know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating brutus cassius and judas but in the book on page 41 lines 8 9 minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go so he s kind of like boss of hell sort of forty one lines eight and nine i have a question are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell that s what i find too meaningful but in their own perspective they are different individual yeah so do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far what do you think depends on how far you go down like the pain increases one of my questions are are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do i think it s what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are i think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes couldn t it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life for instance in limbo all these babies that had died and weren t baptized are now there but they hadn t really hurt anybody so they re not being quite as punished as let s say judas who s in the center of hell having his head gnawed on he caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done so it depends on who they put it on yeah so if they just keep it to themselves like gouging out the eyes that s not really hurting anyone else right where s the gouging of the eyes where did you just pull that from what piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out oh i m sorry i got confused oedipus oedipus he punished himself for it in a weird way but do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn t torture other people think before you respond think about it because i want you to respond to this this is huge i want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we re going to do for the end of the year okay so write down your question mainly she has brought up just like i heard you guys doing with these pictures a different text didn t you bring up the odyssey with this yeah do you want me to write oedipus specifically yep write down the gouging of oedipus eyes where would oedipus have ended up in dante s inferno okay so pretty much yep and i want you guys to answer and then i ll move on and come back i love how you bring in another text that s one reason i brought this picture in so you guys hit on that i love that you brought this up this is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we ve read and you have to develop a theme so right there s a good start okay you ready for them to answer it yeah okay the pain that oedipus caused wasn t intentional so i don t really think he d be punished as harshly i do believe that he d be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and i believe a couple other people during that fight so he would be punished but i don t believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment cause really he didn t knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally so really he shouldn t be punished for something that he didn t know he was doing but he still killed somebody he did kill somebody and the gouging of his eyes i don t think would lessen that i think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him although it did cause him a lot of pain i believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes may i clarify something really quick here so you re saying basically because she asked where in hell would he be so f irst of all what level do you think he d be gouging eyes or not where would he be in hell where would dante run into him he would be with the murderers with the murderers okay so you re saying that he wouldn t be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging no that is just his own retribution yeah he did that to lessen the guilt in his life in himself cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes and also even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with like suicides right cause there s the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell or they destroy their possessions i didn t quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had i don t know maybe a couch or something if you destroyed that you d go to hell because they destroyed their own items right right in circle nine and that s what important about this in circle nine those people that destroyed or take from you know you have canna after cain everything is allegorical every part of circle nine there s an allegory there s ptolemy there s cain everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins because of what they did to humanity like ptolemy murdered people in his in his he was a ruler he just murdered people mass murders so he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin that hitler type of sin so everybody in that level too which would be interesting to see talk about some of our other literature talk about the odyssey a little more i have one more question about sin do you think is everyone s definition of sinning the same actually i don t believe so we were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in limbo goes along with what he said was no i didn t steal so you stole and then you lied yeah so you double dipped so you half and did different things oh interesting so what d you come to we came to they d go to the serious one yeah whichever one s more serious why basically the one thing that impacted the world more like in a bad way is going to take the worse punishment so if i stole a penny or i lied to the king i d probably get punished for lying to the king that s what we kind of came up with yeah so i want to ask you a question if you re saying you lied and then you lie about lying or you steal and you lie about lying i don t steal sorry yeah they re two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes okay so does that play into that would you suffer twice the punishment then no it doesn t bring up any of that in dante s basically everybody s got the same punishment but still wouldn t you get like harsher well depending on the circle yeah but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people will you give me an example well let s see ulysses and i forget the other guy s name they are in the same flame and i think he said the flame was burning brighter i would assume that d be a worse punishment than other people if they re burning if they re burning yeah some of the less worse um lesser punishments it s like magicians get their heads turned backwards you could see where you ve been but you wouldn t cry over it unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again yeah then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again yeah yeah i want to ask you guys a question because we ve studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying oedipus and i don t know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together but there is what is her name antigone s brother s name that was dead polynices yeah polynices was it the one where she was like leaning over his body yeah by the rock yeah okay now that you ve read the inferno do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur i can relate okay talk to me about that because it reminds me of dante being lost in the forest in the beginning and then it reminds me of how oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn t see anything and so he didn t know which path to take he had to rely on somebody else he had to rely on virgil to get him through what was to come then oedipus he had to rely on antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically nice nice that s what i got well as i walk away i want you guys cause i m going to leave this here i want you guys to talk about other literature cause you said yes i can relate some you just did i would like for you to relate all right okay okay,1.0

sister and you share animals alright lily may i show your friends what you and eulet did look look at their colors when you take turns look you make a pattern you go purple yellow purple yellow because you re taking turns the colors change each time that s called a pattern yeah alright so it s the purple turn now eulet that means it s your turn nice working together i m going to give brianna blue and natalie red okay here you go let s see if you guys can take turns oh and look alex gets blue and surafel what color do you get blue orange oh orange let s see here alright remember uh oh lily s turn look brianna look brianna this was your turn now tell natalie say natalie your turn surafel did you get one on you did so now who s turn umm remember we re taking turns say alex give him this part say put yours on alright here we re gonna leave this on wait for alex oh good now it s your turn brianna you have to talk to your friend and tell them when it s their turn nice job eulet and natalie brianna whoops you re pulling it the wrong way pull it this way so it goes on okay now who s turn my turn who s turn my turn brianna look natalie said it s her turn give it to natalie tell her your turn and then your turn is next how are we doin guys uh oh did they come off let me see let s see oh uh oh here let me come around and see if i can help you eulet and lily you re working so nicely is it your turn again alright natalie tell brianna when it s her turn alright boys let s see let s get you going again alright here let s put these down okay alex has blue and surafel has orange surafel can you put yours on okay beautiful okay now who s turn is it now now it s my turn who s turn do you remember me saying it s alex alex alex okay give it to alex here alex you re going to hold this part and you put your bead on whoops what s here oh it s a little bit tangled let me see if i can untangle it okay that s right now we need a red bead surafel can you sit down now it looked like you almost fell alright alex yours is on look we have orange and blue so now what do you do my turn oh is that right surafel s turn oh you guys are great seven i have seven beads you have seven beads i ll count how many beads i have one two three four five very good six seven oh good you have seven too you have the same number okay now what are we gonna do it was my turn okay who s turn is it alex okay good take this give it to alex and tell him it s give him this part and say alex it s your turn now his turn oh very nice now we can count one two one two three four five six uh oh the watch has to uh oh yours is brianna you put on a blue one okay now what happens brianna three four five okay hold on brianna six seven eight okay take it no wait a minute you had a turn can you give it now to natalie give it to natalie six i ve got six look give this to natalie and tell her it s your turn now natalie wow we are doing some nice work did you give it back to surafel for his turn alex yay alright there s an orange one surafel what are you going to do now this is of it all what do you do now alex pretty yay tell him alex your turn uh oh did we have a bead get away uh oh uh oh this bead doesn t want to go on the string it s five i have five i like the way you re taking turns okay you are almost finished eulet you re working so nicely with friends and the red has okay one two three four five six uh oh seven eight nine ten that s okay how did that happen we ve got two blue ones on there whoops that s okay now surafel is having his turn look what i m making oh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten are you finished yes okay show me what are you going to do now four five six oh you did some counting good i did okay and you have finished your turn so what do you do now you only have two left one two is it your turn nah okay so what do you say you say alex alex your turn okay friends we re almost done let me see uh oh we need a red one you know what i m going to make it so that you have the same number as your friend okay your turn let s see my turn here we go and you have the same number okay eulet can you talk to your partner your turn what are you going to say oh okay she said it s your turn can you say thank you thank you okay and we are almost finished uh oh we re doing some different turn taking here but that s okay alright okay so now who s turn is it alex okay give it to alex say alex your turn your turn three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen okay we re not counting so much right now we re taking turns who s turn is it now my turn natalie s turn okay so you tell her it s lily s turn i m next that s right tell her this is lily lily s turn look what happened did you finish yeah did you string all your beads yeah you did all of your beads are on your string let s look oh and you too nice job look you did orange and blue orange and blue orange and lots of blue orange and blue orange and blue beautiful okay i m gonna lay it right here let s look at yours because you finished and you used all of your beads oh look you used different colors you did blue can you say it with me red blue red blue red azul rojo azul rojo can you say that brianna azul rojo azul rojo azul you guys did a great job of taking turns we finished we finished you finished look you used all of your beads your trays are empty let s hold it up and look at the colors and the pattern you made can you tell me the pattern purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow yay and we know that you took turns because the colors changed every time it s clean up time you guys did a great job and you re right it is we are finished we learned how to take turns with a partner and we put beads on a string and made a color pattern because we took turns yes it was all good and i think you all get to ring the good job bell good job taking turns eulet good job taking,1.0
and i m going to look at what number that is and i see that that is now your information that you get we re going to be writing in our chart here so do you see at the bottom of your page it has ramp with one book you re going to write the distance that your car moved now don t write 20 inches cause yours is going to be different okay you write how far your car went for ramp number one okay hold on just a second isabelle now i gave you guys numbers and the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment the number one person is going to set up the ramp so they re going to put the dictionary and the ramp get it all set up for the group the number two person is going to get to hold the car and let it go okay and then the number three person is going to measure the distance that it went okay close attention okay so you re going to all have a job to do now this is with the one dictionary when we do the experiment next we re going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes okay but for right now we re going to try just one dictionary are there any questions before we get started miguel like the first one goes first and then on the second thing like you try to set the number one does the second job and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job yes so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment okay so we don t need to fight over who gets to do the car and who can get that okay isabelle question but what if we do the same each of us what we do oh if that s what you get if you get 20 inches on yours then you write that down okay yes angie when you took no we re all going to talk to each other in nice friendly voices that s right okay max last question and then we need to get started are we going to use the rulers yes you re going to use the rulers and i know i didn t give those to the groups but i m going to pass those out right now okay can i have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group who s going to set up the ramp me okay you re number two start it in the corner it s a meter come on over here okay get your paper no but watch out don t do it awesome okay boys and girls once you get to your group you can go ahead and get started it looks farther and this group you may use this ruler okay measure it one right here and then here are you okay no from here from there there no ms sprano said from here nine inches no 11 11 11 inches it looks like eight wait is oh no it s eight remember what ms sprano said no she said from the front actually i said from the back good listening miguel so how far did the car go eight inches eight inches okay excellent so write down your information you ve got a pencil right here okay so the next step isabelle miguel and angie is you re going to try it with two dictionaries okay but number three is going to set it up look up at the chart to see who s going to set it up so who s setting it up um number two okay let s figure it out okay now go to your group for a second okay now is this how far going to yea till we go well wait a second are we measuring from the top of the ramp or are we measuring from the bottom so you re going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp and then measure to the end of the car so how far did that car go five no it s to the end of the car so how far did the car go two two inches now do you guys think that because you re on a thicker carpet that s going to change your results it should go up like that do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far yes yeah would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet yeah okay you can move to that carpet and see what the difference is and you guys will have to share that with the class okay so try it again with just one dictionary okay so then one have to let the car go guys we re going to try it with two dictionaries okay so look at the chart to see who s going to set it up next oh my god this is going to be loud we re good ms sprano she said from the very back you set it up no i mean you let go who s turn is it you re doing the first one who s number three we all have jobs to do who s number one okay so your job is to set up the ramp which you did a good job on number two person who s the number two person so giselle i m number three no she was two it s fine she s number three so giselle you re going to let the car go and look esmeralda is going to measure okay so excellent okay now put that down now which side do we need to start with very good and then we can spin it around there so now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet can you scoot it over some very good so how far did the car go seven inches good okay so let s write that down on our chart finish yours change this so it s seven inches okay now what s our next step what are we going to do next i don t know are we going to try it with two dictionaries okay so now who s going to set that up looks like the number two person so giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary so put one more dictionary on top okay good well number three is going to let the car go so now it s esmeralda s turn so you guys what do you think is going to happen do you think it s going to go farther or do you think it s going to be closer when you let go of the car right now what do you think is going to happen you think it ll fall down okay well let s see what happens woah did you see how far that went okay don t pick it now wait a second it s edgar s turn to measure so let s see how far did it go edgar so we measure to the 14 wow that went farther didn t it so your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries please go sit down in your group and raise your hand let s go sit down at our group the car s there 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half who knows how to write 15 and a half so number two would get to measure the distance on this one okay okay so let me see how you re doing here okay well can we try it again can we try it again so you re on the second experiment so number three who s the number three person he is jose s the number three person okay so jose get s to let it go should we move this out of the way or should we keep it here so are you number three no i m number one but number one set it up but then see oh okay so it looks like it s jose s turn to let the car go so hand the car no he sets up ramp can you go sit down please and i ll be right with you got it okay jose try it it s my car put it right here and let s see what happens okay let go excellent okay who s measuring me okay so let s measure now do we want it are we measuring with inches or centimeters no it s right we re doing it the right way don t worry did it go farther or was it closer okay so then i have a question for you guys listen if we put three dictionaries here do you think it s going to go farther or it s going to go closer farther you think it s going to be farther what do you think jose farther what do you think farther well okay we better check it out did you write down your numbers so for the second one it was 15 inches okay now we re on the last part that means the number three person sets up the ramp are you the number three person so set up the ramp where s your other dictionary okay so then we have to use the dictionary okay can you let go okay it s oh wow that might be pretty cool huh okay so devon it s your turn to let the car go and i like how you re moving all the stuff out of the way selena you want to stay there or do you want to move oh okay so who s turn is it to measure again no number one gets to you know what i think we mixed it up now selena lets go of the car and devon measures this time okay did you okay so maybe it s jose s turn okay go ahead ooh look how much it turned okay so measure how far it went okay so measure how far it went let s see what happened do we move the 17 try it again let s try it again okay let s see how are you guys doing you got all yours finished okay good okay well i haven t gone over that okay boys and girls raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments all three okay,1.0
isn t it nuclear fission when like fusion no fusion is when they combine nuclear fission is like when they split apart right yes so it s a fission process see ah so that s a i see that that efficient efficient it increases the safety though right it s impossible to explain no i m just saying does it no i don t understand am i the only one here apparently to you though so why is it that when the atom is unstable it s radioactive it could be it s removing protons and neutrons i think you guys can discuss this isn t it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom or something and then it gains the neutron and that s when it starts becoming like more vulnerable more vulnerable and it starts like a chain reaction you guys agree i agree i agree i agree with everybody that s right so how can radiation help them like amy said it could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources like you said what else though like cancer cancer cancer i mean i had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away it kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication any last thoughts okay that s fine thank you i have only one major i guess comment about that one i noticed steve used a lot of vocabulary words he did remember a lot of the words and i think he planned for that and then i liked the way that david actually redirected the group he asked the group how can radiation help us right at the end and then people responded to that so he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group so and then people were able to respond so that was a nice way to create a discussion okay question number two three three i m sorry okay i mean how about number four next okay i m going to do number four next no do number three the one with three no i m going to do four no i want to do three okay number four is going to go next you have two minutes to prepare number four just ignore it what is that a microphone oh it works so they can hear me right now oh it s recording well why do you think president obama might support building nuclear power plants in the usa and what are some arguments for nuclear energy david put that away okay jane who s going to go next me jane okay so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on nuclear power plant nuclear power plant well pick several the nuclear yeah the nuclear power plant can help us create more energy i mean well it s nuclear radiation for my argument you know what dano was saying no he was just going to put power plants do you know what it is yeah it s where they yeah okay what does it do creates energy okay okay what other evidence are you going to use though the fact that we are running out of well we re not running out of but in the future we might not be able to find enough energy so we need to start we need to start thinking about the future like jobs and stuff no future things that are like the future and what s going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply like what if we were running out and start thinking about that okay so the next person okay so the people on the outside if you were recording the vocabulary last time i want the people on the outside to switch so that you re recording something different so if you did evidence first switch to vocabulary if you did vocabulary switch to evidence oh sindi sit like right here okay this question is why do you think president obama might support building nuclear power plants in the u s and based on the video we watched what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy i think president obama might support building nuclear power plants in the u s because it doesn t release chemicals therefore it s eco friendly making the u s more green environmentally green i agree with her because another reason i think the president might support it is because like like right now we re in an economic crisis what you call the thing and then like making new plants may create more jobs for people it ll create jobs for building them and then it ll also benefit everybody for clean power i agree i agree because it builds economic stabilization and it ll create jobs for the future like for more years because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need you know like to build it and once it s built you still need to work with it so i think the job s going to last for a while i agree but if we re in an economic crisis like if we re in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it like where s the money going to come from well we re already in debt so we ll get even more debt yeah it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor we d get funding yeah and we have to like think about the future and how it s going to benefit you know for the economy and making more power plants would just provide like a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff and more you know we ll get more electricity you know if we build more nuclear power plants yeah and not just 20 but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that needs luxuries rising electricity demands it won t leave the u s behind and all the new tech stuff and the more factories and the more power plants we produce we make the more electricity and the more factories it will get more stuff it will build the more jobs and that will raise up the economic problems yeah because more stuff will be done that way so now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy what do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of the thing that causes cancer probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off well they don t give it off the water the coolant or whatever and then like they don t have nowhere to store it i think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build but they didn t build they re going to run out of space to put the waste in also it s going to cause cancer to everyone but doesn t it cure cancer and stuff it has benefits but more like some freak accident can happen like what happened in fukushima or the third mile at the three mile yeah so say you never know what can happen that s the downside because if it does happen then it s like downhill from there because people start getting sick then their kids start dying and i don t know yeah and like giovanni said if we are in an economic crisis like where are we going to get the rest of the money we re just going to get it from debt and stuff like that we re going to help raise it up but we ll also fall more in debt yeah going back to the nuclear waste can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem because it s just there kevin i think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution that s what i think cause more what it causes more war and pollution war well i mean this isn t on camera right okay someone else wait what was the question again elaborate on what is nuclear waste nuclear waste why is that such a problem for us well it s a problem because there s nowhere where you could actually safely put it other than like i think they have this i read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes that s the only place that you can like get rid of it don t throw it in the ocean because it ll contaminate everything you can t just like leave it in the ground because then it ll probably like leak and also doesn t it if it rains if water gets in it it s dangerous so that s why they have to find a place where it s not like why is it dangerous if water gets into it soil i guess the waste and the water mix and then like it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it ll mess up the ocean or like water and we end up drinking it and scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste like they re thinking of shooting it out into space or anything one thing nobody talked about was half life what does the half life have to do with nuclear waste i think a bunch of years what does it have to do with obama say it louder what say it louder we re talking about that noise wait what was your question what does half life have to do with nuclear waste half life nuclear waste so energy so why is nuclear waste bad exactly oh because they haven t determined the amount of years of when the half life is i think they determined like so they so it was an estimate it wasn t actually a fact they just estimated that so it could be before so they wouldn t be able to prevent to prevent it from affecting society oh good so let s just get this done let s try the next group okay thank you i know bryan i don t need to look it up i know this already okay do you guys want to break before you go up okay you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself so it s not a shock okay question number three let s come up people seem anxious let s do this okay no phone diana we re missing people yeah we are okay so people on the outside you guys should switch so if you did evidence you know so what you did one time evidence looking for evidence and one time you re looking for vocabulary okay so people on the outside make sure you re checking different parts okay so what i might change the question you guys what it happens okay number three what recommendations would you make to president obama regarding clean energy and climate change so for example they re trying to build two nuclear power plants in georgia so what recommendations will you make to him about building in georgia building in jorj ee uh georgia the state um i think he should make sure that employees aren t making careless mistakes such as the human error in the three mile island i think that he should promote programs on alternative energy but not just nuclear energy but he could also use nuclear energy because it could because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20 of our energy already comes from nuclear energy so we could just get more energy through nuclear power i think we shouldn t use it because of it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer okay nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates nuclear power plants create toxic waste i would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it s most struggling recommendations i would make to obama regarding nuclear energy is that to stop because it s too dangerous to handle and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists they can use it to murder to murder me or destroy countries we can t prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants then the nuclear radiation which is unstable can harm by radioactivity and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit fukushima and this means that it can happen to anyone even us that s what i wrote i think it could be a good idea but i think they should focus more on how it could harm people to try and control the harmfulness so it won t harm people yeah i think it s a good idea i think my recommendation for obama is that it is not good to nuclear because it s going to affect us it s going to affect our pollution and he s going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn t do that yeah i agree with charlie too we don t know what nuclear energy could also like harm us which ways or i mean we do but i mean it s better like we could just focus on studying more like having more thoughts like ask him what s better it s like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we re using now so i have to change one question based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read what argument has influenced you the most the fukushima argument so go ahead and explain it to the group though because um things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us like human error and i think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage the area which is nobody can go because it s radioactive and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like i don t know thousands of years just for the half life and we won t be able to use that space anymore it kills everything people got cancer,1.0
we haven t talked about some things that we do when we are what sad sad not sad he s ma mad mad he is really really mad he s got that mad face going rrrr he is so ugly he is so ugly he is mad and it says sometimes i get mad is it okay if we re mad yeah yeah what is no if somebody eat people i bet that way too that must have been ow ow ow if someone s biting they probably would get in trouble

alright this page you don t got a sister yes he has a sister this says i do when i get mad sometimes i i hit i throw those toys throw our toys i bite somebody i may bite or i may yell yell are those good things to do no why not someone might cry in trouble because nick said some might cry maybe it would hurt them and get in trouble they would but we don t want to hurt our friends do we and pull our hair or if someone yeah we don t want to pull our friends hair either cause the would hurt our friends or pull somebody s braids or pull somebodies braids that would hurt and that is not a good not a is it my uncle had braids did he i do this said this is not a good idea that is a those are what those green choices or red choices red choices those are red choices things we do not want to do alright let s see what our next page says it says when i am mad it is a good idea too who remembers something that we can do who remembers something we can do when we re mad that s okay to do i know i know what if somebody get mad then what can you do kick somebody and punch somebody in the face is that a green choice or a red choice red choice punching someone would be a red choice what s a green choice we could make do you remember one yeah that be good what is a good choice that maybe share with toys maybe we could share our toys that would be a good choice here criss cross please i m by myself criss cross please kendrel said maybe we can share our toys yeah alright last time we talked about some other things we can do what talk to some buddies talk to our friends good nick and what do we tell our friends um if they took a toy from us what could we tell them sorry sorry no not sorry if we took a toy from our friends we could tell them sorry but if they took a toy from you and you

a little bit alright i have some of our pancakes yeah yay pancakes the pancake game alright yeah pancake games and on some of my pancakes are things that are coo coo games red choices things that we don t want to do when we re mad and some of my things are green choices and if it s a green choice we re gonna add it to our book if it s a red choice we re gonna put it on our plate okay alright so jakiah you want to go first yes alright are you ready alright here you go ma am i want the pink one flip it oh that went way high past my head what is that boy doing not your thing what is he doing

do we need to be good so jakiah does that go on our red choice plate or is that a green choice that goes in our book it s the red choice it is a red choice plate you are right all of our red choices go on our plate you were right that was a red choice put is right on top nice thank you high five good job scoot back sit down alright nicholas are you ready flip that thing i caught it what are they doing on there they are smelling that flower and blowing out the candle can you show me how to do that smell your flowers now put the hand on top do it one more time for me sometimes we need to stop and take a deep breath to calm ourselves down nick is that a red choice or a green choice green choice it absolutely is a green choice here s your sticky stuff i m gonna put it right there can you stick that picture right on top please our sticky tack sticky tack put it on top please sticky tack sticky tack good job sticky tack nice thinking okay high five okay high five nice work have a seat alright kendrel lowel are you ready yeah what about this one woah woah somebody push somebody off the chair somebody pushed someone else off that chair somebody broke that head off right there it doesn t look like he has a neck does it you re right woah that s just weird try and see me criss cross applesauce jakiah show me criss cross please thank you alright kendrel is that a green choice or a red choice red choice absolutely why is that a red choice because that is very bad don t know when to snack or probably our friends at the playground why is that a red choice because they gonna get left because it hurts their friends friends it hurts their friends that pushed somebody off the chair yep alright jakiah jakiah kendrel where does that one go on the red on the red choice plate you re absolutely right alright miss jakiah flip that pancake boom what is he doing numbers numbers they are one two three and what are they doing they re counting can you help me count to ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten if we get really mad at our friends can we stop what we re doing take a deep breath and count to ten to help calm ourselves down yes would that be a green choice or a red choice green choice absolutely it is a green choice jakiah is that a green choice or a red choice red choice a red choice is it a red choice to count no does that hurt our friends if we stop and count no teacher so that s a green choice something we can add to our book though it s the red choice that s a green choice we can stop and count our red choices are that s a green things that may hurt ourselves choice and a green or our friends choice it is a green choice can you put it right there on our sticky tack in our book sticky tack put the picture on top please i know sticky s cake alright you ready mr nick yeah sticky okay let s do one more lets see what else you re sticky we can do we could can we do this one oh what are they doing walking walking they re taking a walk if we get really mad and we just need to get away from our friends for a minute is it okay if you come ask me to take a walk yeah yep we could walk around the hallways so is that a green choice or a red choice green choice it absolutely is there s your sticky stuff sticky stuff your sticky tack sticky tack it make stick put it on quick please or on the book please good job let me see okay stick it on there nice job alright so let s look at some of the things that we have that we can do can you scoot way over here so your friends can see alright you guys help me read this if we get mad it s a good idea to talk to people talk to our friends we can tell our friends to give it back to give it back or to give us back the toys or to stop stop we can talk to who jakiah who else can we talk to our teacher our teacher and what can we tell our teachers to give us back our toys we could say someone took my toy and they will not give it back or someone hit me give it back teachers alright we could stop and do what that guy what can we do good kendrel this one this guy what could we do nick smell that flower and then blow that candle away we can stop and take a deep breath smell that flower blow out that candle deep breath smell that flower we could push the hands push those hands how hard can you squeeze them jakiah can you show me nick s squeezing kendrel s squeezing alright we could ask our teachers to what they get a walk to take a walk sometimes we may just need to to get out of our classroom and that is okay you re loud that was loud you re right you screamed but you know what i like how you used your words and told him you told him that you were screaming and that hurt my ears alright using your words i did you did too alright what s our last one we can one two numbers we can stop and count count we count to ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it makes my teachers happy when i am calm and not mad,1.0
okay let s get busy so before we change the car we have two more times okay let s look jacob let s help it s 9 3 what is 9 three 93 93 is there a way that we can maybe change to other things here to make it go further like the car yeah how maybe the height how about you guys discuss oh try it put that way back like that it might need help for you holding the ramp how bout you do you think that s a good idea i m gonna roll it back alright oh is it gonna stay you think yeah i bet awesome let s see how far it went watch your foot 105 what is 105 105 i love the way that you re making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in so let s take a look jacob let s look over here let s look at our data we have the roll one with just the normal way we had 101 inches and then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches and roll three at 105 inches which way went the furthest 103 roll three roll three why do you think that is because it s 101 that one is 101 and that ones 105 well why do you think roll one is different from roll three because ones higher then the other higher then the other because ones higher then the other okay so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle i think we should what do you think we should pick take away the girl take away the girl nothing what do you guys think about hailey s idea what did she say jacob s hold on what did hailey say say it again we shouldn t even try okay okay so how about jacob since jacob was trying to make the other car how bout jacob tries to put on bigger wheels we should see what happens then here jacob well look at this look at which one would we need bigger wheels on that one that one okay so that car go farther that one will go farther probably will go farther you think with bigger wheels yeah cause the bigger the wheel the easier it has balance did you hear what he said bigger wheels have balance the bigger the wheels the more balanced it is i m saying like let s say you re is that gonna work is there anything else you guys want to do to this car or do you just want to change one thing i just change one thing okay it s your car so what about your ramp ashley what about your ramp how do you want your ramp to be maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way okay 76 you want to try that way alright that s true whoa that wasn t go far alright let s measure it goes a little bit she needs a little bit of help 72 72 we re gonna put this vehicle alright so we re not going to change the car but what could we do 32 whoa look student guys this is going to be affecting weight okay that box could stay here instead of alright you guys try it you guys got it now 91 times 2 well that s up to your group can i make my car now no not yet that s not weight three yet split weight right now so how you guys doing did you guys try to move the weight in different ways ok alright back let s do it together 56 look at that let s see what happened no it s 67 where s your data at put the data over here so we re all in the same place 83 okay let s take a look what do you have here 67 this will be so much fun okay you roll it ashley can i work on it can i have it should we take something away first no no 42 i think we should put a little one gimme that you think we should i m not sure cause the blue one wow cool oh oh my gosh here i ll yeah and without these wheels now are you ready go here here we go ouchie hold the end i ll hold it 77 no it s 67 jacob 67 might be 77 what is 77 we did it for two ways so they can do it last way that was way more yeah but how many inches was that second roll look three feet so 3 f so what three feet equals 36 inches we re going to be focused on the inches so we don t get confused so hold on wait a second when we had that ramp the first way what did you do with it the same way as the first way no we did this way just that yeah we haven t done it like that i know just re adjust this yeah so when did it go when you did just that 30 seconds no it went that what is that 73 73 so then we moved it to make it which way did we do it the second way higher we did it this way what happened to the numbers it went lower it went lower so if we go it lower it goes higher i don t know let s try so what s another ramp that we can make have you tried that way before nope alright let s see hold on a second david we have to measure nope your group can help you measure let s see 35 ooh that s seven okay let s take a look again let s make sure what s that there we go so roll three let s try now let s take a look at our data hold on that s not gonna work you don t think so well let s first take a look here and then we can see if that will work it s probably gonna fall what happened with roll three where s the data look at roll three what is it 35 and what s roll two i don t know 36 so what do you think happened whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher i mean a little bit lower i m sorry it changed it changed what happened when it changed the number i see let s focus it goes more faster it might go more faster there s not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp and you guys wanna try that yeah okay let s see let s see what happens taylor what happened it fell i knew it would my box well how about you hold that so we can try it again try it again oh no fix em and let s see if it does that every time do you think it ll do it every time yes yes let s try again i ll measure this time you ll measure yeah oh oh we have to do it again taylor you can go on the carpet this time i made it lower oh so he just said something what did he say he made it lower he made it lower so what s happening every time he makes it a little bit lower it falls off when it falls off it still can roll i mean just keep it rolling when it falls off uh oh i ll measure it okay we don t have enough space to measure that one how about we change the car and try again but what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed what happened when it was super high it fell apart it didn t work so well can you imagine if you were in a real car and you were going down something that steep yeah no that would be kinda scary wouldn t it but as it kept going down what happened it didn t go off it didn t fall apart you re right alright go back and try to make a different car okay go back and try to make it be careful your gonna make me nervous alright let s see jacob what do you have come on over nope jacob come on over what in the world did you make that looks like a mack truck girls do you see this yeah tractors throwing in something now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you big girls are you watching look at how that rolled girls you next okay this was all my idea that was your idea i love it could we try it this way we could keep a hold of that you might want to try it let s see well we should be working on correctamundo see i got a good review what do we got jacob 93 93 so what can we do to change it i guess we could maybe we re learning something we are learning something what did we learning we learned the car the littler it is the harder for it to fall that is true it s your turn is that what you re finding out the smaller the car yeah the smaller the car the more it picks up picks up cars go over oh were we going over no i it s your turn preston oh did you guys hear him let s take a second and listen he was talking about yesterday s experiment what did we do yesterday we tried rolling little cars on the carpet why didn t it work out so well jacob little cars on the carpet because the wheels stopped them why did they stop you think because the carpets too rough because the carpet s too rough did you guys find that too so what are you finding about today that the bigger the wheels the on hard surfaces it s faster on smoother and hard surfaces it goes further so what are you finding out about the ramp that you guys are finding that how about you decide that for this last one you tried one way with the ramp and now we re going to try two more ways with this ramp and i want to see if guys can figure out how this works better with a ramp,1.0
like a long a not long a long o no i ll give you a hint there s some letters up on the front what is the sound er it s er er everybody say er er okay what we re going to do if you remember last week we looked at some pictures and when you heard the er sound what sound did you make er no e r what did you make tweet tweet tweet tweet because a bird says tweet tweet and a bird has er so my first picture is a train do you hear it yes ma am no do you hear an er oh no no so are you going to say tweet tweet no no shirt tweet tweet girl tweet tweet bird tweet tweet rope no skirt tweet tweet purse tweet tweet shark tweet tweet do you hear er in shark no do you hear the difference what do you hear ar that s different okay let s look really quick eyes up here when i have the word skirt what two letters make er i r very good this is a nurse what two letters make er u r good tweet this is a fern what two letters say er e r very good we re going to read some words okay i want you to look at this word first connor look at the word everybody what word is that sir look at it think about it first what word fur four fur what s this word fur very good think about it first what word spur think about it first what word hurt think about it don t say it and what word is it spurt spurt very good think about it first what word nerve think about it what word serve think about it nurse what word nurse think about it purse what you re thinking i can t hear you think all right ready what word purse good think about it what word germ think about it don t say it yet what word term term eyes up here okay good now we re going to go to our work mats and we re going to build some words okay okay you can give the students a point because you all did a very good job everybody was paying attention and participating all right watch how miss dodd is doing this because you re going to do the same thing get your word mat out in front of you and put your letters out so you can see them we have to go kind of quick i m going to put this on top of this just for now okay thanks you re welcome all right let s see let s see how fast we can get those out let s see i m going to say we can do it in 40 seconds let me help you out let s put all these out so you can see them you have a lot of words shh okay we re not putting them down on the mat we re going to put them up here and then we re going to pull them down to the mat there we go economics shh all right let s see if we made it are we all done yes ma am all right give the students another point because you did it in enough time okay miss dodd has the words up here also the word parts so first let s look at the ending parts okay what do you think this says er er very good look at this next one what does this say urt urt eyes up here eyes up here good what does this say er good what does this say urse and what does this say erve okay these are the same cards that you have so we re going to make some words okay okay first we re going to start with urt u r t so let s pull that down to where it says rhyme u r t okay and i want you to make the word hurt hurt good job all right let s spell hurt together h u r t hurt very good all right so miss dodd will pull down my h and it looks like everybody got that okay now i want you to take your u r pull down your u r okay and this time i m going to give you a clue i want you to make the word that is something that is on an animal covers an animal keeps him warm his what we don t want our h right now let s see if you can figure it out you should have u r right here okay and now we re going to so what was the answer to my clue fur fur spell it f u r fur keep your u r and i want you to make the word spur spur we talked about this word last week a spur okay yes who put the things out i did okay who remembers what a spur is something that you kick very good here s a picture of a spur remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and it makes the horse go fast okay so i should pull down my s p and this word is spur very good all right i want you to pull down your u r s e u r s e and you shouldn t have anything in front of the u r s e you should just have it just like madison has it here she doesn t have anything for onset she only has her rhyme okay all right what does that part say urse urse okay i want you to add a p and see what word you get and if you have a d you might want to flip it over it s also a p okay all right what word is that purse purse very good okay i want you to take your i r and pull it down and this time i want you to make your own word with i r it might not be the same word your neighbor makes i want you to make your own word with i r look at all the onset parts that you have and see what you can add to ir good job all right let s look at what we came up with what did you come up with sir sir okay so i ll pull down my s here this word is sir that is correct and i see a few people have sir let s see let s look at this one what did you make spir but what two letters actually say ur in spur i r not i r remember u r yep let s put it up here so we remember it spur is s p u r i ve got another one all right dirt okay oh yeah how do you spell dirt oh yeah wait oh yeah we might not have that ending but do you know how to spell dirt d i r t very good all right let s move on to another one oh i see that you have g i r gir what were you thinking when you wrote that can you use that in a sentence no okay this one is not a word okay now we re going to pull out our e r v e e r v e let s see how quickly we can get it up you all are doing a good job you re all probably going to get another point e r v e okay and i want you to fill in the blank the ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food the ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food what can we put in front of the e r v e that would complete that sentence it s got to make sense all right what is this word erve let s see what if i were to put an s what word would i have serve serve does that make sense in my sentence do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food yeah so what word did we come up with serve serve very good okay so this is what i want you to do i want you to take all your cards just like miss dodd s doing here and i m just going to put them together pretty quick i don t have to really take my time here and then i m going to stick them on my page we re going to make a pile in the middle good job all right good and remember it doesn t have to be perfect good job and let s take it all is this yours good job no all right i m going to go ahead and hand you our story we re going to take what we ve learned and take it to text we re going to read a story that has lots of words that have the er sound this looks like i have one yeah that one s his curls that swirl all right i can t put it whoa it s got 12 pages okay all right let me go ahead and take those so we can go ahead and start reading okay okay you can give the students a point because you did a good job last time okay i m going to give everybody a highlighter because as we re reading i want you highlighting words that have the er sound okay so what s my title curls that swirl very good do you see some words that have the er sound yes ma am let s highlight them what s my first word curls u r curls what s my next word that has er swirl swirl very good all right curls that swirl what are they talking about about curls what kind of curls are they talking about like curls in your hair curls in your hair very good okay as we re going i m going to be putting the words up here okay so we have curls and we have swirl and we will use these words again tomorrow okay so let s open up to the first page miss dodd miss dodd highlight it again no highlighting yet okay cheryl oh okay well come up no no we re on this page here page three at the bottom okay okay okay so let s see how quickly we can get to page three all right what we re going to do is i want you following along miss dodd s going to model how we re going to read this page as i m reading you can highlight when i say an er word does everybody understand the directions yes ma am okay but you need to be listening because after this we re going to read it all together okay here we go once there was a small girl who had hair that curled and swirled and twirled drop where you hand is i messed up that s okay we ll go back and look at it this one we ll talk about it it swirled over her shirt and way past her skirt okay now stop no no we re going to just look at that one page because i see some things that make me ask some questions what word did you ask me about that wasn t me did you ask me about a word what word there there okay let s look at the word there okay now should we highlight there yes ma am raise your hand if you say yes we should raise your hand if you say no we shouldn t okay well let s look at it does it have e r like we re looking for yes it does but does it say er no no it has a different sound every e r isn t going to say er it s just going to be special times so in this case should we highlight it no no okay and it s okay if you did okay all right let s go ahead and read it together now everybody follow along let s put our finger under the first word or your highlighter is fine,1.0
negative x minus it it s one over oh wait oh wait wait wait wait how do we solve for x x is the value of r anyway x is the value of r what would you do for the one over x wouldn t that be the first term x is the value of r what i would suggest you do is is that you could rewrite this as an expression oh as the power oh oh okay okay i used oh yeah yeah all right yeah i got it so it s gonna be negative x minus one okay okay no i got it so the first it s gonna be so what whatever oh come on i just wanted to find where it talks about it would be one minus one oh we have one is one over x the sum do you see see what i m saying yeah i m gonna put it in there so negative x minus one cause later it s gonna change wait you don t really have to do it out since it s gonna change the so it s higher you ll have to you gotta yeah no no no no no don t don t don t don t don t even do that do you know why because it s part of a well yeah yeah yeah cause the whole thing is negative and then that s the remember the he s a natural but now here s the question you guys kind of already answered this question could you have found it they give you basically r is two x uh huh and since it converges it has to be less than the absolute value of you got it okay that makes sense go back for a second yeah you multiply both sides by a third so it d be one third times every single one of em and the interval um oh maybe someone s it means it s gonna get shifted and then you were just scaling the because it s like i d never i never considered oh okay yeah it s not gonna change the domain of the oh no no i m putting plus negative the answer yeah so the only thing i m thinking is it might be easier for you to just it might make sense somehow oh how do you read yeah how do you no no no no no no no no it doesn t reduce the time it takes for it to no man right oh okay yeah one third oh i get it i get it it only converges as you no matter what well no matter what one over x three x five x two in two over x i think it does thank you you re welcome that s what i m yeah that s what i m saying one over x because what they want you to do now so you d say power series is gonna be written as a form of say geometric series because now you ve got what what s the first term yeah right okay what s the ratio negative and when you write that out put around it let him once show him okay is it saying three x i would be i would take the are you sure you re working together yes and i ll turn it one we got one minus x squared one over one plus x squared that s x to the fourth right minus x to the sixth plus x to the eighth this is if you are indexing this this is your first term this is your second term this is your third term right think about the first one okay we have left that in order to get that a two x like the first r okay the first side of it and say it s the second term that the first time so it s probably gonna probably gonna be it probably okay at least on these simple ones okay okay leave that for okay n minus one over one minus one x minus one would be zero which would be originally we have negative one x minus one the right one so it s either gonna be now you re expanding by three instead of zero six so it s like negative x squared switched so the negative that goes over here is negative x squared too so the negative is which y i don t uh i don t know what i m doing all right look hold on isn t it the same as the third one that means that the y like the same one y is the common one right to the one so this would be x minus one and negative just put in one here four all right what s the ratio here one you re multiplying the outside of two x another one you re doing it as the two x that means you re moving the x to the inside if you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple if you take arcsine of x any function you want and you multiply it by scale like one third one fourth ah but then there we said no oh my god what arc what are you wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on there s gonna be another one i haven t there and one third after that is what we re doing here our r remains the same it s the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third okay yeah i m agreeing to that i m pretty sure that s right you multiply this out it s gonna be one over three plus three x minus one why are you multiplying it out just think of it as a scale it s not anything to do it s not gonna affect our domain outside the function it s only gonna affect the range and therefore you re not gonna have any remains cause the remains only matter if you didn t have but like one third of it so we re not doing it like that one third after it we re doing like a stretched version so it s not gonna affect the equation so it s negative x what no no no no no no that s the series for uh all right i m just negative x squared right no no no i m putting negative x squared it s easier cause then later on when you do plus no no no no no i the sine s been switching no no yeah but you can represent that by saying yeah it s gonna be smaller well it ll be switching but like would you represent how would you represent x in the whole thing to the negative see the n minus one is put that s how i m doing it wait how would you find the if it s the absolute value of x minus one it would be less than one mrs dockin yes is this is this is this x we re not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change what is x over r take this series right here which is that so then integrate it we just though you integrate every term to get it now you re looking for a general expression right you have a general expression it didn t tell you to come up with no they didn t tell you to do that oh okay okay okay because in fact that s not a power series that s not a power series it is okay but it s a different form of a power series so you don t have to write em like this because you would also need to have what you also have to have right yeah okay got it okay you flip it around one good yeah good what s r the negative of yeah you re the negative x plus one but it needs to be in parentheses so now you need your r okay now you re gonna do them when you get to it needs to be a form of k over r oh i thought we just solve for r you said the third nominated was r all right guys she said 1 3 times one whatever that is how do you multiply these does it need to be on the yeah so you do it again yeah multiply the whole interval yeah multiply the interval and this is not in the form of a series that one third does that impact the greatness of one that s the question you want to answer i m not answering it for you right now you need to figure it out so when it s asking for does the function of the this it s like that you didn t divide it by seven,1.0
you re totally fine so you guys will be using i m assuming a meter tape yeah for measurements and then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we re good strength versus strength qualifies ten times ok so i like that you re making everyone go clockwise everyone s doing ten alright and then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot ok there s a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on no shoes on ok perfect you guys are good ok so wingspan what are your units you guys are measuring in centimeters and you re going tip to tip right and then what was the ability again they ll take their shoes off try to touch their toes and then we ll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot ok good in what units centimeters centimeters did you say take shoes off or no yeah ok cool you guys can start collecting data i ll come back to you ok what do you guys got same thing we got yesterday recap me hair color you were hair color why the hell don t you have something else i don t know ok so here s my question cause i was thinking about this last night you re gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data how would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color ok so you re gonna assign numbers numeric data to shades zero to ten or one to ten one to ten yeah one being the lightest the lightest lightest we should probably get this straightened out before we do it right and then ten being the darkest ok before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm draw a line out so i could see where you re getting your number data and then what is your characteristic that was your characteristic what is your ability how many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet ok so we ll probably do that in the hallway does that sound fine meter tapes are up there that s a lot of guys so give me a real quick scale then you guys can start ok one and ten so that s blonde and really blonde and like really dark brown so where would red fall in like me like right there so you re gonna make blonde one end the low end are we all in agreeance on that yeah and mine is like in the middle ok and then the other far end s gonna be the darkest brown yeah or black or black are you gonna have everyone taking data on that or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color you know what i mean so there s not a ton of variation measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger and then hopping on one foot right on your tiptoe or no balance balance and then once your heel touch into the ground it s done and your hands can do whatever you want ok are we shoe on shoe off shoe off shoe off and is it right or left foot right foot for everybody ok right foot shoe off on tiptoe max two minutes max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground or their other foot or their other foot so it could be either or okeydoke so just a kind of a flashback to remind us this has been a couple daytime span here our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil so as we work through this unit we re gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past we ve been specifically as i ve said before looking at one specific fossil foot fossil length right the idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together we start to get a clear image of what s going on again our goal was to determine if there s a relationship between the characteristic you chose the ability you chose and a person s foot fossil i asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit that could be an indirect relationship a direct one a trend or no relationship what i m gonna ask you to do for a minute talk to your neighbors compare your data make sure we re on the same page in determining a relationship and then i d like you to come up and post your data it s gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data so for example if group one what was your characteristic for fossil length hand spans we re gonna put characteristic on the left side so they re gonna right hand span for us and then what type of relationship did you guys see for that direct direct so all you re gonna do is do this that s all we need to report ok in your lab packet you are going to find some little graphs you re gonna be asked to record everyone s data i ve also given you a supplementary sheet cause you re gonna need more graphs i messed up and didn t tell you so what s gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here you will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you ll be looking at everyone s data and drawing conclusions ok so take a minute to talk to your groups i ll come around and give you some markers determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are post them on the board and then we ll talk no can you determine it no cause they re not they re just kind of clustered it was like more not clustered ok so we re gonna have a trend fall in between where i guess the trend really is between 15 and what are we lacking you know what it was 12 30 last night fossil foot length stride length ok so we re having a trend falling between what s our lowest our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones ok i think that works so you re gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there need help ok whatcha got would you draw a line for a trend yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning so this person s kinda like an outlier right so let s just for argument s sake take them out does that help clear the data up at all you could say no it s ok they re all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times ok so we ve got a pretty wide range here right for trend we tend to see more of a skinnier range so if you look at our options it s definitely not a direct or indirect i would say based on what you showed me right trend wise it s kind of a wide range so what would we determine what s our other option no relationship yeah i would probably go so up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation ok here s your marker with this one cause it s kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area but then there s also the increase ok so here s my question that s a good question when i look at this data right if i had a pick excluding this line if i had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall where would you pick up here why yeah it appears to be going this way so that would indicate that you have a direct relationship it s kind of the easiest way to look at it ok group number one hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height what kind of relationship are we seeing here direct so the bigger the foot fossil the bigger the hand span so just to clarify hand span we re talking tip of thumb to tip of finger correct why do we see that so i asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section so you might want to turn to that page everyone cause you wanna gather some ideas here why are we seeing this why do you think we re seeing that relationship what did you guys say because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size you re not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands usually ok so i have a question for everyone in class i bought some new shoes and i like them do you like them they re so big on you they re a little loud don t worry i won t wear them on testing days they look good what s the problem here they re like way too big like twenty sizes too big how do you know why do you know that my foot s not this big yeah it doesn t look proportional to my body and exactly what megan said bodies in general are proportional now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long really lanky arms or you might know someone that has extremely long legs they re kind of fitting outside that pattern but in general bodies are proportionate right and so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics right because of this idea that we are proportioned you re not gonna see shaquille o neal wearing a size three shoe he ll fall over he wouldn t be able to support his own body common sense applies here that s a good one jump height so you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there s no indirect or direct relationship why do you think we saw that jump height is an ability versus ok jump height is an ability you are correct it depends on muscles versus structure ok so it s depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot i remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high i could jump in itself so i guess with your foot depending on what size shoe you have that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body by having them reach guys what was your point when you set up your lab cause i remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you re gonna have them make a mark and then they re gonna jump well it s so that the taller people didn t just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them cause then it s already the distance like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are ok so you re saying that by measuring the height you factored that idea in so mr bieber isn t totally outjumping say adrian who s a little bit shorter so you already kind of factored that in why did we not see a connection though megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe opposed to foot cause everybody kind of jumped the same there wasn t any variation so it didn t really matter what foot size you have ok so when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly they found the same general area in that same general pattern that s why theres a trend it was all in just one spot so in general when we re looking at fossils would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil no probably not which kind of makes sense anyway group two group two didn t get their data plotted but let s take a peek they did foot fossil length and height if you were to make an assumption if there was a relationship what would you all assume would be the relationship direct why direct cause it s proportional bingo bodies are proportional you re gonna see that pattern as we work through this proportional ok average stride we didn t really get a graph but it didn t look very direct it was a little more indirect more indirect i think so like this so you re saying longer no no like there wasn t really a pattern oh so your e saying no relationship yeah does that make sense alana says no i saw this why well just based on the proportional idea if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs so you re arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship i think a direct you would say direct claire and then barrett well cause we had the same thing but a little bit different and well backwards it couldn t really be that accurate because it wasn t a very long distance and people had different ideas of walking some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower it wasn t just like an average so you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct but you re saying you agree that we should see direct no we should see an indirect an indirect longer leg shorter strides direct longer legs longer strides but you re arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn t lend itself to collect proper data yeah ok good point i think it was also just i was asked just to walk like i normally do and i don t take very long strides i kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when i just normally walk ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am i supposed to walk so maybe we could have captured it in a different manner we could have designed the experiment if you re already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride i think no relationship is accurate because my stride length i would assume is based on how long my legs are i have very long legs but everybody knows i have a small foot i mean i m still proportional like i m normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else ok so you re kinda arguing that maybe you re not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional there was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides it was kind of just all over the place ok so what are we labeling this direct question mark no relationship question mark if we re basing it on the data that they had i d say no relationship ok if we re basing it on the data even though we didn t plot it looking at their actual data we would say no relationship could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship yes so for our data collection we ll leave no relationship but keeping in mind that very valid point that if you re gonna have longer feet more than likely you have longer legs more than likely you re gonna take longer strides but inherent as claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment that maybe that didn t shine through group three hair color versus foot fossil length no relationship is this shocking to anyone yes even though they had a great numeric scale why why no relationship bubs i didn t have anything to do with it it s like a gene base hair color is determined by your dna does your dna determine your foot length yes it does but not the same gene ok but not the same gene ok now you re getting very technical i appreciate that yes sir i think its partially because would you think that there would be a connection like smaller foot lighter hair well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others ok so maybe you re arguing the sample size the idea that we were to survey globally maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller would have different i could see that yeah well i think it has nothing to do with it because i m six feet tall and franco s under five feet and we both have dark hair so obviously yeah it s got nothing to do with it ok so on face value looking at hair color would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color no ok i would agree there s no connection there no connection my question though is there are organisms that lived in the past and we have very i would say we have certain ideas about what their coloring was like how would we come up with that then how would scientists come up with that idea of the coloring of certain organisms caroline well if you say that lizards would be or dinosaurs would be green it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don t know for sure so you re thinking evolutionary connection it ll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment yeah yes claire i think you also said a few days ago about how you re supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now so if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now ok so again you re doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color possibly due to some benefit we can assume in the past good nice job,1.0
what part of soccer you really want to know what about the measuring or even the measure that s what you ve got to figure out or how long you can okay i mean how many like times you can do it okay so you could sit there and count how many bounces kicks or you could sit here with the timing how much you can do it and how much time you need okay how many per minute so you ve got lots of ideas you re going to have to choose that do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other yeah okay so i think you have both come up with all four of you you guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one and you ll collect your data and you ll collect your data and then present it as a company how about that soccer team or company alright alright you ve got a good name alright that s part of it it works catch your attention i know stephanie we re having trouble because we barely decided on it we didn t do the friction one but the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle the little car that you pull back and see how far it goes okay and the parachute one so i thought of the parachute one what do you think yeah you re a team on it okay so what are you going to measure with a parachute pardon yeah you re going to use metric which is centimeters stephanie s got control of the metrics so can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes well we don t know how far because we know we can t throw it out the window oh no it s too far okay but you know what maybe on the counter you guys are coordinated i would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights how high you could you could do some test runs right yeah don t you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision okay yeah and you know what if you d like if we have time i want you to do test runs in here but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear that s what i was thinking okay but i do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final but make your hypothesis what you re thinking because i think you re on a roll here it s going to be good i don t like his interview so how far in this experiment can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something okay i think you re making another experiment right so what s your first experiment just how fast it would drop by itself how fast from one distance yeah okay so one distance you re going to see how fast it ll drop and then you re going to compare that to from that distance adding weights to it okay alright well i wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights okay so she s got one experiment and you ve got another one do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together you do yours and you do yours because you only can change one variable at a time right yeah so what s your variable you re going to measure i m going to measure the distance how far how high different distances and what are you going to do and you re going to time it right yeah okay and you re going to do what s your variable that you re going to change the weight okay but you re going to see how fast it drops yeah alright so i think you re going to need another paper okay because you ve got two experiments going are you going to support each other in each one yeah that s pretty cool double points how are you guys doing oh i like it okay tell me about this one okay so we re going to get two or three different size basketballs like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then yeah and then we re going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there so like how high it bounces depending on its size oh so the size of the balls to see how high it bounces okay if it bounces higher what do you think i think the small one will bounce higher because there s less material to like have to drop from there like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn t go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher so based on your observations you re a good observer so your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would whoa are these your averages yeah they re my averages wow okay good so how are you guys going to present it as a team she s probably going to do like what we thought would happen and i m probably going to do the results of what actually happens are you comfortable with that uh huh okay to make it really clear what you did yeah yeah okay i think that ll be really good because this is great this is great to show and then you re writing your conclusion with numbers in it i like that and then you told yours was rejected right yeah okay now does that mean you re a failure no do you guys mind going first sure because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment i think that might give them some confidence and it ll take the pressure off them because they don t really want to go first okay so let s go aqui tenemos que cambiar la friccion sobre dos tenemos que cambiar oh wow the graph looks good and your data chart looks good so jenni will you shows yours on the first dictation thing when we have to go up there do we have to go up by step like show everything what do you think or just show our graph what do you think would be the best i say showing the graph should we show like our question and then should we show the whole thing what do you think i don t know i think so showing both okay but it s probably the most important thing to convince them i d definitely show your data okay we ll show his because it s better than mine okay very good and let s see yes it looks professional so these numbers how many times did you do this experiment three times wait four three twelve 100 i don t know because there s five and there s three okay we ve got one two three four five trials here is that correct no we went up three but he wrote trials for these oh okay so we can fix that que dibujaste no tienes que poner esto tienes que poner esto it s very neat so you added one two three and divided by by three okay alright that s how you got the average yeah okay and who figured out the answer me jenni wow jenni we did was it highest to lowest yeah highest minus lowest divided by two awesome you definitely should show this and then this would be uncertainty yeah and these are the mounted distance with different kinds of what are these five things the shoes okay the shoes it gets tiring when you have to do it three times right now my question is if you didn t have the shoes how did you get the data for it i did it at my house you did them at your house okay and then what s this one right over here the socks okay and that s one you definitely did at school yeah we did it here and we also did the vans here and the vans alright so that s good would you explain that to the class yeah that these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error yeah because of the surface like at his house it would have been not like floor it would be carpet or something like that yeah what s your floor like where you did it well i had to do it like outside during the rain oh my goodness okay so you ve got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any yeah okay maybe it would and so what would a scientist do in the next time would have done it in a dry place yeah do it in a dry place yeah i like that okay so you ll tell that for the next time yeah but i really liked how you guys didn t give up how you actually did the socks compared to your vans and you know how you pull those out what are research we could have done your boot oh yeah my boot yeah i could have want to do my boot no i m good no my legs are tired okay i m sure they are well did you accept or reject your hypothesis accept we accepted it and tell us why because you ve got the evidence right there don t you the experiment like that one question we had it goes with the real world or something like that could you repeat this experiment the whole thing yeah or could anybody do this experiment yeah it s easy it is did you write your procedure so it s easy it s hard to write a procedure because it okay and if you had to do this experiment over again would you do it any differently or not no would you test for anything else good point how much pressure right okay alright any other questions nice job thanks jenni s team sorry to rush you guys but we got the idea what was your experiment our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk uses four different pairs of shoes like adidas converse or vans the adidas would go the farthest the vans no just show the data you were correct and you were correct because the adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116 6 centimeters we accepted our hypothesis jenni continue this why me because you re professional well we were going to do an interview but we forgot to so what do we do it s really bad why do you think it s bad jenni i don t know esta bien esta bien well here s the amount of distance and here s the kind of and i marked them as the average they all went so we can see that the adidas went more than the vans did because the vans were like the lowest will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again oh yeah well it s because jose did half of the experiment he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and i think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry so i think that affected the experiment there s probably different traction on shoes si simon what kind of shoe would you try next time a boot oh like my major walking boot si alright what would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot if you look at the well because it s soft so i think it ll go farther possibly go farther okay alright that would be interesting to try out does everybody see how this can apply to real life tienen preguntas hablan en ingles no espanol can you explain how this would apply to real life if you aren t just moon walking jose jenni don t look at me i don t know go on the actual moon gym class yeah gym class does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class sometimes okay some people do i don t you don t yeah like these shoes they slide a lot like in the gym okay so it might be different shoes for different jobs yeah okay well thank you nice job good we have time for our last presentation thank you alright sorry to rush everybody i know you could talk more about it thanks for being a good audience hello class how are we doing today good so our title was dirty water versus clean water thank you our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water,1.0
so how is that energy different things like jules which are increments which are similar kilowatts hours and bcu okay you could also measure it with a thermometer if it s kinetic energy sometimes okay i have an cubic feet tons and gallons too that s mass and volume oh cause it was like hold on totally different thing i don t remember while she s looking at that what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about well there are no no explosions that s a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power oh i have and it states in lots of articles about nuclear waste that it produces very little waste at all well i have a cubic feet it s for like natural gas tons is measured for coal kilowatts hours is for electricity it doesn t pollute the air you could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it and then the disadvantages for geothermal energy is the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15 which isn t it s not that great and there s a limitation of it you can t just like keep reusing it and reusing it i think that would be like a possibility for a scenario but like we don t know if it s warm enough to be able to do that yeah if there was a good spot around our area it might be good but how would you know if your area was a good spot i don t know they would have to do tests and stuff plus i don t know that people would want it in their backyard it s hard because cranberry if we re thinking of where those people well like a civilized area people really don t want something that smells bad yeah that they don t want any disruption and where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from there are inside of the earth right but it s inside of the earth but it comes out in what ways in geysers in geysers or what else i m not sure volcanoes oh yeah so who that s definitely something you don t have volcanoes everywhere either yeah right and you definitely wouldn t want that in your backyard and sometimes if there would be a good area maybe the state or the country would buy the property to like put it there because it s a good spot sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff they like buy the property okay okay i had hydro electric and some of the pros that is it doesn t pollute at all and the actual running of the power plant is really cheap and then it s really reliable so say there was a big power outage in the area the hydro electric power plant could get that running again but it s run by building dams in rivers and they re extremely expensive to build which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that a different a business or something but it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals and people and houses i have a question for you do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here i don t think you could necessarily use the creek the connoquenessing yeah but yeah you have to have like a big river and it has to be fairly out of the way would it like cause flooding yeah you couldn t have any houses really upstream because could they d flood and for example your science book says that the hoover dam which is on the colorado river it created a waterfall of 400 feet which is more than twice as high as the niagara falls so you re talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop because the water creates the kinetic energy am i saying that right yeah and that s what causes the electricity correct so if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here that might that might work and again the whole yeah the three rivers that could do it because there s a bunch of big rivers in pittsburgh yeah yeah but if you build that up wouldn t that flood well not in the middle of the city you could maybe do it like out of the city cause the rivers aren t just like in the city they go out and also if you have a good area flooding wouldn t matter so much if you pick the right area which i mean i guess the whole thing so definitely not in cranberry here where we live well we get a lot of rain around here so i m just like flooding would be like a problem yeah we re sort of in a drought right now there s not been a big rain for a long time does it harm the animals that are in the river it s better for farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there s more fish and stuff but there s less plants and stuff like upstream it floods the animals and homes and so it doesn t really hurt too much down stream i guess it depends because the farmers need deeper waters but not if there s less life in it because that s what they re trying to achieve rachel tell us about yours my energy is fossil fuels the pros were that it s the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use it s easy to find if you know in the general area of where it s at it makes up half or more of our energy in the united states the cons are that it s non renewable there s a limited supply it makes a lot of pollution when it s mined it s expensive to transport it harms aquatic life with pollution it takes millions of years to form that s something i didn t know about fossil fuels that it takes a very long time to develop it has to be like compacted uh huh so maybe the big plant it might be able to not might be able it would probably run out fast if we started using it a lot so there wouldn t be a point in making this huge plant and then it just run out yeah so it might be something people would use more often in the future just little by little like just for little things what do you mainly use it for like energy but like what falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels coals and oils and natural gas yeah yeah and you said it when you mine it so we would have to transport it here there s so many people that live here that wouldn t want that isn t that what happened in mexico what s that called the gulf of mexico yeah weren t they mining for fossil fuels like oil oil yeah and that happens so that s like a natural disaster and that s happened a bunch of times so it s not that safe so for our scenario what do you think would be the best two maybe nuclear around here out of the way a little so it wouldn t create any huge explosions so thermal energy transfers into electrical energy so it s kind of like biomass cause they both you burn both of them except yours you use mine s not renewable yeah yours you use like uhm what s it called like plants fossilized plants and stuff and for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that actually isn t the isn t the fossilized or fossil fuels or whatever don t they keep on making them yeah fossilized yeah but it can t it takes so long to make them because you need all the pressure and the decomposing like plants and animals that once it runs out it s going to take a while for us to get more like thousands of years it takes to replenish yeah it takes a long time yeah it takes a very long time for sure so i think keeton i don t think yours would be the best for our community to use it s running out anyway yeah so how much pollution does it cause a lot why does the world just use it if it s running out why waste it we talked about the efficiency what s the efficiency cost of fossil fuels i wasn t sure i couldn t find the exact uh 38 to 47 that s actually really good cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something so that may have something to do with what your decision is right the efficiency of the energy i think so i just you should save some of it you don t need to save it but it s not that good of an idea to rely on this energy source that s not going to last forever that s why i say you could also use that as a backup plan because if we use something that s renewable like katelyn s or something but something like a disaster happens that could always be our just our fall back that we know we could use that if we have to just like an emergency generator it s like you know it s there if you need it you can use it and it can last for a little bit since it is running out would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case oh definitely save it save it i say save it too now i actually think save it because i think probably save it i would say to save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you ll be able to go back to it but if you use it all then you couldn t go back to it so what are you all proposing as your primary energy source biomass okay cause it doesn t cause that much pollution and then they harness that pollution like katelyn said they capture it and then they use it for different things like growing trees or cause the only thing that the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide and they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff wow interesting yeah i thought that was pretty good so i think katelyn s definitely provides the most for the community definitely out of all yeah i have high effiecency rates so you ll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it yeah the colorado river isn t actually renewable energy s that good of an efficiency rating actually actually the the hydro electric energy is nearly 95 efficient wow once you build it since tidal doesn t use any fuel either it s just once you built it but the down side on building is it costs so much so i don t understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things you could do it to create more biomass like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil plant roots or plants just try to find research to make that happen more quickly speed up the process so it wouldn t be a non renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything there s no they said the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that they only create like a small amount of energy and so we can t really do that in silicone valley what about the three rivers in pittsburgh could we not somehow harness that we were talking about that i was like talking about redirecting the river redirecting the river just making one big one yeah i think that we would be able to use the three rivers in pittsburgh because they re all pretty big rivers so if we just put like one dam in there and then we harness the energy from all three i think that we could get a lot of energy from it i don t think it d be enough energy like to completely rely on it i think that we d still have to use other resources to still create energy because i know the title it only creates 10 hours of energy a day but i don t know if that means like an hour of that energy runs like a power plant it didn t exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing so i don t i don t think that d be a good idea to completely rely on that and put it in the three rivers and doesn t then the with the title energy too there has to be a difference in the the low and high difference in the low and the high yeah three meters of low and high yeah so where did you find out where in the world there is that difference yeah they said the biggest title it was in france or something but we don t have any in the united states because we don t have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference oh wow so there s none used in the united states and i don t think we could use that then well what you were saying before about how like each energy source we basically have to fall back on another one yeah because none of them we could completely rely on to supply all of our energy i think that we would definitely need at least two choices at least two and if we had to pick two i would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way yeah like you only need a little bit and it can produce a lot of energy and the efficiency rating s pretty high it s like 35 so yeah wow that is pretty high remember you said it was like really hazardous yeah it doesn t produce a lot of air pollution or greenhouse gases but if like one small accident is made then it can cause like a really big disaster which would be bad for a community of people since there are so many people in it i think that katelyn and kelsey were talking about like different kinds of energy sources and according to issels uh issues,1.0

generation to generation yes very good what were you going to say you know when we were looking on that website we were looking on that website and one said washoe okay yes so some of them they attri they say that they did it but we don t know who did what petroglyphs but in our state can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably and maybe if they found petroglyphs where your location was you could say those were shoshone petroglyphs would that work we re washoe washoe i m sorry all right so who wants to share theirs first so what you re going to do is you re going to share it and show the whole group and tell us what yours meant to you okay okay addy you want to call on somebody since everybody is dying to talk who s going first coleman coleman can we see yours okay i want to zoom

then there s and this has been happening for three days okay dakota mine kind of blew up here mine kind of blew what happened to yours honey it like kind of didn t turn out so well it like blew up in pieces can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces well it was like i don t know did you have like hunting symbols or anything no he just did like squares i drew lines because i i remember i didn t really know what to write you didn t know what to write okay that s all right but if you could do it again what would you do what would it mean to you i d probably make up a war thing a war thing okay it s more war except hunt hunting oh okay did you go miss addy okay humans were hunting for humans that s what s on mine okay addy i would wait until everybody was listening thank you i can t show your okay just show the other children it s a sunny day a snake is trying to eat the fish the fish are in the river cool what s the little zigzag mountains oh those are mountains oh cool sun snake river just fishing just fishing so what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe what would have been your tribe only baskets we could have maybe tried to weave something what else basket but that wouldn t be too fun in our project like we could pretend that we were real,1.0
so our question was what are the reasons why holden has a sudden acceptance of letting phoebe grow up and i got this question because i feel like the carousel represents growing up because you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you re not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you re just sheltering them and they re just going to live a sheltered life so they can t really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing yeah i agree with him with damon because i think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life because it never really stops just continuously goes around and around and the goal is to grab the golden hoop and i think that symbolizes i don t know happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it and if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants it s just like no i m not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want they re sheltering them from their own happiness kind of because i also agree with brandon but i also think that let s just say phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off i don t know if holden would go to her but i think based on his character he would but then i think that would be bad just because like brandon was saying if you don t let them fall if you don t let them make their own mistakes then they re not gonna learn from life so like my dad he s so overprotective i think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves not necessarily because i think that s their fear learning from their mistakes so i just think it s better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life i think people have a hard time letting go of any child whether it s their brother their sister their actual child because it means that they re leaving soon and they re actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister they don t want you to experience the same thing that they did too so they re like telling you what to do and it seems like they re telling you how to live your life but they re giving you advice i think parents the reason that they re so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss because it really is and innocence is in a way you know because you don t know and so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they re actually making them sad if they just won t relax so they can and also i think a lot of kids don t understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you ve been born they preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they re trying to shield you from everything but they re just trying to look out for what s best for you but you can t think of it like oh once this one chance goes by i ll never have it again because it really is like a carousel you re gonna keep going on and you will have another chance going back to the carousel i also thought that the carousel it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it so i think holden kind of realized that even though the carousel he knows have different people on it you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can t always keep them the same like the carousel it s not a real machine or something we all have to grow up eventually just listening to you guys what do you think about when i was home in los angeles my nephew at that time was about six months old and at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that like leaves you d show him an apple and he s like ahh and then he puts a leaf in his mouth and you re just like holy you have to dig it out kind of a thing so in one respect i mean it s just like there s this idea of let people figure out things on their own but in that respect he ll die if you let him figure out oh you can t eat that so i m just trying to think as far as a parent goes how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them and i think that s part of the conflict holden is having he s trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like i know that i have to let you go and i think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are like if you do what you re supposed to do and you show them that you re working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you that s true and i also think that it s not really based on yourself mostly it s based on your parents and how they ve grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it s just nature you just know when they re ready that s what i think i don t think really it s just based on all of their mistakes i just think it s pretty much based on interesting i think when people start changing and stuff like their attitude because i ve noticed my little brother he s starting to change and he has an attitude now he s starting to get a little rebellious and stuff and i think that s when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own and it s not just being told what to do and stuff you have to have that experience to learn from every person has their own free will like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can t make it drink you can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can t force them to do anything you can just have an influence on them and that s something that parents have to understand you can t force your kids to do their homework but you can ground them if they don t all right guys i want you guys to keep going you guys are doing a great job i can see your notes are also looking pretty good i m gonna move on to another group okay but keep this going because i think you guys can come up with a lot more okay thank you guys you guys are doing an awesome job with your volume we re gonna come over to this group over here all right can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up we have a couple of questions we have like oh okay let s just come up with tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about the first question is my question which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people and i kind of came up with that question because holden he kind of was denied of his childhood because allie died and so that really impacted him and since that he s kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of phoebe like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she s too big for it he s like no you re not he s trying to help to her keep that innocence or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied it kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing it goes against like parent versus child so a parent when they have a child they kind of want to live their life through their child and they make them do all these chores to get into because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn t want them to do it so they kind of interesting i said that i just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps i had these two other questions because i was reading the book where i was wondering why i was trying to get more in depth with why holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye okay so i kind of answered it and i said it s very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can t get back up just like when you lose your innocence you can t get it back because this experience happened if you get exposed to it you can t magically forget it it just stays with you and that s a part of you that s just lost interesting that kind of relates back to the question about it seems like holden is kind of holding onto his past and so he s still living in that innocent stage and when he s living an innocent stage he can t make a wrong decision which is very hard from his now because he s 16 he keeps transferring to all these schools and he can t really grow up because he still has that memory and so that s why he s confused about his identity good point going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people it kind of goes through influences too like he was talking about james castle and when he died he said that james liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about oh yeah that s a pretty great idea it s not bad but why would people be waiting for that it was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas and i think going back to that question again that sometimes parents want the best for their child so they convince their what they want their child to be if that makes sense and at the end sometimes you can t force the child to do what they don t want to do so in a way it s kind of like you guys said the parent versus the child they wanna form their own identity as a teen but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them is that what we re kind of getting at through everything they re so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go is that what we re saying yeah kind of like holden says he s trying to protect that innocence because he s always referring to there s a part where he s walking down the sidewalk and he called allie to help him cross to the other side and that s kind of interesting because usually you don t think an adult would say that a child would say that and it s because he s mad at his parents because they won t talk about it so he s kind of just living with this interesting so he s just trying to find a way of coping is that possible yes and then there was another kind of question about where holden comes to kiana said why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on and i thought of this question because when holden was inside just his room phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like you don t like anything you don t like anything and he was trying to make up stuff that he did like like he did say he liked allie and she ll say he s dead so pick something else and he was arguing with her saying that just because he s dead you don t forget him and you can still like someone who s dead and he thinks that allie is thousand times better than nicer than people who are alive today now so that just proves how he s holding on to that and he s not planning on forgetting that and he holds that near and dear to his heart and so that s probably why he doesn t like a lot of people because he compares them to how allie was and his innocence his maturity level how it was then and how he sees how people today because kids don t understand he s holding on so he doesn t really understand what s going on anything else to add on to this no i like what you guys are doing i like how you re tying in the death of allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing what about the carousel first of all i don t know it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all cause i know he would probably ride it too did he ride it i was thinking of repetition because how the parents feel it rotates around and round and whenever phoebe passed by he would tell her how pretty she looked she was never changing that s kind of what he wanted he wanted her to stay in that stage and nothing to change nice all right guys i m gonna check on another group i want you guys to keep going with this you guys are tearing it apart good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together all right and your notes look good as well too i like it i think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more okay hi guys you guys the volume is doing really well so you guys fill me in okay tell me what you guys talked about just mostly like and symbolism in the book start getting louder,1.0
i m not gonna have no peace with that if you feel something i don t know something like done bothered me that done made me like brought me down to the point where i was crying about it the first thing he say i ain t gonna tell nobody but i feel where you coming from he tell me it shouldn t get to that point where you mad over something that doesn t matter if it s good or not that seriously don t matter that s in the past the past ain t gonna do nothing the past can t hurt you okay alright that s what i d tell him so really this kind of conversation should ve been held with what kind of friend a pretty good friend a pretty good friend or maybe even your best friend nope not your best friend oh yes my best friend you already know who i m talking about he s my best friend now he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad i ask him man why you doing this i thought you was different from everybody else but not once have i actually went out there and played the cards while i m at home how i m not gonna tell nobody and then come two days later everybody and their momma walking up to him and asking him questions uh why you did this to her so let me ask you this so your saying you ve had conversations with your best friend before and then he s divulged information that you ve said to him no from time to time he might get mad and he ll say something then we have to have that one on one talk ok this was between me and you i don t want to hear this coming out nobody else s mouth cause then i know point blank that you done said something let me ask you this if you would have that conversation with someone is he truly your best friend is that a conversation that jay chime in any time if you got to keep reminding him that hey man if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else honestly are they really your best friend no like i said before that s another acquaintance because you can t trust him like that man he telling you he ain t gonna tell nobody but he going back on his word he going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat that s why i said it s about you johnny no between what you say i don t blame johnny if he s truly your best friend he won t tell nobody he won t tell anybody but then you got like it s a boundary between stuff you tell you can tell your best best friend something deep but it s a certain boundary between that which you wouldn t tell him certain stuff i tell my best friend almost everything but certain stuff he don t need to know right cause certain things we my business don t need to be his he have one of those days when he feeling down then i come over there blah blah blah don t say nothing to me then he flips out on me and he wanna tell something that s so deep to me that i m sitting there looking like did he really just say this cause your shocked you re in shock and you don t never expect well anybody wouldn t expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that s not meant to be told me i would never expect chris to say anything i tell him so far he has been a best friend he don t tell nothing i say i don t want to have to tell what he tells me because we got that best friend relationship cause a best friend should be loyal all the way to the end not when it s necessary or needed that s right not when it s necessary but at all times right yes ma am okay alright let me go to the next scenario you decide you would like to take in a movie but you choose not to go alone you finally reach someone by phone who is just as bored as you and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant you both enjoy yourselves so much you plan to do this again where is that person at on the grading scale i d say that s a group thing because they interested in the same thing that you re interested in group friend okay alright group friend group friend someone that you know through association now in this scenario it s just you and that person and it could be someone that you met through the group or it could be it s not necessarily your best friend you just started hanging out out of the blue you met them and when your friends not around y all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then i d say that s a pretty good friend pretty good friend i could say a pretty good friend cause i would hang out with a pretty good friend a pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y all enjoy yeah because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group kind of like we re together because once again you know that person through association of someone else but a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say okay you want to go out yeah you wanna go out let s go it s nothing between you guys if its a girl you understand that she just want to see the movie and i want to see the movie we laugh we joke we go out eat pizza together but it s nothing else there we ain t trying to be boyfriend girlfriend you can t try to make it more then what it is right then if it s just a friend one of your dudes that you hang out with y all like the same movie like i you know you can t call me cause we re not on the same level i m your teacher at all times even though you know i like the same type movies you like and we always discuss the same type of movie we re not going to go to the movies together cause you on the adult level we on the young people level right and we re different types of our friendship scale is different is not even up here it s right okay now someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum you were glad to hear it because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway so your parents tell you both that you can go and you can the exhibit is in a different city your parents tell you both that you can go and you can spend the night over out of town what kind of friend is that is that just an acquaintance that would probably be with like with my best friend i wouldn t go out of town with somebody that s not by best friend i ain t going to go out of town i got to go with somebody that i know is going to speak to me you know what i m saying mm hmm got to be somebody i can trust i don t have to many friends i can trust i don t know why but all my friends is just the reason why i don t get too close to them i can t exactly tell you why i just don t because i can t trust everybody okay alright because you ll never know who will be your best friend today and they might turn on you tomorrow so you ll never know okay so that s why this is a good piece to do because we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance who is someone we that we will just see on the hall hi how you doing bye got to figure out who is the acquaintance and then we got to figure out who is the group friend who is a good friend who is the best friend because there s somewhere there s a fine line like you guys said there s a fine line between all five of them but you got to know the line you got to know where the line is drawn you got to know the conversations to have with all of them because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend that you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall right right cause there like you just telling me your whole business but you don t really know my name or nothing about me that s something the stuff you telling me i wouldn t tell you i would tell it to my best friend but as far as what s going on in my house i ll probably let you know i got sisters and brothers the basic stuff but not oh my momma s strung out or doing this and that cause everybody s business is not your business your business is not are you that s right we always got to keep that in mind because so many times i ll get calls from parents and they ll say so and so just talking too much especially when people are getting into a lot of issues or getting into confusion at school or what have you and a lot of that comes from the fact that they don t know when to be quiet or they don t know what to say or how to say it or who to approach because if someone says to you stand up for a minute in the morning when you first come in and the first thing i say to you is what good morning good morning good morning vincent how you doing good morning ms jenson how was your weekend i went to my cousin house i got to spend time with my godmother and i went grocery shopping okay so that now you told me i didn t say what did you do oh i said how was your weekend it was good it was good and that s basics of that conversation it should not be oh guess what my momma my momma and her boyfriend was fighting and they threw the cat out the window and then the police came over because at that moment you have just did what stepped out of bounds you ve stepped out of bounds you ve divulged way too much too much you done opened the book before it could be read or you done read the book before it could be bought because really i didn t buy into all of that i didn t want all of that you just wanted to know your name and how was your weekend i just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend and then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper but you not asking for that you just asking for the simple that s right that s right jeremy i m going to ask you stand up for a minute jay cause you re a pretty secretive guy mmhm so normally we got to pull stuff out of you cause i said to you earlier i said your dad called and what was that about i was stuck on the river and he said i was stuck on the river my first thought was jeremy got a boat so i said you got a boat that s what i said right yeah i was over there at the wafflehouse over there by brian gates behind over there at the apartments i went to see someone and so he went to see someone but again sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation and when to divulge it and when to divulge it because even though he went to see someone he didn t give me no elaborate details yeah this honey she was because a lot of times you don t need that i don t need that you just wanted to know where i was at just wanted to know where you was at i want to make sure you was okay make sure that your dad got in touch with someone to be able to say jeremy s okay okay alright alright yeah you can have a seat that was a good conversation huh this was a good conversation this was a good conversation you thought this was a good lesson today was a good day it was a good day because some people don t know their boundaries of talking and telling it all some people just give up too much information some people around here got to even say what did to you and everything from here we re going actually the next thing we re going to discuss is conversations that s where we re going to go from here i wanted us to because the other day we kind of looked at friendship but i wanted to go a little deeper because i know i want us to realize that friendships they should be reciprocal not always and when i say reciprocal everybody understands what i m saying the same no should be the same like how i feel about you you should feel that same way about me i feel like you trustworthy but you feel like i m going to tell on you any chance i get right exactly but they re not always reciprocal but keep in mind that friendships are always changing because who you put down on your friendship scale on thursday it change it changed you gave me a whole different not a whole different set but you gave me some different people and you actually moved some people where you had yolanda as a good friend she became just a group friend four days later okay and you had valid reasons and keep in mind that things do change just because someone was a best friend last week don t mean they going to stay your best friend they re not nine times out of 10 i promise you guys when i was in high school i could there were three there was four of us and i considered them my very best friends now i don t know how deep they would ve had my back but i considered them my good friends we talked on the phone we shared secrets we shared stuff you know when we was sneaking and doing stuff we shared those things but today i really can t tell you where they re at now there was some friends that i met in college that we re still friends to this day they re friends that i ve had since i came into teaching that i don t know where those people are because i ve been teaching when you think of teaching for 18 years people have friends people have come and gone in the teaching profession but i haven t kept in touch with all of them because there has to be a there has to be something in common that s going to keep you friends it can t just be i see if i see them just at school and that s all we ever talk about is school and schoolwork and complain and fussing and about lesson plans and stuff then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates those are just acquaintances people that i pass in the hall we laugh we joke but we don t share any intimate conversation okay i m glad this was a good exercise for you guys and next time we re going to look into conversations the type of conversations you have with each one of those type people,1.0

at first we put only tap water in it and then we all of a sudden changed it so but there s still tap water in with the oily water so you think that s why the control got messed up because it had too much well that s not variables changed my only reason what s the other reason my other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was like the seeds were duds were your guys s the oil ones that one s not yours no ours is the one that s all grown oh why don t you go get your cup and show people so this is oil okay well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden it died it looks like kind of so like at first it was normal with that thing and then well i don t understand that chart yeah me neither because it looks like it looks like it didn t grow then it grew really really fast then it went down super what happened was it grew and then it over polluted and then it just died looks like that well like well like what i don t get is i see the other oil one it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones it just like suddenly grew all of a sudden all the oil is the same with the control which you have all of a sudden all of a sudden also these diagrams also in the control diagram that went back down to zero centimeters i don t know yeah this chart might have messed up because that means both these plants die and then the control regrew yeah it doesn t make any sense it doesn t it turned white and then it died and turned brown because on my chart it grew point it grew it grew 0 14 and then 0 14 again and then 0 04 so like alive dead alive and stuff when it grew the second time did it grow or did it subtract the second time i think it died and then the last time it just kept on growing but the first time it started growing it grew second time it grew one centimeter what did you put in to help it grow what did you put in it to help it grow oily water so did the oil or the manipulator control grow more the manipulative one grew more because it grew and then it died so why do you think it did that because like i what i thought is that it was too much oil on it and then oil gets on the leaf it like it helps the plant grow or something just killing other doesn t the plant feed off the leaves so the oil got spread on the leaves and then it s feeding the oil then it died look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant do you i think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because like acid is good for you and it s mixed with water so it s not too bad for the plant but i think it got way too much acid and acid actually eats things it kills it and that s why i think the plant is all dead because like you said nolan it did grow because acid is good for us but yet when we have too much it dies so that s why i think this plant is all shriveled over i agree with you because acid is part water and that s what rain is but there s a little bit of acid so water s good for you but acid it doesn t grow it s not good for you so well actually it is good for you but not a lot i think you re maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on maybe it got too much acid rain and then the acid rain overtook the water and died so it like decreased by a lot that s why i think it s just like the red bull because red bull is like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy see right there just like red bull it increases and then decreases what d you think misha well yeah i think like what you said nolan because the regular plant grew just fine and then that the experiment grew like good and better than the regular one but then it like the acid overtook the plant just like nolan said what else i noticed about my control plant it started big at first and then it decreased in size then it got bigger so it s going off and on in size so it actually did kind of better than this because at the end it did better than that one and the last opposite it like died after the second one it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks yeah but it was only to a point it was living because when i did my second observation it was still kind of full but it was broken on the side so it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water basically it died my actual skin and everything the plant grows faster but it also dies faster and i figured from like the oils on my hand why do you think it did that because the oil on your hand because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as like oils in a car but oil still has the same base but how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand i don t know instead of wearing gloves maybe it s just the stuff inside of the oils and everything but it grew faster and also died faster like the plant that we have now is dying faster but this one since it has water normally and everything it s healthy and stayed big the whole time but the other one is like that but it died if you have what you were saying earlier when you have oil on your hand and then it was you polluted it with oil don t you think you polluted that one too no well like it s my whole point is that it speeded up the process what speeded up the process like the oil when i plant a bean or something when i plant bulbs for tulips or something and i touch it with my hands instead of my gloves then it actually seems i may just be paranoid but it grows faster and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn t grow as fast i don t know the depth of that part or something i don t get what you re saying are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster no i think it s just the oils of your skin so what would the oils in your skin do for a plant like the oil for your plant here is it the same like the oil that we used like it didn t make them healthy but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger but the other one show me your data that suports that this yeah what s your data that supports that the these ones yeah the one the data that supported it was that oops is is it went with the control it already had grown and it was after a week and ours still hasn t grown and it was growing at 0 16 centimeters per day and then the next time it was growing 2 7 centimeters a day so what does that tell you that it was growing a lot faster but it wasn t necessarily growing as efficiently okay what do you mean by inefficient efficient what do you mean by efficient i mean like it grew faster but it wasn t necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast so was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn t healthy yeah because the leaves now they re all gross and blotchy and they re dying and they re crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these and they have a shine to them because of the oil what did the rate of growth confirm that at first it was kind of spiked for a little bit and then it started going back down and now it s dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants it grows in a steady period of time with that it grew really fast and now it s dying really fast so what conclusion did you get that oil still makes the plant grow but it s not necessarily healthy for it do you agree yeah because me and because my group my experiment when we did this it was growing super fast and now it s like dying and stuff and we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because on the grass a little bit and the number of leaves will only be like two and then it shrivels up and died and then the color would stay light green and kind of brown like how it is right now and then my data was according to my graph the acid rain plant grew more than i thought it grew 25 centimeters but it started to die because of it turns light brown and started to die the leaves increased from two all the way to six leaves by the end okay my question was what would the effect be if i changed the water to salt water and i put if i change the water to salt i predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant i predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant i predict the color will be white ish gray ish my manipulator variable is water to salt water according to my data i was correct because the height was the same and the number of leaves were the same the data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants the rate of the growth was zero on the salt water there was crust on it and it was restate that so that jessica gets it and see if jessica knows and then like we were saying olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt and then like you know how water it attracts a lot of light and so people get tan yeah faster and then so maybe the shine for the oil maybe it attracted more of the heat from the light and it burnt the leaves so like the glisten from it yeah maybe that s why it looks all burnt and because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it s a burnt reel piece of paper something like sands off in the reel of a video and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen that s what it kind of reminded me of because it has a brown wrinkle around it and then it s dark and then it s kind of brown and crisp so that s what it kind of reminded me of and that s what made me think of it yeah and then how i thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how olivia said that when you re in water it attracts more heat and light to you so maybe that s how so that s how i got the idea of maybe that s what happened so do you have anything to add jared no you jessica no okay okay so i think the reason why mine didn t grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water because when mr kelson sprayed it all of the salt right here you could feel it it s all stuck to the top so the water can t get down to the soil and all that so it can t grow at all,1.0
yes i think if it s really really quiet and you want to talk about something then go ahead but if a lot of people obviously want to talk probably a good idea to raise our hands okay what else be involved be involved yes i will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion because everybody has an opinion but i need you to express that opinion what else don t criticize other peoples ideas don t criticize other peoples ideas okay what might you do instead suggest something give your outlook give your opinion okay give your argument but don t insult the other person s ideas this is a safe place to share ideas okay now we re going to have three jobs i m going to need a task master a reader and a time keeper time keeper you want to be the time keeper alright you need to let us know when we ve got about two minutes left of the class i want to be the task master okay so what does the task master do they make sure that everybody s on task yeah what else what might that look like subjects get off or out of control so people get off subject we could a little bit of crowd control what about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands you get to pick on one yeah task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk okay yes is there a praiser actually that s a good idea let s have a praiser i want to be him you want to be the praiser alright michael is the praiser what s the praiser do oh can i do that dang it always you can team up with me can we this class yeah you guys want to be a team okay so what is a praiser what are you guys going to do give compliments okay give compliments compliment their ideas their expressions okay and then i need a reader preferably somebody on that side of the room i don t know how to read i m unavailable you ll read no who would like to read about five seconds before i call on someone i ll do it okay so the questions are all up here there s five of them you re going to read them so the whole group can hear okay okay alright so task master oh i m here okay you re on task now and we re going to start by having the reader read us the first question okay should people own ideas i don t really think so i think it should be shared like for public opinion like public knowledge like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet great thought thanks you re doing good well i think that the information should be shared but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it i think that if you come up with an idea shouldn t you have some like you have conferences everybody gets together and talks about stuff so why don t you have scientists and stuff that like created this idea come together and have a conference and talk about it so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff and then the people that made that contributed to it have like a patent i guess you would say or just like copy or not copyright it like discovered by or yeah like that good opinion so coming together would be easier then sometimes i feel like if if no one gets credited or gets yeah they won t want to like they won t want to put the information out there yeah put the information out there like they won t have something to you know work for work for there you go yeah because i think that everybody like wants a part of getting like because you want that credit because you put all that effort into it so why not get a little bit of credit that makes it worth it how do you like that one okay second question should people own genes no yes well you kind of already own your own genes i mean you kind of they re your own like any unless you clone yourself i mean nobody else has the exact same stuff you could let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene the breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video which is actually a lack thereof of a particular part of a gene that is patented by a particular company which means they found it they spent money to find it so they own the patent on it if you are a person you don t have to be female just to look for this but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it that s what it means to own a gene i think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money that can be like oh i m going to put a patent on that so boo ya can t take it yeah i don t think that s right i mean if someone they should like put it open to the public because i mean if it s a gene like say breast cancer they should t just keep that private and make they pay for it yeah so it s sort of like owning a part of a human if you own a gene by a corporation it s like owning a part of the person who has that gene or doesn t have that gene so it s sort of a moral issue would you want to be owned by a company just that little tiny part of your dna i wouldn t excellent point you would good job jenna i wouldn t oh okay you practically just went against everything we just said anybody else have any input i agree with jen okay third question would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer yeah no i would not well it depends on what age i m at because like then you have that whole impending like doom your whole entire life like oh i m eventually going to get cancer might as well just die that s why i die but if you do know then you have the chance to actually deal with it you re going to have to deal with it anyway yeah but if you knew you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life you would know you would live life to the fullest i would i would live life to the fullest if i knew that i actually had this cancer i would know and i would do the best i could to live my life without settling yeah so the shadow of you that eventually and that would just push me forward considering drive yourself whatever i do yeah and maybe just maybe if i knew i would work to try to cure it myself so then i would be helping other people as well i would want to know remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions please feel free to share i think my what s it called my opinion i d want to know so that if you didn t know and you have kids you could be passing it on to them and wouldn t that hurt you to see that to have your kids have cancer like i would think that and then if like i did i would want to know i would like jen said live life to my fullest and because some things like if i was per se white i would go tanning wouldn t that hurt your cancer because like radiat well that s what causes it you know what i mean i d just do things differently if i had it remember what they said in the video it s often a maybe it s not a you will have this it s a maybe there are things that they can check for that they can say definitely you will or will not get like huntington s disease which is a very devastating disease remember how they talked about tay sachs which kills very early huntington s is somewhat similar but it kills later in life and starts to show signs mid 30 s and usually death is somewhere in the 40 s or 50 s so that s significantly earlier since life expectancy is in the 70 s in this country so would you want to know yes or no if you had something like huntington s which is definitely a yes or no but what about in a situation that s a maybe i don t want to know if it s a maybe because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not i would still want to know yeah because what if your body starts shutting down like one night and you just start twitching in your sleep wouldn t you want to know that s from cancer rather than your brain s messed up and drugs or something i don t know yeah i think i d want to know i mean like instead of just not knowing what s causing all this stuff happening in your body some think it s because i m a very curious person i d want to know what s going on i would want to know because like jenna said like one night you re just having a seizure or something you could take like medicine like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have rather than just like trying to deal with it and like that you could die because you never even knew what was happening so i d like want to have that back up plan with me so just to clarify we re talking about an offense end rather than a defense team so rather than waiting until you have it and reacting taking preventative measures ahead of time like an inhaler for asthma some people have to take their inhaler every single day twice a day morning and the afternoon but there s other people who don t have it as severe or a higher risk not as high as a risk who only take it when they re having an asthma attack so what you re saying is having like the pill every day constantly i would still want to take that chance so you would you want to take the pill yeah if you know you have cancer early enough can t you get rid of it can t they get rid of it if it s like yes the earlier you know the better chance you have yeah that s why i would want to know i don t think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer that doesn t mean you re going to die from it like you could get hit by a car today and nobody could tell you that nobody could predict that so i don t think i wouldn t want to know like if i was going to if i have cancer or anything i don t know i don t think it s you don t know that that cancer s going to yeah and then i m just going to be in fear all my life like thinking like oh i m going to die from that when that s not necessarily like the you know exact thing that you re going to die from like it s not a guarantee so very good yeah it s because of that great job it s because of that maybe that maybe like you might be like how that guy on the video said you have a 99 of getting a heart disorder you might be that one percent that doesn t get it and you spend your whole life preparing spending all this money on preventative measures and getting all these pills setting up stuff and then you go through your whole entire life and you don t even get it that s true that he does have a point but then wouldn t you want to take those precautions because you d be happy that you did but then you spent all that extra stuff but what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it no i mean you don t like you don t get all the stuff just in case and you don t take it s like you don t even take the medicine it s only for like when you have like travis said if you have a seizure you can take that it stops it well that s kind of just like getting hit by a car exactly preventative measures is like looking to see if there s cars and if you don t look i mean you could get run over you could not but then you also like what if you lived in fear of getting that taking all these precautions is kind of wasting your life trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen that s why people should at the right age when you have the right maturity decide whether you want to know or not and not have it mapped out when you re born whether you re going to die or not or by what in the movie how they just like took that thing right that would be freaky as a woman like you just went all throughout nine months of that and now you get to find out that your child s going to die in it s kind of freaky that actually brings us to our next question okay what genes would you want to know your children had why and how would that change you as a parent i wouldn t want to know at all i mean that s part of giving like human birth the surprise i guess it s a gamble you can t always like create the perfect human being well if you could find out what genes they were going to have could you fix them like how that person got rid of the forehead thing right now no but that is a direction we re heading in you can right now completely sequence your child s genome if you have the money and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that that s messed up i don t care what my child would look like i don t really care but i just don t like you could prevent it from having these like life threatening diseases like cancer or huntington s or like parkinson s disease alzheimer s but then again that s a way of like too like i would want to know life threatening diseases but not because like you can cure like seizures you can like can t you like my friend s been cured of that she had them and then now she doesn t anymore because she took medicine and stuff now she doesn t have it but there s people that have been taking those medicines and then still have it now which doesn t make sense is that cured or treated treated yeah cured means that you no longer have the disease treated means that it s managed with medication or it s treated then wait it s cured yeah it is cured but anyways how would that change you as a parent knowing that you would know what to do if you have it stay with your child at all times i don t want my kid dying your kid s going to be in like a stroller until age 13 see it wouldn t change me as a parent it just wouldn t change me i think it d make someone stronger because going through all of that hard times like with your child and it being sick and stuff wouldn t that make you stronger than having a normal healthy child and make you closer to them but you would still love your child the same way you would still try to have the best memories with your child either way if you knew that this that your child was going to die or not you would still do the same thing except maybe change their diet or take more precautions yeah more precautions pad their room they re going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something but you wouldn t change your experiences with your child i would well i wouldn t would you bernard what change your experience with your child yeah just don t go to disneyland it s not worth it it s not worth it he won t even remember it nope oh the fifth question what does any of this have to do with you like as in personally or as in that s a good question i m confused say that again as in personally yeah both ways as in persoanlly and as in a generation give yourself super powers hey stay on task good job stella thanks i guess you re just kind of getting us ready for the future you know like thinking like about your children like in the future like what if like what if you really wanted to know and then like what would you actually do about it if you ve never thought about this before is this technology possible yeah not quite yet so who s going to have to make those decisions us our generation this generation and next generation the genes are us and if you want to know everything about yourself if you want to know then you have to go through the genes but if you don t want to know then you don t have to yeah and so those people that think it s like that want to know should wait what never mind should be able to yeah should be able to and then the people that don t want to know shouldn t harp on them they should just keep their opinions to themselves and see it from their eyes too and just have an open eye to it not being so negative so what happens if say half of society would like to have their genomes sequenced or their children s genome sequenced and the other half does not want to or doesn t have the means to because it s probably going to cost money right what might that how might that impact society as a whole not just the individual as in this country individual s rights are paramount right hmm so it ll be messed up like it is already how,1.0
guys ready yes okay number one start give your idea read the word give your idea of the definition okay what s your word soldier okay and okay you re gonna give your idea what s your idea of soldier i think tax is like when you buy something like the extra yeah one person at a time it goes in order so what s your idea like a government so okay you need help have you ever seen a soldier before taxes for me are where money or something i don t know and what does a soldier do do you know okay he fights for freedom very good so it s someone who fights for freedom that s your definition what s your definition very good you guys keep going you re doing great let me see how this group is doing over here where are you guys at have you already given your definition yes okay did you already give yours did you already give yours did you give yours yet what do you think it is what s the word patriot very good patriot and did you listen to their ideas yeah okay and you need thinking time okay and remember you can build on their ideas too louder a little bit louder i think it means to i think it s you ve heard it in a song that word yeah yeah so someone was a patriot in a song what did it mean in the song if they were a patriot how did they feel they feel sad sometimes sad you can feel sad if you re a patriot on 9 11 when the planes crashed through the buildings people were sad because they were patriots they loved their country right and they were sad to see that can you be happy if you re a patriot too yeah when would you be happy if you were a patriot you re a patriot for the united states right or even for the country your family originally came from how do you feel about that country if you re a patriot happy happy and do you not like them or do you love them that country i love them you love them okay so a patriot is someone that what you could be more excited or happy okay and how do you feel in your heart about the country do you dislike it or do you like it a lot i like it a lot okay alright and i didn t hear your ideas but can you guys get together and agree or do you want to look it up first should we look it up to make sure we have the right idea okay everyone let s get into our books and let me make sure you have your papers too there are your papers too goodness miss bryant got ahead of herself just in case you forget the direction the page is 493 to check go all the way to your glossary page 493 to check let me see what you guys have let s see okay and where does that money go to do you guys know the government oh did you look it up to make sure that it was perfect your definition okay let s look it up real quick and make sure because it looks pretty good but let s just make sure that s my fault because i got busy with table one and didn t give you this paper so on page 493 there you go 493 it starts but then you have to go in abc order right and let s look it up and make sure you have the right definition you guys are looking up tax that s right a t t t t tax good like the way you re using your resource cause that was one of the things we said we re gonna do is use our resource okay what did you get do you know where to read it good i like the way that you worked together and helped so les what did you have taxes for new money to where where does that money go the government okay so let s add that who started this her me okay so you wanna add that you guys all agree yeah you feel good cause it s not just any money for anybody it s money to the government okay so let s add that go ahead good i like the way you used your resource and checked it a patriot is a person who loves and supports their country and that s kinda what you guys said anyway right you said they love is that what you guys said cause i wasn t here earlier did you say stuff like that oh great are all of you patriots do you love your country loves and supports their country okay now what happens it goes to person number two number two you get to read it and they re gonna repeat the question right okay there you go and here s the directions just in case you forget what is it like describe it okay let s repeat what is it like describe it you guys did you repeat let s repeat what is it like describe it okay so before we write you get to start so what is it like can you describe a patriot yes okay what is it like it s like or who is he like cause they re a person right is like someone who will respect their country who s that can you think of a person oh i m sorry honey can you think of a person who s an example let s see describe it so when you think a patriot okay they support their country what else respect the government very good those are good words so you could put that there but we re not gonna write yet right because we re gonna give everyone a chance what would you say what do you think of when you think of patriot and you would describe it if you had to describe it to someone patriot is soldier that s a great example what about you someone respect every city everywhere and respect to everybody to not be very nice can it be also honoring i like that vocabulary word honor how do you guys feel about honoring what do you say about respecting okay alright you get to write first you write one then it ll go around and each of you can write one in a box okay every one of you write something in the box if you need help ask your table for help right okay good how s it goin if something costs 7 99 it s plus like tax plus like a dollar yeah a dollar taxes come in like a dollar or two dollars just put taxes like extra money great okay now you alright so we said it protects the country fights what did you say when you gave ideas fights for his risks his life for others what do you guys think risks his life for others should we include that yeah yeah okay that s good good okay and then you re gonna write one too right what else makes that kuh sound a c and what else k you guys agree okay let s put it down a k risks i like the way you re helping each other that s great alright very nice okay and you get to put an idea down too we wanna make sure everyone gets a chance so put your idea down you can put it in any of the boxes because there s room here here or here no that s fine because we re all gonna keep going yep so i want you to put your idea that you said earlier here here or here for describing the soldier do you remember what you said what d you say very good so put that down tax is more money for the government you can just look in the book just put tax is extra money for the government we already have that oh i know tax is extra money for the government tax is i s for extra money for the government okay so has everyone given an example okay so whose turn was it to write your turn so you write first and make sure everyone gets to write one in tax is extra money for government money money money m o n e yes did you guys give your examples first yeah before you wrote okay good do your parents pay taxes yes they do everyone pays taxes that could be an example i have a question do your parents pay taxes everyone pays taxes don t they do we have to pay taxes when we get gasoline yes yes do we have to pay taxes when we buy a video game yeah everything yes everything except for food food they don t tax isn t that nice of them okay and what does the tax go to support the government the government and the schools right and the firemen the policemen good okay so now you have some more great conversation great conversation was thomas jefferson a patriot martin luther king martin luther king was a patriot good who else was a patriot abraham lincoln yes okay let s take turns though who s turn is it now who s a patriot someone who loves their country are you a patriot could you say i am a patriot i m a patriot very good there s an example can you think of someone who s a patriot a soldier a soldier why s a soldier a patriot why do you think they love their country so much what are they willing to risk their heart their heart and their what they could what could happen if they got shot they die yeah they re risking their lives so they really love their country they re really patriots aren t they very good so you ready to write who s turn is it no that s okay so whoever s next so if it s your turn you go oh okay so it s your turn so you get to write an example of a patriot try to write in a complete sentence i bet you can you just draw pictures,1.0
okay but before you check over what you need to make sure you do all of it get it completed right okay awesome so your goal would be to get homework completed wonderful okay excellent okay now i brought some extra markers and stuff here because i know you re a visual learner that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your learning styles test so this is for you to do you can choose any colors to make it look however you want okay so you ve got your goal and then we need to figure out why is that goal important so your goal is to get all homework done excellent and why is that important because when you re in fourth grade you don t get all your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence i ve been there a couple of times and is not very fun and for the good achievement you get to go to hot wheels hmm so if you don t do your homework you re on a boring fence okay you have to stand by the fence at recess and if you do do your homework you go to hotshots homework hotshots and that is what do you have to do to qualify for homework hotshots do all your homework for all the oh wow so all your homework throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go get to be a homework hotshot which means you go to hot wheels and enjoy the day skating excellent okay so you just brought up a good point umm so this goal is important because not only do you not want to stand by the fence and you want to be a homework hero what s going to happen if you do your homework you go to hot wheels you go to hot wheels and what do you think what effect is that going to have on your report card here if you re doing all your homework what s going to happen to those grades you get all the grades go up like the 100 200 that s right very good all right so go ahead write that down why you think homework is important excellent so this goal is important because you can always get good grades and homework is a way that teachers help the students reinforce the things that they are learning in class so that s an excellent way to get good grades okay so we know our goal and we know why it s important so let s think about what kind of rewards we re going to get for reaching that goal you get achievement awards you go in a limo with the principal and you go out to eat and hot wheels too right so those are some long term goals over the next nine weeks you get to complete your homework the next nine weeks you get to go to hot wheels and might even be on the principal s honor roll to take the limo ride pretty cool huh okay so that s here we ve got don t forget one thing that you get to drink soda while you re going you do i didn t know that i ve never been in there i ve never been in the limo but i heard oh my goodness well that certainly is a nice incentive something to motivate huh good so that s kind of a long term motivation we ve got to work hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that right okay so we ve got here when i meet my goal for the quarter quarter is another way of saying the nine week time period you will what what do you get to do if you do all your homework over the nine weeks i will go in a limo well that s for principal s honor roll which is definitely an option what s specific for homework umm when i meet my goal for the quarter i will go to hot wheels go to hot wheels awesome excellent so the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away can t it okay because nine weeks is not easy they are not easy to do your homework because it s a long time before you go to hot wheels and we only have eighteen weeks in school so it s easier sometimes to stay motivated and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on more of a short term basis meaning that instead of waiting all nine weeks to go to hot wheels which you will get to do if you meet your goal let s think of something that we can do maybe once a week that would be a good incentive for you study okay well studying is part of your homework plan let s say that you study and you turn all your you do all your homework and at the end of the week when i check in with you when i check in with miss butler and i check in with your granny and i d say so how did annamarie do did she get all her homework done mm hmm and they say yes she did what do you think might be something that you re willing to work towards here at school that would be a reward once a week i will come to you and i will help you you d like to help me all right so could we agree that let s say i check in on fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out did she do her homework what are they going to tell me yes yes and then on fridays you get to come and help me mm hmm that d be wonderful now i teach a first grade class every day at 12 10 i know you do a really good job helping out at home with your niece but she i do not get to see her monday tuesday wednesday thursday but on friday i do because my mom my mom watches her and sometimes when my sister and i and the baby s not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and we talk to her on phone awesome she s lucky to have an aunty like you awesome well i know because you do such a good job caring for her that you d be an excellent helper for me and my first graders will that be a good goal for you okay so our next section here can you read this when i meet my goal for the week i will get to go to go to hot wheels i think well hot wheels is for the whole nine weeks but each week remember our what we re working towards on friday that you get to come help you right so you get to come help miss charles on fridays okay you have very nice handwriting thank you okay so do you thanks okay so this goal is something that you re in charge of right you re in control of achieving this goal but you re not in it alone because there s of a lot of people who want to see you reach that goal and to see you doing an awesome job at school so who are some of the people the adults in your life who are on your team who can be helpers for you as you reach this goal my grandma my aunty my uncle my mom and my sister wonderful you have a lot of people so these are people at home that can help you reach your goal all right so let s go ahead and put those down for supporters at home awesome all right so you ve got a lot of people supporting you at home i ve got five and how about here at school who s on your team miss butler and miss charles you ve got it girl i can t wait to support you on this goal okay so the people who can help me at school is miss charles is it okay if i put in miss ficker my assistance teacher because she helps too definitely that s a great person to add and so are you thank you okay i just realized something what s that all these teachers name has a r in it miss charles miss butler miss ficker it s a good attention to detail you have there okay so we know that our goal is to get all my homework completed okay and it s important because you can always get good grades excellent now on the short term if you re doing a great job getting your homework done every week each week you will get to come help come help miss charles on friday excellent and i will know that you re doing a great job because you can ask miss butler my grandma and me that s right okay and over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what s your reward i get to go to hot wheels awesome and then although you re the one in charge of this goal there s a lot of people on your team who are those people on your team from home my mama my granny my sister my uncle tj and my aunty people on you re side all right and then when you re here at school who s on your team miss charles miss butler miss ficker awesome all right so what do you think how s the school going to go it s going to be great because i will follow all of these good and i m here to help okay all right well i think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we manage our time really well and i know we talked a little bit before about kind of your month we looked at the month of february and figured out what big things you have coming up what portions of the day you spend here at school or at church and what you do how you help out taking care of your niece so that s the month of february so what we re going to do today is really focus on this week and make a plan so what i ve done here is based on the information you told me before we ve got this week starting with today monday february 7th and you will notice i ve the time of day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till yeah 10 at night so i have these spaces blocked off so what are you usually doing monday wednesday friday from 7 to 4 come to school you re at school right so this whole area is school is school that s right you re here at school will you write school sure sometimes it s easy for me if i just draw a line to show that like that okay school okay so knowing that you re in school from 7 to about 4 o clock and we also need to think about some other regular things that you do during the week so you told me before that,1.0
i think that igneous and metamorphic they re the least there are two books that don t use em cause they re well my igneous yeah it igneous and metamorphic cool off and react and only a few particles came off but i was yeah it s just awkward because mine was boosting most of yours well yeah when i did my alien on my first try it was 42 grade then now when i m measuring it again it was 22 grade it mine never changed all it did was lost a little bit of it s rice crispies that was mine but i feel like igneous rock like 20 well yeah cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock s outside and mine was the same as igneous and metamorphic and so if i d shake it like through weathering a bunch of rock would fall off i haven t done anything yet it was three i can t wait to oh i have to say the one with the marshmallows cause it s well for my sedimentary it was harder yeah mine too what cause when i did mine only one piece of my sedimentary broke apart and the sedimentary my igneous rock it has like almost it might be a little inaccurate since these are not real sedimentary rocks you have to keep that in mind well yeah so but what if they were real sedimentary would we be able to tell what they are yeah obviously do you know any sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar yes i saw them in my yard they re called a granola ball no that was probably granite which is an igneous rock for jeanie do we write just how many lasts cause mine must ve had okay so when i when i did the blendering of my sedimentary i lost only three grams off of my sedimentary rock so i m not sure what would happen if i add these two because of the heat out of the cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue metamorphic rocks what would happen was the heat would melt it and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil yeah that s how that happens because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while yeah like last we and like have you ever heard of a rock that s called metamorphic rock yeah it can be greasy let s talk about why we use the models obviously you re never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that s like the taffy why did we use the laffy taffy for our model because the heat and the pressure the heat and the pressure would like stick together but like a sedimentary rock we use our fingers to add that heat pressure we had to simulate it somehow we couldn t do the actual earth process in the classroom do you agree with that mm hmm okay so you understand why you understand why we use that material for our model okay right it probably melts and why did we use the microwave for the igneous rock because what were we trying to simulate there from magma is a really hot substance and this is what igneous rocks can form from could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom no no could we work a marshmallow yep so we understand the connection there we re trying to use materials that we can bring into the classroom but that will still simulate lava magma the processes okay so pressure i think it has less effect of all the it had a lesser effect going through the processes of of both weathering and erosion and erosion okay now you guys can think about this if you didn t like the samples and examples up here that i used you could always do it different food material to make up your own experiment later okay let s talk for a moment why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion why are we measuring again look at your rock samples do they look the same as what we measured in here no no what happened you have to measure the difference the difference and why would there be a difference what could we do to our rock samples changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them let s use the same what did you use when you pre measured i would keep it the same why would i keep it the same because it s can we compare centimeters to inches yes you can think about that because later when you have to come back and do the difference how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches how can you compare those two measurements you re telling me you wanna go centimeters here but inches down here i would keep it the same they would make it mathematically you working on your difference your difference in mass this your pre mass explain to me how you got to that where are the books they might add on to another sedimentary rock cause it s like never ending for some reason my sedimentary and my igneous rock they both lost a half inch in length yeah mine too in my igneous rock grams it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams mine lost no grams mine gained grams your gained grams yeah i had 17 grams i had 17 grams and then it came back to 21 and this one went up one because when this one went up three maybe you should check that over cause it weathers and erodes away well i m guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people s stuff went into mine and made it bigger cause it can do that it can see right there all around the oh i see it see other bits and pieces of other people s went into mine and made mine bigger with mine a bunch of bits and pieces and mine started to melt because your observations say it crumbles apart it s breaking apart and moving okay what about these gaps here these gaps yeah how you gonna do that for some reason my igneous rock into the sample it made it bigger made it heavier did it have more mass after the your protective sleeve s coming off that s a good possibility that might throw your measurements off did it happen to anything else any other sample now you re working on a difference in you gotta find the difference in length and width and you re gonna find the difference in mass that s interesting you could explain that away right there mm hmm isn t that the one igneous the one you were saying got the strange results you can talk to me then well that s probably how they make the canyons bigger maybe because some of the rocks after rain and the sandstorms they could just pound together and make a big old rock so okay so if it erodes off another rock i m listening are you talking about real life rocks when they really erode away mmhmm and it starts to rain cause a lot of times it s like wind and rain a lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain with the rain and here s another rock which makes a bigger you re thinking sometimes with real life rocks you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks right do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock okay so that would also cause reason for your measurements i like where you re going with that try to make that connection you know unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how metamorphic rock s not made of laffy taffy so how s this go back to rocks in real life think about that some of our videos that we were watching about what salts quartz in these two processes you have to let the water go down cause the heat inside of it could ve frozen cause they heat over there we had it kinda whoa what s the answer 19 grams 19 igneous igneous how could you make that explain it to your little sister she s not gonna be able to understand that she wasn t here what could you put on your rock cycle diagram okay so you re gonna have this is 17 17 for what igneous what about sedimentary tell me how sean needs help um he needs help with okay where he s trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock what do ya mean no i was saying that it may have gotten darker darker because of the heat yeah a lot of rocks do that yeah but it could be jus the pink yeah it could be i could write down that it could be pink yeah what happened to my metamorphic rock is i can yeah that s because of this thing in between our finger and mine it didn t get darker than mine though so you could add that to what you put in so how would that affect our measurements how did it affect your width igneous and sedimentary rock could now talk to me though if it s in you wanna know why those are there because a lot of rocks don t have protection that doesn t help them and a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag which mixed with the sedimentary it could and sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around guess what it would do it would also become a sedimentary it s just like the rocks it s just like the rocks in life it s more similar to real life yeah the eroded bits would stick to other rocks so i just added like bits we have bits and pieces see if i was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this this would also become this because this isn t on the mat this would begin to stick and when you ball it together it makes it appear coloring to it that show that it s inside there i think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock after each sample ones that were weathering and erosion so you re gonna compare your two measurements pre measurement post measurement to see if there s a difference for each rock hmm hmm do we have to subtract do we what s your key word that could tell you what to do difference go show me i know you re thinking you just told me what key word tells you what to do where were we finding the mass after we ve done the weathering and erosion okay are you gonna get started yes yes jack are you finished with that scale can we use manners please can we use manners can you say please pass the balance talk to me guys just for a moment about the differences in those in your we ve got ashley s igneous we talked about that i figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen because they put the sedimentary came on to the metamorphic so we can see again how just and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag that s how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock and i think it became darker because the heat because of the pink and because of the pink yeah okay think about in real life sedimentary rock when those levels when those layers are smashed together okay don t some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure okay that was your metamorphic yes brooke and also you get the igneous in there it sticks to it and you can just put it inside there cover the layers off and it actually gets inside the metamorphic so you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks and how they could combine with one another and result in a completely different rock okay so on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome not the candy rock cycle the real one it says that you could use a diagram okay using your textbook level readers science journal or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle okay my igneous has gone down just a bit,1.0
who s gonna do the skyscraper so we got to put size color and shape size color and shape ok i m gonna do a skyscraper beau is that for the past or the present that s for the present skyscraper present the present the present ok and the pyramid is for the past yeah and you ll do a pyramid for the past i was gonna do a log cabin that s what i was gonna do but we have to use different things because we don t got no logs well actually they still make log cabins now we can use brown for the logs jonathon says they still make log cabins now they do yeah they do we don t really make pyramids any more do we no yeah but they could be hidden in egypt yeah but there is four lines what we gonna do with the other two what i want you to do is list three details color size and shape so what shape will your skyscraper probably be a rectangle a rectangular prism a rectangular prism that s what dillon said rectangle rectangular prism okay then you can talk about your pyramids ask them they re your team a square pyramid triangle oh he said a square pyramid yeah let s do it a triangle you think it should be a triangular pyramid yeah i m with dillon well talk about it which one do you want to do i thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid you know because it has four sides it does have four a pyramid only has four sides well a triangle has four too it does one two three four that s a square honey because it has four well if it has three sides how many sides does it have three three so you have to decide so we could take a square and make it like a dillon agrees a square pyramid too i love having y all together let s do square pyramid and rectangular prism good deciding alright what are you guys discussing right now we re discussing what all we wanna do i like that okay we re not sure what play we re doing you re not sure what play you wanna do because everybody keeps picking everything so how are we gonna figure it out but i agree with randy so what do you guys agree on i agree with my plans he wants like an old time car and i don t agree with that but we don t understand how you do an old time car how do you do a play or skit about an old car that s what you need to tell them the only time okay aaron said something about the classroom and that i was going to be the teacher or something like that i wanna be assistant teacher randy likes that and this is two people from the past and two people from the present hear what jacob said jacob wants to be assistant teacher you re the teacher assistant teacher so when will that be in the past or the present present haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too and then we ll come to where they are then they ll have to show us what changed did y all hear aaron s idea you can say that to them i like aaron s idea listen to what aaron just said guys he has an idea that you may want to do ian and jacob and haley are from the present and me and randy are from the past and we come and they show us all the stuff that has changed i agree with aaron i agree with aaron i agree with aaron or we could do like you two are teachers and like me and aaron and ian are like students and then them two teach us oh that s an idea you could do but then how do we do the past well but you could do the past and then how could you do a skit about the past and a skit about the present yeah they would be the same except one is the past and one is the present to where like no one had desks and then in the present we have desks oh what do you think ian i wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future well are we doing the future or the present present well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present okay well decide it sounds like you got some really good ideas why can t we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present and you choose your own people who live in the present well ian if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea yeah you choose your own people but you do it in the present sounds like y all have to just keep on you may just have to make a decision ok you may just have to make a decision sounds like you are doing great guys how do you spell transfer trucks huh how do you spell transfer trucks transfer trucks let s sound it let s tap it what letters t trrr a n c e r or something trr like tree t r you got it shannon did you hear shannon let s tap it ta jarius trr aaa a what letter is that nnnn n ssss c k s ssss transssss s i got s f f how do you make er at the end of a word e r you got it there you go and you know trucks so what are y all doing with transfer trucks i don t know he s the one who wanted to write it why was this on noah s desk case has some names yeah ok but what but why did y all um you re describing what each persons job will be and i have that noah and ta jarius and madison are gonna do what the waves what kind of waves what are y all showing from the past and the present i wanna do waves in the present do waves change from the past to the present do you mean like ocean waves have those changed over time i m doing transfer trucks what s it suppose to be a i m doing transfer trucks how have those changed over time horses carried them with like umbrella s over them very cool and we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier and you said that was like a truck you could pull that up back up there i could pull it back up do you wanna see that again cash do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time shannon what are you doing what are your illustrations gonna be showing change over time she might do cars or something do you wanna do cars you don t have to do cars you don t want to lots of things have changed over time you can actually buy food and not hunt it how do you spell shannon that s one of the things you could draw the change from the maybe you ll do washing machines yeah yeah that works yeah cars change do you wanna do transfer trucks no you re already doing them guys do you wanna do washing machines madison draw a washing machine next to that you wanna do washing machines can you hold that up so they can see it because shannon can t see it where did ya wash your clothes at turn it over like this and you d rub them against here different isn t it yeah when i was little my great great great great great great great grandma grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when i was big i was allowed to see it very cool there was a picture alright it sounds like you ve got some work to do guys i love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time i think we need to think about waves though because waves are a natural thing people don t really build and change those do we no so we need to think about something that has changed over time and don t forget our books buildings buildings buildings have definitely changed over time alright guys keep it up you are doing great alright let s see what you guys are up to okay what s going on over here well we re thinking about about cassa coloring ann coloring and me coloring and drawing and her drawing i love drawing you love drawing that s what i love i love typing at home i love all of it very cool alright so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing we re gonna show the style the color okay can you tell me what you re gonna draw we re gonna draw dresses oh dresses and shoes like dresses and the shoes that they would wear i can get my old dress my mom s old dress she s got i have it and i can design it you can uh huh so are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present yes or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present we re gonna do it all together i love that them two are coloring i m coloring and me and her are drawing very nice you re drawing yes we re drawing i m coloring very very nice well it looks like you guys are ready for your next page let me ask you this how has clothing changed over time the color has definitely changed the colors have changed and the shoes ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses oh so they used to wear really long dresses and now they have short dresses that come up to here yeah and shoes they wear lace up boots laced up boots i think my mama has them i won t be able to wear them but i might be able to bring them oh that d be cool if you bring those it sounds like you have great ideas and they wore hats back then cause i m thinking about my mom s dress i mean i can design it i am very very pleased with how much you ve accomplished together in your group let me get you the next sheet okay we all have our things done and we re going to get it and we all have each others phone numbers here s the next sheet let s look for a second who will design the piece from the past and who will design the piece from the present now that doesn t mean it has to be separate right you can take it home well me and her well it sounded like we re all okay yeah we re all basically doing it okay why is this change important to people today and how could this continue to change in the future hmmmm there s some questions to think about so have you worked on this some more you ve decided to what you re gonna do skyscrapers and pyramids they re doing the pyramids me and him is doing the skyscrapers them two are doing the pyramids we re doing the skyscrapers that was nice good going coming up with that good job we re doing a square pyramid you re doing a square pyramid yeah that s easy all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top so when i was with you before you said this is hard we don t know what we re gonna do and all had different ideas and as it turns out this is kind of easy what made it easier working as a team working as a team dillon would you mind sitting over here sweetie so that everybody can hear and see what you re doing yeah kinda off by himself over there huh sweetheart alright the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is how has this changed over time buildings how have buildings changed over time pyramids pyramids been tooken down did we ever build buildings out of gold no i got something pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in eygpt like more land okay what about buildings in general how is this building different from mcwilliams it s bigger it s bigger and has more space which one is bigger mcwilliams and it s newer it s newer so how do you it s newer or it s smaller he says it s newer,1.0
that one hurts it says volume by use the formula to find the volume okay so i got 53 when i added up the numbers yeah i did too i took it and divided by three 17 6666 just do 17 6 no 17 point three sixes so we ll just just no hayden we have to find 17 666 cause all six of them put 17 6 i know but we are now let s just round it up one to 18 okay yeah so with average it s 18 okay so now we have to do based on our average how close were you to your guess so how close were we to our guesses so like i was close by seven i was close by nine we have 18 here how far was nine and 18 i don t know nine nine plus nine is 18 right oh yeah so write nine right here i was by five okay all right based on our average how many drops would it take to make one liter 18 000 what oh yeah you got us correct a few times multiply it by if we had it to drops times 1000 cause that s how many milliliters are in a liter we get 10 000 okay so now we do water disposal follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid so first we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter so we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this so giselle you wanna do that no okay that yeah pour it so this gets to 20 okay i ll pour it then oops whoa okay try not to put too much i ll pour it out let s try again it with a dropper no you re supposed to do it with a beaker i know but if we re really really close and we can t do it with a beaker then we re gonna have to do it with a dropper so we just do this okay we re at 20 i think that s 20 we re at 19 i got it okay just don t drop it too fast cause i okay okay so now we have to add the three marbles so we ll bring em on this side yeah you have one hayden has one and i have one no let alina have one you do alina poured the water so it s you amy and hayden okay okay so we have to like tilt it to roll down the cylinder i think i can do it yeah i know but it s the easiest way no not that much you don t wanna don t wanna pour some out sayonara sucker okay the water level now is 26 exactly all right so it went from 20 to 26 so the difference in volume is six and the volume of the three marbles is six right what do you think alina yeah how do you think i got six i don t know well subtracted 20 from 26 because it s 20 before the marbles and 26 after so the marbles must be okay kay how we doin over here pretty good all right i m gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume what have you learned about volume so far whenever you alina look at the board that i made for you okay whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder what s happening to the volume what happened what happened to the volume of the water it was at 20 and then 26 it got higher it went higher it went higher okay so we can say then that volume does what what did it do rise it rose okay volume rises okay so the volume rose good and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement did you get that far yet yep okay we got six because the water was at 20 before and then after we put the marbles in it was at 26 so it s six cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20 good okay if you can switch places with me i wanna be able to hear alina okay all right so i m gonna ask you another question when you were doing if you got six if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have we need to change that to a solid measurement okay this is the solid measurement cubes that we use to measure solids marbles are solids so alina can you can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes to centimeter cubes each one of those is a gram and if each one of these is a gram that s correct and if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed and all and in that case it must also be equal to one gram so that s why for this i wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams i could also figure out that these are our three marbles and we have six grams then each one of them is 15 grams okay but grams is that a unit of volume or is that a unit of mass mass mass good alina it s a unit of mass so what hayden said is correct one centimeter one milliliter is equal to one gram one milliliter of water is equal to one gram but what do we know about the cubic centimeters we need to put the units in this term so if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles then how can we change it to centimeters cubed how many milliliters is this is one centimeter cubed do you remember one it s a one to one ratio like eli told us in home room so six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed so and this is the unit of volume but you re also right the mass must be it will also be equal to one gram but we re talking about volume not mass so it s the weight it s the volume yeah it has to do with three times three times four but you have to explain why because so how do we know this but why do we do that you don t know the answer right now because it said that three cubic centimeters and a height of three cubic centimeters i don t know if that s really a three with a height of four yeah with a height of four so we have to do our work cause we built the work right there and like height from a and the height hold on so so summer three times three and then yeah times four i m up to three times three that s nine and then times four gives you three times when i did this it was four times three i know that is so three times 16 no three times three is nine times four is okay it s three times four okay it s nine times four why would that be 60 36 yeah so we did three times three we calculated nine times three so that gives you nine and then because there s a height of three you multiply by four which gives you 36 because it s a basic math problem and it gives you 36 okay so explain why you know that and then and then we go on to number two but wait for her to finish i am i m just gonna be a little change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try and it and explain of course not because we re gonna feel like i think is something s wrong well we can well i guess if no we can t cause you can take that one off the building height no we could tip this over this way and solve for why would you do that what we re done with problem one so now so i guess we could yeah but no but in we d still have we would still have the same volume all right so the next problem is can you change summer are you still i m fine i know but we already read it though she can read she needs to read it ryan so what say we couldn t because the numbers we ll have to do the oh wait no no we could no because like we won t we re doing the height and we turn it sideways yes we would it s true okay so so how are you guys doing for number two we wanted to we had it like this and we wanted to turn it sideways cause that would change the height around okay so let s talk about number two that s the one you re on i m completely knocked it over all right so the question is on number two can you change the length width can you change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try it and explain okay so first of all the first rectangular prism you built so this rectangular prism okay was one centimeter i mean three centimeters long we did three times three it was nine because it had a line so three times three is nine then times four times height of four i don t know okay so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one correct okay and then you just multiply its length times its width times its height and what did you get summer i got 36 36 and i m thinking that more than one thing can equal 36 like if we had okay so how many cubes did you use to get this two for 36 this 36 how many cubes were there in all in all that was 36 it was 36 you had to count out the cubes right so can you use the same but have like a different height but have a different length width and height well yeah the answer would be yes because more there are multiple pieces you could do six like well you do two three and six okay two times three equals six six times six equals 36 two times three times six would equal 36 right as long as the three would be height so six could be this okay summer what do you think they think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes could you still use 36 cubes build a rectangular prism and but get different numbers here you can why do you think so because it has to change it from then like the 36 would still be the same,1.0
anything else so what composter would you want i think we would want maybe like a three tray or four tray vermicomposter and i do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper maybe you guys have a different idea maybe i was thinking that maybe we can make one because i printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter so again that would save us a lot of money just to make it like this might cost 20 to get all these supplies and i know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this and this might cost 20 when a store bought one off the internet may cost 100 yes but the store bought one s are quality and a professional makes it so they know what they re doing i doesn t really matter i mean it has the same purpose it does the same thing i just matters on the worms the only thing that we really have to buy is the worms dylan and ben i got to admit i do agree with claire buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about i know it says what do we know about now where are you guys in your conversation we re deciding to do wood metal or plastic but he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust it could rust because of the moistness of the compost okay it s not metal we re not talking about metal so we might do plastic on what if we make it purchasing one no if we make our own but this one is award winning seventy dollars all right and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class this is buying a vermicomposter that would cost 70 and what did you say about yours this is about like 20 because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes and we need two of them and it says the cost is about five dollars each and that would save us a lot so we could get weebly pro tools and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags so what are your thoughts on helping the whole community i think we should build this because it s better and we would have more money left over and how would you spend the other money left over i would spend it on like stuff that we need for composting like for tools okay wait we have multiple conversations going here in this group so let s wait i would spend it on the tools weebly pro and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost and then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out and that way you could get more money and then we could get something else what s weebly pro it s like an extra you can search it up on google isn t it a website it s 26 compost and then you can have a many slides as you want videos and then we can sell our compost on the internet and that would help a lot so how is the weebly pro better than the weebly that we already have because you were the webmaster on the class website on the composting website and you want to what do you want us to do we can have buy the six month plan and then the guys for next year they figure it out and how would us buying the weebly pro help the community it would help us to sell it and to inform about compost okay any other comments or thought we could it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own okay inform who be more specific the viewers of the website all of our guests yeah there s a greater chance it s not gonna fail guys we re not playing the what if game i not saying but we have a chance that the cups might break because they re cups and they have an easier chance it has a bigger chance of not failing we have to take risks we have to plus you would have the pride of making your own if we make our own and we mess up then we re just wasting money what if what if what if what it i m not doing the what if cause remember last time when we built a if you make it there is a greater chance you will fail maybe instead of cups we use pvc pipes i mean they re that cheap and i mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups shhh too many people that s better quality i do agree with you adam but i also do agree with dylan and ben on two different subjects guys why don t we just make everything we can make the compost bin but if we make everything reusable bags why don t we buy the vermicomposter and then we make the bags the reusable bags are more like for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag and then the tools we might really need later on when we don t need the reusable bags we might need the tools or we said we might need to go buy this now and it might be too late already what s the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags jessica what s the major difference between the two in vermicomposting it keeps reproducing there s three products while the reusable bags when you sell them once and that s all you get from that bag and with the vermicomposter it keeps going it s very unlikely almost impossible that all the worms are going to die in one night plus why would you buy the bags if you can make them cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags like walmart and target bags and she melts them down and puts them into a bag why don t we buy the vermicomposter so it s a better quality and we make the bags they re easier it s very hard to find a perfect vermicomposter that s plastic and won t break most of them are terracotta and they ll shatter if somebody knocks it over it s also wood and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad how do you know we re going to do wood compost things on the internet are using either terracotta or wood terracotta shatters really easily okay so we need to do more research on this i found a four tray bin that s plastic for 89 99 but still why would we pay 100 when we can pay for quality a mere 20 i know but the materials we use aren t made for composting listen to carly for a second what carly because if we do what ben s mom s friend can do you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter do you think you could get your mom s friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does i think we should buy the vermicomposter first like buy it or make it and then buy the reusable bags so just like ben s mom s friend s bags but we should make them both because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools like a new aerator if we make the reusable bags we won t get to put our symbol on it which i think is part of the bag we re thinking about doing ovens cause it s like one two three four five six if we made it we wouldn t have a guarantee that it would work because we could screw up the way we make it or we could just mess it up in general but if we bought one it would be kind of guaranteed to work but sometimes we miss a part or a tool that we need to put it together how do you know that sometimes what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren t always there because when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools so we couldn t do one part of it and then it just all got all messed up it just threw us off so from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something we don t always get it this part is the leading thing right there it comes built all we have to do it put the plastic bars together and it will be kind of easy cause it just like goes yeah and you can work as a group to make it because it s like those styrofoams where you pull it together and you can just see where it s put together the sticks like the couplers on the sides so we have something to be proud of that we made everybody said that we wanted a see through one so we could actually see the dirt and this one s not see through so if we made our own could we get a clear tote cause the worms don t like light so you can lift to look and the worms don t like light so when you look at it lift it up look at it and then put it back down that s a good idea no one else has thought about that christian and how do you know that the worms don t like light because we looked it up on the internet and then one time i was in my house and i saw a worm out in the street and it was kind of like rattling rattling in the sun so then my sister kicked it in back in the grass so then it was much happier and i re research that okay but do we have to do vermicompost no we don t have to do it at all it s going to be our class we need to vote on what s going to be the best for the community what about reusable bags i think the reusable bags are and why how is the reusable bags different than what we re already doing if we sell the if the people next year sell them at the holiday boutique then if we sell compost then it would be the same customers and if we give the customer something different more people will come because they ll yeah and they need bags they could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy and for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag they could use the reusable bag i have an idea i think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler and then we should get the bags and we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea and then they could buy the bags and they could buy the compost and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it s not that hard so we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost yeah that s what i was thinking it s gonna cost extra and then make it just a bit more expensive cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost you know if you put your money in the bank they give you money this would basically give you money because you can make the compost yeah the interest yeah so we can get the money from this and then we can buy the bags for the high level tea but that has no holes for the worms the sun is coming right into but would it fit in our room so we need to get more information on this remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size yeah but normally they don t do false advertisement this is like in a this the bottom is like this size of a desk you could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in it s like a shower it s like the size of a shower yeah you guys need more information we need more information before you can make a decision on that a lot of information on this already but we won t make tea if this one would have really worked cause it s made you know the more it costs the better it works do you agree with his comment no yeah that s what cara said can anyone give an example i don t agree with that because when i was real little i bought some toy cars and they didn t work as well as i got some that were cheaper and the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones okay you guys continue discussing that,1.0
okay what s the next one zach jen you can put on a 50 line poem on that one here if you wanted to i got that you have okay what was the main what was the summary what would be a good summary sentence well they competed in a game known as the memoriad uh huh you guys had that one don t you you have the names and faces there that was great the game are you doing the vocab though no okay so wait hang on should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words you can just do anything from that article the pictures were just to get you thinking about it that s why we did the words and the vocab was just to help us understand so it doesn t have to go off the vocab but the vocab kind of connects with an idea so it may kind of work out that way you ll have to let zach see because you took what he had which is great and you added to it do we put the name of the movie i m doing it s a song the croak part is a song mm hmm that was part of the okay i was getting there there s the song i was stuck on the reading one too got one left zach what s the text structure sharpening his pencil just go like that so was the puppet in 1970 or was it yep 1970 that must have been old 1968 is when the yellow submarine came out yep all right do you guys want to put your pyramid up there zach do you want to help do that do you agree that he was right on the text structure yeah see if you can build it i tried to size it just about right as close as i could get so it should fit in there pretty good i don t think it s sized up very well what i just got it as close as i could zach it may not be 100 perfect and then the person that didn t read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers that means we got to do another one you each got a chance to read yeah that s the tone one we need one more detail did i make it a little too big or is it pretty close it s a little long could be a little long huh had a little extra at the bottom next time i ll shrink it up just a little bit we still have one more that s fine and who read it was it zach we ll let zach read those when the girls get done okay do i read the summary do you just want me to read i don t know if he knows start with the details memoriad is an unforgettable competition memoriad games is memorize 50 line poems people compete in the games called memoriad the game is to memorize it memorize names and faces and memorize a 50 line poem very good and what was your text structure description description because they were describing all about he just talked he did the talking you did the writing somebody gave you ideas kinda maybe it was a good partnership the girls are just about done we ll let them read theirs and then we ll do our jeopardy can we tape the jeopardy game mm hmm yep we have the same people in jeopardy that were in here yes it is the same group okay let s not have a sword fight right now she has one more task there she s got it all grammatically correct okay let s just judy over here do you mind if it s off to the side there s another one there s two of them oh did it fall off well we can put a little piece of tape over it oh here it is there you go that should hold it up good all right see if you agree with what the girls have here are you listening zach got a pyramid all set up our text structure is wait do i start at the bottom start at the bottom and the details kind of add to the summary the movie they were talking about was the yellow submarine starring is it starring or staring starring i bet starring the beatles the beatles okay their song called being green was made in 1970 summary the television was made in 1953 kermit was in 1970 stoplight was made in 1920 they all had one thing in common they were in a color very good i love that last sentence they all have that in common they re in color text structure is sequence sequence because it tells the order of them all the years very good okay one of you guys go grab a marker board one from each team and i ll go get jeopardy and you ll need a marker to write on the marker board i will pull the screen down all right zach zach where are the markers you can grab one back there there s one up here as long as you got one or two for your group you can take turns now these questions i think will flow pretty well today whoa i can t even see it i think the yellow is better i know with the lights on it s a little harder but it helps to have the lights on did we run review what did we run review text structure my music didn t come on confucius says vocab text features features thank you zach yes they re different confucius says yeah okay who started first last time was it the guys yeah okay we ll let the gals start today so do i do text structure oh you re gonna win text structure 500 text structure 500 yeah what s the confucius says we had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit they were little sayings and you decide just which text structure they go with so that might go with text structure yes it ll be a text structure question yeah is that what you guys wanted was text structure right yeah okay in our state dams have been built zach on many rivers these dams are used to product electricity we need but they also create problems scoot your chair closer to your partner scoot your chair back prevents the other wildlife near the rivers therefore we should not build any more dams instead we should use solar energy or energy from the sun to produce electricity this will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us hmm which of the five text structures we think it s problem solution problem solution correct give yourself 500 points because it said problem in there all right what would the guys like hey sorry zach what do you want they did text structure 500 it ll pop up yellow after i click on the next one vocab for 500 vocab for 500 want to read that one zach you should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response hmm what does ponder mean you think ahh perfect to think about give yourself 500 points all right what would the gals like should we try the confucius question yeah for 500 okay confucius says for 500 and marissa can read this one confucius says a beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes this is one of the five text structures description yeah description description very good and i ll just set these out i got something that might help you guys since a lot of these have them you just kind of have your choices right there what would the guys like very good text features text features 500 text features 500 which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects people and places you find in a book index table of contents title what do you guys think alphabetical listing what do you think zach index index index would be correct good job guys what would the gals like oh 500 yeah i just did that 500 should we text features for 400 400 okay all right judy can read this one what text feature gives definition for vocabulary words wait what is it wait yeah what do you mean for that oh i didn t that one doesn t have the choices like the other one did it would be an index a glossary or a title glossary glossary is correct i put the choices on the other ones i just must have missed that one very good all right confucius says for 400 confucius says for 400 could you go for mrs lloyd s for just a couple minutes okay i wanna go tell mr debush that s all right i ll just get you guys a pass here in just a second we ll do a couple more questions here all right whose turn to read it s zach s zach s turn okay confucius say first feed the lion then enter cage hmm sequence sequence do you agree with him yeah yes very good sequence all right what would the gals like what one did they do they just did the confucius says for 400 i want to do that one for 400 or for 300 right i think yeah confucius says 300 okay yeah okay all right oh man basketball whose turn to read confucius says net in soccer is much larger than net in basketball compare and yeah compare and contrast very good all right so they did this one zach what would you guys like you want to do vocab for 400 vocab for 400 yeah vocab vocab for 400 okay many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs very good just a second what do you think first players okay the first players you re exactly right oh my gosh people who have done something for the first time and they don t get paid they re amateurs all right what would the gals like they did vocab structure yeah structure 400 yeah they want the big point ones is it my turn yeah i think so living in the country is very different than living in the city a city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people in the country there are fewer cars and people in the city many people can walk to the movies stores and other activities in the country people must drive to get to places compare and contrast yeah compare and contrast and she agrees very good all right what would the guys like what do you want zach vocab for 300 vocab for 300 oh it s your turn zach i depleted my savings when i bought my new basketball shoes what do you think hmm what do you think one for depleted oh i know this one drained drained yep empty gone you used all your savings and basketball shoes can cost a lot of money so i can see that happening what would the gals like confucius oh wait no no no did they do text structure 300 nope he just did the vocab okay i want to do text structure for 300 features for 300 no text structure oh text structure i can go back structure for 300 the eye is made up of many parts the white part of the eye is called the sclera sclera and the colored part is called the iris the iris comes in many colors including brown blue green and hazel the iris is covered with the cornea which is clear and round description do you agree yeah i should know about the eye because my stepmom s a she works at the eye company wait did we just pass text features oh she does they just,1.0
hello guys after all the hard work you ve put in on doing your presentations and your tri board and all the really cool stuff you ve done now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you ve done all this research for okay so first off doing a little poll which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use solar energy why it looks pretty cool and i don t know it seems like the most efficient way because the sun s always there and the sun won t run out that s the word whenever you re done using it you can sell it you can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night you can sell it okay so he thinks solar who else okay go ahead i like the wind oh so you can talk to him because you want to be able to talk to each other right i liked the wind one because it stored up the battery and the battery whenever it wasn t windy and so it kind of was always there it didn t matter about the wind yeah you can answer the question i also think that wind s the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind you can also make money off of that so maybe if you get it in enough homes you won t even have to have a job you can make money off that that s a very good point that s a very good point making money off of that energy source which other ones did we say could make money um the solar solar can make money well i like the wind because it s like the sun is going to burn up one day but the wind is always going to be there and the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die but that s okay okay well what are some pros and cons then so you just said birds would die if we use wind power okay does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power i think birds dying isn t that bad because you know we eat birds so i don t think it would be that bad if birds do die i mean i don t think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy not as much as oil or any of that other stuff yeah or like we eat birds the other one i like is the hydro one that james did because his was ridiculous that was nice so what part of it were you most impressed with like not like the demonstration but it was a great demonstration but hydroelectric power in general what part of that like how if you have a pond or something you can put it in there and then it will power up your whole house do we need moving water oh yeah you need moving water to have that you d have to have a stream but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water and if you really wanted to spend some money there s also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir so that one actually sounds pretty good so somebody want to defend theirs rakif i don t really like mine because which one did you do i did oil natural gas oil and natural gas okay why not because mine isn t as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy so it s probably going to run out pretty soon like oil natural gas and coal do run out they re not going to be as here as much as the wind or hydro or something like that well there s a lot of dangers involved with using oil right oil rigs pipelines lots of dangers involved right oil prices can cause high gas prices that s true too remember in your presentation you talk about some of the dangers what were those dangers and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources for oil yeah the pipelines can burst and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out they could cause another oil spill explosions but coal i know you re supposed to like stick up for your natural resource but i kind of think coal can be good but it s mostly bad because a lot of people s lives are getting killed because of all the gasses smells and being down there for so long and i think that s also very bad and the land it hurts the land and the environment coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it all the coal dust it can cause a lot of lung problems so the miners that go down there they re risking their lives right yeah any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal no nuclear energy what nuclear energy is the worst okay what about nuclear energy how dangerous was that when you looked it up it s a six out of ten chance of what happening it depends it costs way too much first of all to build it it is very expensive that s true it s got a lot of risks like if it gets into your water or if you breathe in the radiation i imagine it could it smells bad okay does collecting oil use more energy than it provides good question what do you mean by collecting oil like if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil does it use more energy than it provides no i don t think so because in my presentation it said it produces like a widespread like a very large amount of energy and also that your wave and tidal power powers our system as you said in your presentation oh good point those two actually work together when you talk about the wave and tidal power that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling so that s a very good thing as well it s a benefit of drilling absolutely are there different energies that do benefit each other yes the solar energy and wind because the wind energy is based off the sun because of how the sun waves come onto the earth and then it turns this sun mill so it produces the turning of the mill so the sun and solar energy and wind energy the solar energy and the wind they actually work together because i ve seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top one then the other can go that s okay i think solar energy is a really good thing because for a lot of power plants like for times the condition of natural resources like wind even hydroelectric if there s a drought or something or not enough water flow you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant or anywhere right because we ve found that solar is pretty cost feasible right yeah it s not that expensive and actually you won t have to pay an electrical bill if you get that if you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something you re better off just using the solar panel it would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine or to have the solar panels power the turbine it doesn t power it it s just like another way to get energy at the same time that you re getting the wind when there s no wind there s not much of a wind that s what the battery s for hmm interesting i have a question for solar power too for solar power how can i make aluminum more efficient in the future well it doesn t use a lot of the gas so it doesn t affect the environment so it doesn t affect your breathing and you don t need solar panels like you don t need to turn stuff on during the day because the sun through the windows can give you light and then can store up for the night okay i have a question what natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future like 50 or so years from now wind it was used like 3 000 years ago so if it was used 3 000 years ago i think it would be used 3 000 years in the future that s not necessarily true because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes the problem with the wind thing is it can be used in country like rural areas because in other areas you can t put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood because you can t can you put one you mean i could put one outside the school here well it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school well i d put it on top of the school because then there would be more wind higher up right and we have to worry about spacing right because we were saying wind power is built usually where on wind farms where you have a lot of flat land because if you build in a mountainous region are you going to get a lot of the wind if it s high enough it ll probably be enough then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning or being damaged that way yeah that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down right that s very possible so when you think about one energy source is there really one energy source to go with or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live what s available because again talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water is there running water everywhere around the united states no no and what s the problem if you flood an area even if there is a running water what happens if you flood the area well they have to decide usually if it s going to be a major problem they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things that s mostly our united states rule but in china they really don t care so they flood three or four cities multiple towns fill up three gorges of water wow that s just insane because once you disrupt water flow you have a problem so again there are some pros and cons to these okay we re going to take a second and we re going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use so if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with whether there was running water think you have those things beside you don t limit yourself there but turn to your neighbor for a minute and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2 because each one of you might have a different opinion give each other a little bit of a reason why and we ll get back together in just a second alright guys another 30 seconds then we ll get back together alright three two one let s wrap up our conversations alright how many people by show of hands went with one of the non renewable resources like coal oil or natural gas cool so everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go alright ryan i think it s either wind or solar power how many people agree oh so wind or solar is the clear choice jonah why the thing is i think solar would be first because solar energy you can use almost anywhere pretty much but the wind if you live here you can t get it as easily because there s not as much wind so it would be a lot easier to have solar because you can use solar anywhere because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere we think solar too because the sun is always there even if it is winter or it s a little cloudy the sun is still there yeah but what about at night time so maddy what did we find out about solar at night time like a lot of people go to work during the day so no one s at their house using their lights and stuff so there s a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house you still get some light at night bouncing off the moon dustin what do you think i was thinking that solar energy would be great because i was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone and you have it plugged in and while it s plugged in it s fully charged and you can still use it and it won t un charge because it s still plugged into the wall but if the power goes out at your house then it will stop charging and you ll have that much battery left so it s kind of like if you re out in the day and your house is charging while there s still sun so you re still getting energy and at night time when the sun is gone you ll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing well it s the same thing with wind power you d still have that battery there yeah wind power would be would solar power still work during a storm it depends how severe the storm is so you mean this is like built to last yeah if it gets struck by lightning i don t think it would still work but you know when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds right so that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day just at night you would still have to use the battery that s been stored just like with wind power there is wind power all day long all night long but sometimes it does die down at certain times so there s a battery too there as well exactly i agree with solar power but i agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things but i don t see the purpose of a solar farm it takes up a lot of land just the point to collect the sun i think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant like wind power or something like that because and cost wise it would be probably expensive because it was 900 for just one of those panels and miss shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house that s basically about 10 800 for one house but we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines just imagine random winter lines in your front yard yeah but we saw pictures or a video of a solar powered house and most people don t like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house same with the wind power wind turbines would look unattractive but you can still decorate them if you want you can t really do that with the wind power i mean solar power thing because it s mostly black that s a good thought so going forward thinking of an energy solution because as you guys get older energy is going to be something you have to worry about we ve seen the gas prices the gasoline prices for regular cars go up you ve seen the ethanol being developed is it good to keep developing new technologies how many of you guys once you start driving think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you would drive a hybrid car i would okay would you drive a hybrid car yeah i would drive one because it s more in miles per gallon and with rechargeable cars you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money that s good also the emissions from your gas,1.0
oh water or more i guess and what gets thrown into the pond the pebble is there a pebble oh that s so cute okay so wait what order these do these rings show up what order yeah like what s the procedure when this was like like this and then this one or then this one they start small and bigger and bigger so drop your pebble in the pond there you go and it gets bigger as it goes up okay and so now maybe talk through maybe talk through what is the given what s the constant rate of change where you re looking for it and how would that be seen visually so the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second per second the adt is two pi r br the first which one are you guys on number one okay good in order for you to find for qr may define the adt we need to find the adt of different orbs what the adt concentrating with them so it s like four for dr okay so what did you do with your sand show me what happened here okay air is gonna come into the clear hole and then right into you picked the sand problem tell me about your sand problem it s talking about sand quality to a how to apply it at a rate to be permanent okay and out of the following the diameter of the base in it is it s going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot that s the idea and the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from okay so our cone has been smooshed but you see how it s still kinda narrow a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone right and what s the unknown what are we looking for here we re trying to find the rate of the height of the pile oh you can do it we said that s possible okay so kathy you re able would that be dvdt dhdt drdt all these dts we can kinda run together just blow it up can we do ahdt sure ahdt because you re looking for a rate of change for the height now you re actually on the hardest problem this is the trickiest problem and you have correctly chosen the cards for these but here s what makes it tricky i want you to read through this slowly and let s figure out the unknown and if they give us what other rates they give us now you actually just told me what the unknown is right dhdt dhdt okay what other variables do we have on this card besides dhdt and the rate of change ar ardt ardt and dvdt okay now you read it again while y all are listening and see if you can pick out maybe do dvdt or drdt what was that for both at a sand and gravel plant sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of plus what information did you just get you can say it again if you need to sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute okay good that s dvdt cause it s the amount the volume changes and the label kinda gets screwy too right okay so now we re listening for drdt we hope we hear drdt because we need that also right the diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude so okay so it s giving us information about radius compared to altitude but it doesn t seem to be giving us drdt right which means we don t have drdt and the radius is two feet and the radius is two feet so what s the height again it s the height of dt so we need to find how fast the radius is changing so this right here is the decision nice the dvdt equals four pi r squared to the drdt so this is the hardest when you get to the math what we need to find is drdt when the radius equals two feet okay all right okay i guess the next one we can figure out right now how many cubes we got three three okay all the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second how fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter we have you doing the edges of a cube the radius of an aired balloon so the radius one 370 370 370 so d ds over dt is three right plug that we can just plug that in cause it s not a constant tell me a little bit about the problem you re on does it have three cubes in your problem like why does it have three cubes in the box we started with that this other one okay and it shows after a second it would be that big and then after another second it would be that big oh good okay so it s showing that it s the same cube and it s getting bigger it s like three stages in an environment very good very good correct interpretation yes and it also shows the volume of the now what does this question ask you for at the very end what are you gonna be trying to find how fast the volume changes when it enters from yes i have a question for you here s a think about it question cause you re finding dvdt when it is exactly one centimeter right that s what the question s asking do you think dvdt would be greater or smaller when it s past one centimeter do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster or will it slow down slow down slow down slow down my challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with try two centimeters and see if you were right yeah so go above and beyond the question was your conjecture right or were you like oh no we were backwards kay okay the base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball at a descending rate and it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part oh you look great d two so okay let s pour the sand again so what five so it s pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute talking about the change in output so what s constant its cubic feet per minute so that s the the sand being poured in it so that s the volume i don t know okay we have choices as to who can t i have four and zero to bring it down yeah i m just gonna bring it down problem number what problem one okay next problem are we agreed a ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house the base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second how fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall so then you definitely got the demonstration item perfect that s right that s exactly what s happening all right okay you guys are gonna get this one it s what s supposed to be a length and what made you pick that one it s the pythagorean theorem and then why would you wanna use the pythagorean theorem because it s a three sided it s equal to the right triangle yeah exactly uh huh all right okay now i ve got a question for ya is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning okay good good all right what would that mean about your derivative card what would you know for sure if you put 25 right there get a constant rate of one foot per second anything special for this derivative card dz over dt equals well if the original if your ladder is 25 right here where would the 25 originally be put in the z in the z okay i that would say that x squared plus y squared equals 25 now take the derivative of this with respect to time would it look exactly like this or a little bit different one we re at a constant rate right and so when you do your math you can go ahead and put that as zero and then just work with those good that s good so what s the the balloon s increasing yeah following the radius it s the what s the radius it s four feet the radius yeah you have to find what the radius is at four feet and find the radius when it s at four feet which one are you on p two when the radius is four feet at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area so you would define the area wait which are you on okay so you have three balloons right and you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what okay okay the rate of change so if you have one balloon and put one back into it and then that s when you have okay let s see what they look like so let s see if we can have different stages of our balloon here you look like you must be at the last stage cause that looks pretty big okay that must be the beginning that looks like the beginning too can one of em get middle stage i think you ve got the baby balloon though i think that s the biggest that guy s getting i didn t know they were different sizes yeah they are actually different sizes one more do it and you let some out maybe you got it oh perfect okay tell me about what s going on with this balloon what s goin on oh increase four cubic feet and they oh what are they i think i m thinking of the wrong one like it s not like it s not measuring each breath it s something no you are thinking right this is is this like what we had two days ago yeah a couple days ago like is what was constant a couple days ago in our activity air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of yes so like the volume the rate of change of volume is constant is that true on this or is that a different problem okay and so what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out the change of the radius how the radius is and what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets it ll stretch out that i m sorry it ll slow down yeah i think that s a good conjecture that would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got sounds good and it is because it was what the volume cause the volume yeah f four for that that ll go on the left f four and d six have you gotten to the balloon part yet let s talk about the other one okay one okay the other balloon problem was about surface area is that right have you done this one yet yes okay how many blow up the balloon and let s see what s happening in that balloon kevin what was happening on this balloon it s the rate of the the puddle b a formula problem okay so how is jesse gonna show us the surface area of dvdt okay so let s demo that causing ripples thank you nice demonstration what is constant on this problem the area and then yeah the radius,1.0
how do you know how do you think it might be different okay maybe ethan goes here measure yours and let s see and which one do you think you re going under i don t know okay all right okay well you all listen to him listen to him you all talk about it you talk to them i m gonna walk around it s my turn ej okay let him do the writing why are you taking them out of that one okay and what are you trying to make it do balance okay balance let s see you trying to make it balance okay we need to put it right there okay did you balance it now okay so what do put in that point i m going to scoot this just a little it and then you write it down good how did you know it was balanced good you said which one was heavier here okay why did you say think you can do that one how did you know it was balanced is it balanced what about that at first which one was balanced because why it was heavy okay okay so how many of those are i think it was one more okay you re put it in you ll put what in this one and the number of crayons you all used you had another object that was moving look right here you think their eraser didn t move what you all gonna test next did you even measure that one and i ll come back alright what are you all doing here do you think if you did the scissors and matthew did the scissors do you think it would measure the same let s do it okay let s do it one at a time what s happening you guys can t measure try this one here s my question if matthew blows the paper clip is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip what do you think you don t think so why not matthew you blow okay all right so remember that okay now weslee i want you to test it you said you thought it would go different see if you can make a difference yeah why did it do something different what s that that you re blowing out air air and what is it gas gas good all right you all can go ahead and finish measuring i saw ella trying now if you and ella both try to blow on that do you think it s going to move why don t you think it s going to move you think it s too heavy and you don t have enough breath try it and see see if you all both do it if you can get it to move you re going red in the face and it s going away did you all think it was going to move you all didn t think it was how did you find this what d you do counted okay counted and what are you working on right now the colors okay which one do you have to count now which one do you have there this one and what is that one what is that one a solid a liquid or the gas solid a solid how are you going to find out what are you gonna do look at this you re going to look at those can you count those i m gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph okay you re doing good okay okay can you come over here and count you might have to get out of your chair you have lots of them one two three four five six seven eight eight five six seven eight check your numbers and you checked to make sure all right whatcha going to do now tally tally them okay think you all can do that okay you need help putting it on remember which one is the total how did you know that so quick i heard you started counting and then what did you do you found it quickly you remembered from that okay how else could have known that fast go down there go down there okay good,1.0
