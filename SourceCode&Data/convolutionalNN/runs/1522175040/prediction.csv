so you can t count it out completely hmm so we have three things going on here i hear exponential decay i hear an upside down parabola and i hear a negative sloping line red why don t you chime in i haven t heard from you are you going with decay are you going with decreasing line you going with upside down parabola what had you guys decided we were going to go with decay but you were going to go with decay okay but i changed my mind because decay it keeps decreasing all the way but myspace it got to a point where it stopped decreasing and it was like what rosetta said so it stopped decreasing which is what you re saying and you re saying that s in agreement with rosetta i have a serious issue with a line stopping can somebody talk to me about that i have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself it s the end of the line slows itself colin i haven t heard from you i don t think it s linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on myspace i agree with elsie that it might be decay because it decreased but decay doesn t ever touch the x axis which would signify there are no users ah and there will always be users oooh what s somebody thing about that really really really significant comment that was just made by colin what do we think the fact that it s never going to how did you say it i said that the linear was going to at one point to hit zero and with decay it s never going to hit zero it s going to get really close but not touch it jeffrey i agree with colin because if it was a negative line like a negative line right you re going to go past zero and you can t have a negative amount of users cause a line keeps on going forever ok does exponential keep going forever no i mean yes yes it does but because it s so small that it never touches the x axis but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero so if we all agree are we getting closer to agreeing that it s exponential decay yes if we are agreeing it s exponential decay then what jeffrey just said what does that mean for myspace the company will it go out of business no based on what jeffrey just said about an exponential decay at the end what does that mean for myspace the company what do you know about myspace the company at this moment it s still low it s still low but is it in existence yes it is do you know what s keeping it you know i think because you re always going to have that one user account ok you might you might always have that one user there s something though that myspace provides that other websites don t that s very easy to do that other sites don t have and this is what s keeping it from touching that x axis do you know what it is alicia talk to us i can t hear you music yes alicia who is in the band would obviously know this right tell them what you do on myspace alicia bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them yeah you can upload your music on myspace easier than any of the other sites very good thank you for chiming in alright let s shift gears from myspace now let s talk twitter twitter twitter twitter what do you think about the growth of twitter alright keywords red start me off with keywords and then we ll bounce to pink and around the room give them your attention ladies and gentlemen are you guys prepared and ready for twitter rush i m sorry rush where show me it s missing something there what s your keyword rush it s in the middle of the sentence in the third sentence oh rush is that what you said ok just speak up i m getting old i can t hear growth continues steadily okay anything else yeah but it s at the tweets this the tweeted yeah it goes with this okay so what do you guys pick for the growth what function models twitter s growth exponential growth you think it s exponential growth as well alright is there a team pink you re up i disagree with that i think it s linear because it says that another keyword that they ve given is with 40 million in may that whole sentence right there got it that s like a slope if you think about it with 40 million in may 2009 6 months later 60 million and then 80 million in may 2010 the slope it would be 20 million so it s linear it s going positive slope hmm filling out those listening labs pink just gave some hard core evidence red do you have a comeback or have they won you over you have a comeback let s hear it lenny what s your comeback this can not be because because it s going to get to a point where it s going to stop it s not like we re going to take it like do you have a time machine ok so let s leave lenny i think exponential growth isn t going to stop and i think a line isn t going to stop right and i think that if we think about the future i think that s what star is maybe trying to do is predict the future we don t really know but from the language here in your text the information you do know i think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope do you agree yes yes anybody else want to chime in on this one that i haven t heard from maybe from elianna on blue bleaker i haven t heard from you carlia yet what do you guys think how bout anything you want to add about twitter anything you want to add greg go ahead well what lenny was saying i cannot beat and i agree with them that s it ok thank you any i agree with star because as you mentioned what this does or hope is that they ll be able to tweet via text messages and that s something that facebook didn t offer so the more things that the more things that twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase ok so as twitter grows you re saying the other networks might be slowed who though is going to outperform it if it s a different type of graph who is going to outperform twitter for sure if twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned facebook right because facebook is what exponential exponential very good ok so let s go now to aim we re doing very well on time here aim who s going to start us off with aim alright pink you can start us off keywords and reasoning talk to me some key words we worked was aol lost their dominance lost their dominance okay yep and then we put continuous fielding is growth today okay and we said that it was quadratic equations because at one point it was really high but then as time went by it started decreasing but then it started getting more popular again lately teenagers liked using it so it started going up again ok is there another keyword up here that would help anybody i think there s at least one more keyword that i haven t seen pointed up elianna is it comeback comeback where s comeback beautiful made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier jermaine thank you sorry say that again dominated dominated very nice jermaine so it started out dominating then had to make a comeback does anybody want to add on to what pink said about this being quadratic which way which way would make it positive from earlier positive what talk to me about the equation now quadratic is always going to do quadratics always go up no go down too parabolic this parabola they always look like this no think about inverses we learned through this year raise your hand and let me know what you want to say talk to me do parabolas always open upwards go ahead i just want to agree with them you agree that it s a parabola yeah because in a parabola it says that it started off dominating but you re on top if you re dominating then it said that it made a comeback that means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back they come back up beautiful wanna add to that go ahead i was just going to say the other end alright so i just want to make sure i answered purple s question in the back you asked which way take a look at this this is what you re talking about could the parabola be like this what would this mean if the parabola were down for the company if it was down then that means it s imaginary right you re thinking of something about imaginary and it s not if it s down that has to do with a negative right if there s a negative a coefficient something else though what would this mean for the company s trend deshawn go ahead deshawn they would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up and come back down purple are you alright with that now you understand this would not have worked based on what deshawn just said here s my question for you on aol why isn t aol an absolute value graph what starts high comes down and goes back up we did do absolute value functions right turn and talk first and then you re going to tell me write that question down somewhere i want to know why it s not an absolute value graph oh yeah we did talk about these today if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you re getting ten members then every five minutes you re gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible ok guys bring it back i want to know why isn t why didn t anybody say absolute value i m going to maybe put one over here and then i have one more really important question about these graphs for you and then we re in good shape absolute value the reason i asked that is because that also starts high comes down low and goes back up i need some reasoning let s change it around start with gold and go around go i don t think it s an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend because in the absolute value it s y is equal to absolute value of x meaning that as time passed they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people so like if you gained ten members every five minutes every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what every five minutes or when it goes down every five minutes you d be losing ten members whereas a parabola that changes is not constant you can lose and gain power then they d be equal to join or don t join and you can t guarantee that you re going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed so would it be fair to say it s too con,0.0
two times two aggregating rules smaller the denominator the bigger the fraction that don t work sometimes i know what you re thinking six eighths okay one two three hey look four five six you know it s like division too yeah that s okay six eighths versus what six eighths versus three fourths okay one two three four five six they re equal they re equal one two three they re equal i just did that they re equal wait wait wait wait that s what i said didn t you hear me say that i said if you do equivalent fraciton it is divide by two can we do it the easy way nah cause this is basically the easy way i mean look okay what if we didn t have tiles what if we didn t have imagine if we didn t have tiles we d have paper and pen people back in the days they never had colorful they didn t have a pencil neither oh yeah well you know what i m talking about they had clay and a pointy stick all right so where s the paper you guys want to use a pen or pencil i already got one so who wants to go first i ll go first i will okay group members i can t really explain it you can t really explain it then show me if i said four tenths and one third okay so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third looking at those fraction bars because you add this and minus this it s it s one more than you need no because if you add one tenth to one third it s still going to be bigger oh yeah all right but just looking at these two if i said one third and four tenths which one s bigger four tenths four tenths how do you know by looking at them because three four like six four tenths it s wider than one third good it s wider than one third so now you guys just finished envelope number two and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two who s turn is it to write kayla kayla s so why don t you read the group question for envelope number two without using the fraction tiles how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half how could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half so what about that question how would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half just like we told you it s because twelve well twelve six is half of six twelve yeah six twelve is half of a twelve and five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths okay very good what about what about five eighths is bigger than one half israel what do you think how would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half five eighths yeah how could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half this question right here how would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half because like more eighths one eighth is bigger than like one and like more it adds one half and one half so what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half huh which number which fraction with eight as the denominator would be equal to one half four eighths why do you say four eighths it s one half can you show me with the fraction tiles didn t you say not to use the fraction tiles i know but i want him to see that he s right that four eighths is equal to one half okay guys okay good so then how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half it s one more one more you add to it you know that one eighths is equal to one half because they re like even numbers one eighth is equal to one half four eighths four eighths that four eighths is equal to one half okay all right guys keep on going answer the questions for envelope number two and you guys can get started on envelope number three okay all right guys so you guys are on envelope number one yeah we re done with envelope one we re just like answering this question you re doing what we re done with envelope one but we re answering it okay so what is the question for envelope number one anthony can you read it it is someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third because the bigger the number the smaller the fraction are they correct how would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect so that s something that i ve heard a lot of people in the class say that the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction is that always true no no why well because well the smaller the denominator that means like sometimes it could be like smaller smaller but sometimes i think like well actually you re doing good keep on going well since like they re the whole okay so like two pieces is two pieces one s shaving it all away and the other one is for so what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction how many pieces the thing is cut into how many pieces it s cut into what does a numerator tell us about a fraction how many are shaded how many are shaded so then why right here why right here is nine tenths so much bigger or bigger than one third because it s close to one whole because it s close to one whole and how could you explain it with what we just talked about savannah because it s 10 is the denominator and three is the other so if there s 10 that means there s 10 of the small pieces and there s nine of the small of those pieces but there s nine of those pieces so how many of those pieces are shaded in nine good and what about for one third how many pieces would we shade in for one third one good all right guys well keep on going keep on going you guys are doing well try to answer these questions and then start with envelope number two okay all right guys keep going all right so which envelope are you guys on right now one we re answering the questions you re answering the questions yeah and now i m writing it down four so what did you say what did you actually say for the second question oh we like if you just i m not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it but we just we all agreed that if you keep simplifying simplifying a fraction into its lowest terms and if it can t go any lower than like then it s one half or one third you ll know if if it s equivalent to one half or you can find a common denominator you can find a common denominator and that will allow you to do what to see if they re both the same number to see if they re both the same number yeah pretty much the same number okay why don t you guys start envelope number two then open up envelope number two and see how you order these on the fraction line let s try one half first first three fourths wait wait yeah three fourths goes right there five eighths goes right here no no it ll go right here wait it goes right here so why don t you guys use the fraction bars then to figure it out because i know three fourths is half of one three fourths is half of wait no it would be more it s half of it would be more it would be right here wait i want you i want you to explain that a little bit better for me you said that three fourths is half of one half i mean one fourth is half of one half ok one fourth is half of one half so what about three fourths then and three fourths would go right here because two fourths is equal to one half and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half right also i was going to say that since we all know one half is right here three fourths would go in front of five eighths because one half of eight is four eighths and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths and then that s not the same three fourths of eight would be six eighths good and how do you know that four over four goes right over here cause it s one it s one whole wait no that would be the same place as three fourths wait yeah that would be the same place why would it be the same place because oh it is you said it s an equivalent fraction can you explain what they said why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions because they re the same because because four times two is eight and three times two is six okay and why does that make two fractions equivalent then could you show me using fraction tiles i ll help you you can do this four five six so how many of these do you need six seven so what are you getting the six for i m getting eight six i already have six though three fourths one two wait where are the fourths i believe right over oh okay so show me show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths what do you notice we notice that they re the same length they re the same length and also we know that pretty much what akosha said that if you multiply or if yeah if you multiply like if you multiply three times two and four times two it s six eighths because four times two is yeah four times two is eight and three times two is six do you notice anything else about it here that two eighths equals one fourth good good all right guys let me see the rest of this yeah how did you know that five twelfths was less than one half go ahead six is half of twelve and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths okay okay why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths cause like we don t that the smaller the denominator the bigger it is and so one fourth would be in the middle so that would be on the other side of one fourth okay all right guys keep on going you re doing good we ve over it s over so which one are you guys on now four but we need help with one of the questions on three five no we need help on number four let s look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on then we re not we just have a question on what it is a conjecture a conjecture so conjecture is something that we we ve talked about before in math if it says what conjecture it s kind of like what a hypothesis is in science,0.0
this is a classroom where i push in for language arts this is a morning meeting area and this is also the area where any whole group instruction would take place over here is the area that the assistant sits and works with children and does phonemic awareness activities here is a word wall and where the students keep their folders with their reading books in it their book boxes here is where the classroom teacher does word study this is the independent work station and here is where i sit and i m responsible for the reading instruction this is where the guided reading groups meet this is a little reading area over here where the students can do some independent reading you know what jane told me to do that i liked also looking at the word and chunking are good things to do jane said go back and reread and make sure it sounds right and makes sense and that s something jesus i want us to start practicing a little more when we get to a word that tricks us put the book flat sarah please we want to go back and reread and check and make sure it makes sense okay here s something else i want us to do today with this book rascal i want us to think about what happened in the story today and we re going to do it this way i want all eyes up here we re gonna use this wipe board it s a big wipe board it is and you have a little one and you will probably get a chance to use it too but first i m gonna write on the big one okay the first word up here jesus i m gonna ask you to help me read it i m gonna chunk it because you know the first part of this word child some okay jesus is gonna help us okay jesus go ahead and help me read this word some can you try body somebody good job you see how he broke that into chunks do you see that jane somebody let s think about the story hands down i want you to think about the question before you put your hand up somebody somebody s in the story who is the somebody who is this story mostly about kelly s gonna help us kelly who s this story mostly about put your hand down sarah i think is josie s taking rascal to the vet you re right josie s taking rascal to the vet so who are we talking about in the story are we talking mostly about rascal or are we talking mostly about the vet hands down let her think she ll ask for help if she needs it who do you think the story s mostly about um rascal rascal i agree thumbs up if you agree thumbs up if you agree sarah do you agree i agree do you agree you do i see a thumbs up okay so what did you want to say about the title of the story maybe the story was mostly about rascal because the title jackie did you hear what sarah said she said that s some good thinking sarah she said she also knew it was mostly about rascal because the title was in it i knew it was mostly about rascal because i read the story and they talked about rascal a lot in the story rascal rascal okay rascal s in the story alright rascal now there s a problem at the very beginning of the story and i m gonna go back in the book and look and see what it is sarah what s a problem in the very beginning of the story i read the words and it said he didn t want to go in the door to see the vet he didn t want to go to the vet why do you think he didn t want to go to the vet jackie how come why do you think rascal didn t want to go to the doctor let s listen to what jackie says cause he s scared he s scared how did you know that he s scared jackie i agree how did you know that because the picture shows he s looking like he s upset or sad and i like how sarah said she read in the story eddie she read that he didn t want to go to the vet turn the page i see other things happening i m gonna ask you about that in a minute okay so somebody is rascal and rascal the problem is he didn t want to go rascal didn t want you know what kelly come up here and help me write cause you can write the rest of what i m gonna write come up here didn t oh i m gonna do the want part didn t want rereading helps me think about what i want to write rascal didn t want what to go can you write to go don t forget to space rascal didn t want to go to let s have a bigger space rascal didn t want to go to the i like how you re all looking to see you re good that s fine just keep going good thank you rascal didn t want to go to the who wants to try vet sarah you want to try that s a word we haven t written before but i know that she can think about the sounds in it and i bet you she can do it good job thank you sarah okay rascal didn t want to go to the vet but but what eddie but what he didn t want to go but he went and he was scaring the animals oh my goodness rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared the animals hold on a minute jane cause i know you re gonna help me but he went anyway hold on one second then you can tell me and scared should we say i m thinking about how this should sound i m thinking about what happened in the story but he went anyway and scared the other animals or other animals or the animals he did scare cats who else did he scare the mouse can i have a quiet hand for someone else he scared the cat the mouse jackie who else did he we can always let jackie help let jackie help let s look jackie let s go back and look and you re looking at the pictures jackie s gonna help us jackie i see the cat that jane said what other animal do you see in the picture that he scared the parrot and the rabbit oh okay the parrot and the rabbit okay he went anyway and scared a rabbit i m gonna put this mark here cause i have a couple things i m saying a cat and i don t have room here so i need to erase this word so i have room to keep writing he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and what s the last thing i need to say kelly and a what parrot parrot and i wanted to say okay what did you want to say i want to say that i really know about these i know their names they call commas you re right thank you kelly helped me because i didn t say what these were called she reminded us that those are called commas thank you kelly okay one moment jane i want us to think about the story and i want us to think about what s happening rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot so we have a big problem we need to find a solution we need to find a solution what is our solution to the problem sarah can you sit on your bottom so you don t fall and hurt yourself my solution is that at the end of the story right here he goes in to the vet so he doesn t scare the other animals okay i like how all of you went back to check the solution and you went back in the story to help you understand what happened jane i like what sarah said and i m thinking about how i can write that sarah was looking at this page and she saw how he went into the vet and now he won t scare the other animals okay can i read this page yes and in fact jane wants to read it and she s gonna i want all of us to read it with our eyes because i want us to listen to how that sounds with those dark parts the author said go ahead jane are you ready i love how that sounded and i saw you were practicing that too kelly let s all practice that to ourselves the big dog growled grrrrr rascal ran jesus how did she know how did jane know to say rascal ran how did she know to read it like that the author wrote it in dark and big he wrote it in dark and big he sure did and he said something else eddie that i want you to look at he wrote it dark and big and what else did he put there at the end remember what that mark s called it s a big fancy long word that s okay sarah s gonna help us this mark right here eddie is what we re talking about comma nope but it looks somebody that s talking yes and when they re loud go ahead sarah an exclamation mark yeah that word is a very long word and it s new to us eddie so we re learning it do you wanna try and say it after me exclamation mark yeah that shows they re excited you mean this yeah oh i though you were this oh well no wonder i was tricking you by accident i m so sorry eddie yes i was talking about the exclamation mark okay rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot and so the end of the story should say that it s a solution sarah was he ran into the vet what made him why did he run because he was scared of what the dog jesus did you hear what sarah said so let s think about that but but he saw a what big dog come over here and help me write me and jesus are gonna write this together come on over here jesus lemme move this out of your way i m sorry okay go over here and turn around so everyone can read come over by me but he you can write the word he go ahead write it under here thank you now i m gonna help you give me the marker jackie i need you to look over here so you can help us if we need it go stand over here for a second but he oops he saw you go ahead a a what he saw a what jackie he saw a what a big dog a big dog and those are words you know go ahead now come down here so we don t go too far up dog oops something s tricking you go ahead and turn that around thank you go ahead give me the marker back thank you hold on but he saw a big dog and what happened what happened sarah he yeah ran and he ran okay come over and help me write that then please come on over over here and he ran good go ahead and sit down and he ran where into the vet okay i m gonna just finish this and he ran in into is easy because you know both of those parts and he ran into the into the vet or into the vet s what s that place let s put that office or room let s put room but both of those are good choices,0.0
are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90 no so you won t have any complementary to worry about is that supplementary though you will have supplementary right you re not gonna have to worry about the outside you re just gonna look at your inside when you measure your angles you ll be able to see supplementary yeah then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why we re supposed to draw a line well i want you to see what s congruent sides now you dont have to measure all your sides because have these so you ve got the same colors so they re all the same you re don t have to do angles kinda figure out ok so they re all 90 degrees one of yours looks 90 so you know they re 90s so you got for the outside of your figure you got some a little bit easier work yeah ok so you need to explain why things are 90 and what are congruent and then you re gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there then you ll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles so you know a lot about a square to start with yeah the equal sides have to be congruent and certain sides so write that then measure those angles and segments and see if you can t find some more rules that go with a square oh ok so yes your first set of rules for the first page from here you know a lot you know that any point and what they are you know you have equal sides then you don t have to measure these sides because you used the same color so you can explain it using the colors so you got a lot you know from the first part but then when you draw your diagonals here you re gonna have to measure your pieces see what happens to these angles see what happens to these diagonals and then see if you can t come up with some rules you re main part here you know a lot but now when we do this this will some of the new ok square is the last one that we teach so you will be the last group up there today right we re trying to get these rules today you can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there yeah there s just three of you ok how you doing good what do you notice about some of these corresponding is what i got here down here these are supplementary supplementary because they re what type of angles help him respond well there are options focus on one if we were to look at if i was continuing these lines here they re gonna be same side interior obviously yes so they re not quite supplementary so you might need to go back and do it again sammy knows they need to be supplementary same side interior somehow your measurements didn t get there so go back and try to remeasure you realize you wrote the error that s good so you re using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error yeah so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day when you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way you read 122 when it s going this way it s 118 so what you did is you read this way when you re going this way you said 122 when it s between 120 and 110 at least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it you said it was only off by one degree any amount then again to then explain your rules now what s congruent what s supplementary and then explain why like you were saying same side interior that s what you ll have yes do you have chester marlin yes i do please send him to the office ok what you did was perfect because they re same side interior so you would say this would you say equal angle one and angle four that d be fine because you can go ahead and when you re teaching it you can label those angles and that would be a really good way to do it so it s like angle one and angle four are same side interior same side interior so that has to equal 180 ok bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there your second page when you redraw the figure you re gonna draw the diagonals you re gonna see your diagonals cut each other you re gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half i ll be to ashley then at brandon s group in just a minute so make sure your congruent sides you don t have to measure your sides if you use your colors you can use colors to explain it so yeah you re exactly on the right track here we re just gonna draw the same figure draw those diagonals in there and then we got a little bit some more things you might see bisectors you might not some figures you do and some you don t all right ok it s up to you i love the way you put your letters there so you re getting really good with your letters you can say since you only have one angle at each letter you can say angle j or angle h however you want to do that could we just put supplementary and draw a little diagonal like that that d be fine actually do all these and you ve got your congruent and your angles then you re gonna redraw the same thing over here put your diagonals in and measure again when you put diagonals in you might see some that bisect the angles or bisect segments you might not but that s what you re looking for so this is gonna be well the diagonals we re not gonna draw one of them oh we re not no we re just gonna look at our diagonals otherwise you re breaking it into two other figures and that s a possibility but you don t have to i love the way that you ve lettered it here you re using those correct terms that ll be really good as you go up there all right brandon what all did we mess up so far let s see well it s a four sided figure what should a four sided figure add up to 360 360 does it no it s a little more than 360 so you might need to change things a little bit to remeasure it and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360 there s some that i see really right away that s good it s like 370 ok so you re gonna try to make it work you know you need to make it work you know it s gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better can we just add one here and add two there well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are but one good thing you see you see that these angles are the same which is something you re supposed to come up with which is good now if i was giving this when you re up there explaining it you need a way to explain and i know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent and in your picture that s good but sometimes let s think for a minute if i gave you write them out yeah it may always be the obtuse angle so here yeah that s what i was thinking if you were to do it this way the angles that are congruent aren t necessarily the obtuse ones so what you ve found is good but in your picture it is the obtuse ones but if you can see as you move that it doesn t have to be the obtuse ones let s look at a way we can describe you re saying that these two angles are congruent which is correct so instead of saying obtuse how can i explain that these two and not those two what s the difference between these two angles and those two angles they re 45 degrees well it didn t have to be it could be 45 it looks 45 if i was to do this it s not it s the short side s angles it s where your short sides meet your long sides so the angles with the non congruent sides or the short sides meet the long angles that would be perfect that would be a little better to explain it and even when you re up there explaining a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn t have to be and normally it s the bigger angles but it doesn t have to be draw diagonals that s right and you re gonna look for all the angles again when you draw your diagonals a lot of times you re gonna see bisectors like segments might bisect each other they might bisect angles they might or they might not so that s what you re looking for when you do that and then you re gonna kind of come up to we just draw them like this just like that that s right then you ll measure all of those angles and all of those segments we won t be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside because you won t have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals so you ll actually have to measure that part with a ruler but again you re not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else so that s what you ll do all right i ll be right back yes so are we supposed to do this you don t need the angles that are out there i mean you could but it s not necessary what should of course our figure add up to the angles inside uh huh 360 360 so make sure yours do what if they don t so i think if i was to look at your measurements here i know what i did i messed up i wrote these good perfect that s what i was gonna get to you read the wrong one and didn t notice all right i ll be right back how are you doing so you want to make some general rules so the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel i wouldn t really want to use the words top and bottom because what if you turn it this way yeah well a and b sides yeah so you re gonna do that so you ve got your pieces what do you notice about your angles you ve got the angles that are equal but what if i was looking for supplementary do you have any supplementary angles a and d a and d so you say a and d are supplementary what makes them supplementary what rule do we already know that was why they re supplementary they add up to 180 right they add up to 180 but are they same side interior angles same side interior angles so you can say they re 180 because they re same side interior angles then what you re gonna do you re gonna go to this page you re gonna draw your figure again but you ve got to draw your diagonals and measure the things when you draw the diagonals what you re really looking for is to see is there anything that cuts in half do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments some figures do some figures don t but that s what you re looking for so you re gonna redraw it draw your diagonals then measure you ll have more angles to measure you re actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won t match your diagonals correctly you re gonna have to actually do the measurements and see see if the segments are bisected see if the angles are bisected that s kind of what you re gonna come up with it may be it may not be some of the figures do and some don t ok i think i understand that we draw from angles to angles yeah from vertex to vertex that s right so make an x in the middle all right you re good yes i think we have about everything and then i think we have the other vertex angle bisectors they bisect the angle number five all the triangles are isosceles wow that s good i didn t think you d get that i m impressed he did it good job and then diagonals make a perpendicular perfect what i m gonna do is i m gonna give you another sheet make a bigger square,0.0
glue here we are compression is really compression is really getting it hey guys what ya doin adding our stuff to this oh i ve been trying to tell you that this bridge holds one kilogram without breaking a thousand grams wow that s really good that s probably why you want us to have a railing uh huh so it doesn t just slide off that s true you do want to keep something on the bridge well that s very good and we re thinking about it bends a lot so we could do this it s really bendy bendy and you just broke it don t break it the last time she just dropped it and it splattered all over the place okay so this is the roadway yes okay and then what s going to hold this up we re trying to figure out everything if we get all the pieces and then trying to see what we can do to add it all together do we have um wait a minute guys we could have one of the railings on the front and the bottom the top and bottom stick cause i was thinking we could put this on the bottom guys like if we had one on the top and bottom like on the movie it would hold it down and up at the same time keeping it flat hey you know what we could do we could make kind of like a t shape and then bend the top of the stick and then glue it on that way what would you glue that to you say you re bending it into a t shape okay so you d have a t shape go like okay try to bend that hand me a book we need to put more compression i learned by that idea if i put a book on it it would keep the glue down and it would keep it compressed we need more compression let s get a couple of books here s another one also put a kilogram on it yes you did put a kilogram on it that s true i mean like on there oh okay so this rail that you have over here that s a truss and as soon as we add this is that going to be under or above the railway we were deciding to go above cause it has to have a railing and then below is optional okay but how is it going to get attached we were trying to figure out that okay now we just keep going okay i will come back and check on you all right okay give me a couple popsicle sticks so i can put it underneath will we put them underneath the thing oh dang dang dang it s hard because these right here but only two places are touching oh i see what you mean i don t think it s overlapping because there s the one in between i was just making sure okay yeah i see what you re saying but i kinda think they work because this is really only touching this and here it touches this one but it s not like it s continuously touching from here to here i was just making sure sheesh you guys why don t you all tell me more about your bridge well it s kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge i mean beam bridge okay can you sit up we re continuing to make our arch but we have run into a problem okay we decided we re going to put glue on top of here to fill in some of the cracks that we had it would act like cement but we forgot that when glue dries it contracts so the bridge has kind of curled guys guys logan we re not in your group we re okay also i was thinking when we did the arch it might need support under the bottom but the triangle might be a little odd cause it would stand on this end part we could do what we did here can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be well i was thinking we could just like bend it and put it on that i m going to test this on the weights we need two kilograms if you can get it now how long is your bridge have you measured your bridge our bridge is are you doing it in metric or in customary we re doing it in customary customary okay it s 55 cm or 22 inches and 2 cm okay we re not going to mix measurements it s like 22 and a half inches okay so if you had 12 is that 12 plus 9 yeah so 21 and a half maybe yes okay you guys i got the two 200 kilogram things so we could gram i said gram 200 grams it will be heavier than the glue bottle and that way we can use the glue okay so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go the arch is going to be above the roadway no because here you can t fit two cars but it will go smoothly for the rest of it like we made it so two cars would go right next to each other like we didn t think we could leave the extra space right but they might take off each other s rear view mirrors right we ran into that though what could you do about that we don t really know because all of this stuff is dry so far it s holding up quite well well what if this was only one lane what if you made another one just like it to be the other lane that would be perfect but it would take a good long while no it wouldn t we built this in a couple of days yeah we could glue it together with like these yeah okay perfect thanks miss hoyle all right guys let s start working on that one so are these the same size as these let s try to make it more even this time making that is going to take like 50 days we need 50 of these guys right tell me a little bit about this arch and what it s going to do as you build the arch how is that going to keep your bridge steady well it s like when the arch gets pulled on it s gonna be secured here so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension it s going to go a little bit like it is now okay it s going to pull it away a little bit which means i ve got to get the weight on it so it s going to create the outward thrust yeah which with an outward thrust what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge if you have an outward thrust remember oh it s uh abutments do you remember that yeah you need that something over here to take the force the pressure that s being exerted from the center outward the outward thrust i have a thing with that one it hates me i hate it so have you tried laying your bridge across a 20 inch span yeah we did it on a desk it caved in a little in the middle but when our arched is finished it ll actually help tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle the important thing is what we did was we put glue in between in to act like cement to keep it together uh huh well that made it curl a little bit and so it was a little weaker in the middle because that s where it was starting to bend and also partially because it s it s we don t have a lot of support on the bottom which makes the um its tension affected i kind of suggested triangles at the bottom but we haven t really done that yet yeah that s because we haven t got the arch up yet oh you mean on the bottom of the bridge yeah that s a good idea well we need to start working on it all right well i ll leave you alone and i ll come back and check on you later okay guys we ve got four of these we need a lot more all right then well let s get going i m going to keep working on the arch okay wait wait wait that was part of the arch support the first arch needs to get worked on could you guys make the second road and i ll continue on the arch it needs to get to get built this idea isn t working maybe we should try to like add this on here so that it doesn t like fall oh okay and that way the arch will stick to the top and this arch will stick to the bottom do you girls want to try that sure sure also i think it will hold maybe a little better because nicky it s not all like this is just like that it s still gonna kind of it s still going to kind of stick to this even if we had this idea it d be like that it won t exactly hold that very well show me how it s going to be touching like this onto there i think yeah well like like that this way yeah but like with this on top so like that and then this at the bottom okay it will hold better now actually this is the right way here right yes it s like that okay yes and then we also figured out um when there s going to be 1000 grams on there it broke in half oh no this part it kinda snapped it can hold 500 yeah it can hold 500 it can hold 500 grams yes and 200 and 200 grams yes so i don t oh you tried 700 grams also yes okay so that s not bad it kinda snapped here but yeah so um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the like underneath okay the piers we should add the piers in the middle seriously well yeah we can add it like side middle and side i feel like we should do it like bang one on that side and one on the other yeah but it s still with the one on top yeah yeah we definitely want it want it to hold yeah definitely yes all right i want to see what s going on over here right now working on the railing okay and molly s doing that by she gluing she s working on the sidewalk right now we re almost done with the railing okay and what molly s doing right now is she is we re gluing two popsicle sticks together like this okay and uh we re going to glue them against here okay so they can we re probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle so they glue together easily glue them right here to the side okay and then we re going to put the railing on the side of this so like on this side like this and then the railing will be on this side so that ll the railing is three inches brooke said right so we re almost done with our bridge stuff at this would it be helpful to work from the bottom to glue the pedestrian bridge would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom yeah probably would and even though it bends it s bent it s really really strong uh huh it can hold more than a kilogram oh that s wonderful now did you um what kind of force what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle um it s compression and tension tension is pushing it out like this making the sides curl up and then the compression is what makes the bridge okay so you re going to compensate for that like this so are these your trusses no these are the railings we thought that it would act like a truss okay even though we re not going to have one going on the bottom they re going to be on the top it s all going to be on top and you did try laying it across a 20 inch gap we measured it to make sure it s 20 inches okay good well do want to try measuring a 20 inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it not while it s wet but when it s dry see what it s like what are you doing molly i m gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk and then when it s dry i m going to get them to go together like that okay and then i m going to take my railing how s that going to attach with another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk and then just attach the whole thing to the bridge as one piece okay i was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top connecting the two railings together with popsicle sticks at the top like a covered bridge yeah so this is for a crab run bridge is that what it s called yes that s a real bridge that needs to be replaced isn t it yes and we ve actually figured out what s it s going to be replaced by oh okay you found it on the internet it s actually it s um a beam bridge but it s not over water it s over rough terrain okay and it s in highland county it s way to the it s northwest,0.0
but you re putting children in your sweatshops how are you gonna get more money how are you gonna finance the country still both of you need to listen to cambodia because cambodia i am awesome cambodia is awesome what are you doing to fix this well for the money problem i m not really sure but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you re getting better pay em off and then for and then for child labor you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn so that way they can get better skills and stuff and then put their after that works and everything to age laws i m the only one with an answer i have no child labor whatsoever whoa whoa whoa i thought we discussed that you do have child labor but well we do have some child labor but it s more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired so what do i win as the only one with an answer how did you pull your country off child labor you need to be giving them suggestions and ideas ok what can we do what can we do to crack you told us some solutions the other day right so that s why you guys are supposed to be discussing now ok china do you wanna go ahead and so china you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country you have a plan you have your whole plan in place pretty much what s the first step what s the second step what s the third step what you re gonna do yeah you wanna hear it i do first we ll make it illegal for children to work all day and the other half they go to school ok but wait a minute but don t your parents your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in yes but if they work half the day while they re at school they still earn money but then they re losing half their income but then on weekends they can but they work weekends right now anyway maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there oh now there s an idea what they could establish a minimum wage yeah ok so you re gonna establish a minimum wage yes and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they re employed so they can get more money with better jobs so then they don t have that issue so what are you going to do in the process because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated what are you gonna do in that gap you still have to have a plan for those 12 13 14 years what about programs like those they used in like the de de depression that s the word ok that s what you guys should be discussing those are some of the things you should be coming up with they could start keep in mind that needs money but then they would get loans from wealthier countries and as they re getting stronger and more ok take those ideas and work with them you guys are on the right track you re rolling with it so put that down establish a minimum wage ok cameroon what was your solution say the children stop working and the adults get it well it would be taking money away from the family not other than the ones we came up with on friday like have countries send money what about that like education like half school half work campaign it s like where where you re working part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home and then like with me in my country already go to school so i guess all those times you mentioned but they only go for like six years from age 7 to wait i don t know ok anyway that would help with like the country being france for the win like the same thing but more coffee ok if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things where s your country where s your country ok never mind i was thinking you move at the same time but no if we work together with the coffee export like if we combine the export if we produce well i meant like from whatever we sell we could try to hawk them together to help each other create better education y all can combine your profits in coffee and begin making schools you have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money correct right ok but remember you don t sell that product to the customers you re selling it to the businesses but that s bringing money in to your businesses it s the businesses that hire people and you create jobs so you need to figure out a way to take that industry that product and expand it so that it s bringing more money and bringing more jobs which is gonna help because then you ll have adults you have 45 income we can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs what would be a suitable age eighteen eighteen this mine is not an easy job is it it s hard work it s dangerous down there to have twelve year old kids down there you re still united nations correct is that gonna be agreeable to you you can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product so whatever she suggests to you you have to make sure that that s ok because remember you can tell her sorry it s not gonna happen yup which means you have more money going out than coming in correct so you need to figure out a way to change that you need some money coming in so what are the strengths your country has that you could potentially build and grow when she s got the diamonds i saw a pendant on the internet and it had like a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string ok that s a factory purchase but what you could make i don t know that s what you need to know what does your economy depend on i mean you have to produce something it says making foreign ok i have a question what is a foreign exchange it s nestea s largest exporter so you are exporting product so you do have some products that you re exporting oh you re taiwan you have a lot of textile factories you make clothing your country s the one that s got all the sweatshops so that s what you need you need to build you should be suggesting some ideas to her giving her ideas say ok you ve got a product to export but you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do this they need to find some way to pay exactly wait i have a question for the united nations ok how you said setting up your steps well if there s not a lot of educated people then how are they gonna find teachers well if you said exactly well first you could hire people from different countries maybe if you like hired somebody from like the us that s educated they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they re educated they re doing the same thing that kids are they ve been in child labor and stuff plus when they got older they re just working again so they haven t really changed anything so to change that i guess maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children so you couldn t get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers and the kids have no where to go well i say since they re already adults that we kinda like work on the children more with education i guess because the children are small so before you even take the kids out of these places you have to get all the people and you have to so you have to figure out some like you re gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that s gonna take it s basically you re taking elementary schools you like i mean they could set up a scholarship that way they could go from like and even your country could help pay help pay the people that are teaching because in the long run you re gaining that money s gonna be spent the population is gonna face it they get the cotton for the clothes and get the food for their teachers and all that if we can help poverty to help pay for some schools yes that would be amazing we could also have all the adults work the rest of their life like insanely or something i m the government i can say hey there s laws now that a kid s gotta go to school and he can t work so many days of work so many hours of work,0.0
on a regular basis have you ever thought about what that causes i mean what causes wind to blow in the first place whether it be a breeze whether it be a hurricane whether it be a tornado would you take a few minutes in your notebook would you just draw a line write after what you wrote and i want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind just do this on your own first what could cause wind to blow take a few moments just on your own just like always guys you don t have to be right here i just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing on a big scale on a small scale anything that you ve got that we can build on anything that you put down alright when you have this discussion in a few moments share your ideas with each other and then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down or what somebody else did talk to each other see what everyone there is thinking what ideas do we have the air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks and it creates wind that s good i think wind develops because clouds carries that air i don t really know much alright folks when we go let s use let s see who gets to share person two we re going to go with person two and let me switch this over here real quick so i can write down some of your ideas hold on alright where d my pen go okay here we go person two and we re going to start over here did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow no table seven sorry i don t know but i said heat and cold air rising and falling cause i know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising heat rising how you get in the air i m really not sure so i m just thinking okay so something about hot air rising and cool air falling and like how they re say that again and cold and hot air going over mountains different land masses okay very interesting now she had the toughest job from now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory a different idea or you can agree or disagree with what miah had to say but you cannot say i don t know okay so you gotta kinda run with what s been said keisha we re going to go back to you first what was your thought at your group well we agree with miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind okay so i m just going to add on here temperature i was going to add pressure temperature okay that may be something different let s see what we can add to this so you re agreeing with miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air yeah okay table three you guys had a different kind of theory we agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure how the wind blows and stuff okay so you guys talked mostly about pressure yeah could you pass that up to table two so far we have two theories one has been agreed to already we have temperature pressure our group wasn t sure but i agree with kavya in how the pressure you re thinking that it s something do with pressure and okay there s an agreement here with temperature as well pass that up to table one prescott what kind of ideas did you guys have well we were talking and we kinda agree with a or hot air rising and pressure and air too but i was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind or carry the air faster okay so let me add something about currents in here cause that s another kind of interesting thing so are currents separate from these two or the same or added on to or they another thing all together just added on i guess okay so we ve got temperature of the air we ve got pressure of the air and we ve got something to do with currents could you pass that over to conner conner what is your thought we kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind like low pressure and high pressure you know that s an interesting thing with the low pressure what would cause air to be different pressures i thought maybe the earth s core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others okay so let s see so you re agreeing with pressure and you re kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity really interesting oops hang on something to do with gravity causing different pressures pass that back to david david what did your conversation involve well i thought the i really didn t know exactly what makes the wind blow but if i had to guess i d say it s air masses meeting let s put that down okay hold on and you threw out something that says air masses meeting alright so when you talk about air masses give us more of what you thought of what that is what do you mean an air mass and when they meet how would that produce wind well i know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm i was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass then when they collide it might produce wind i don t know why that s just my guess no no that s fine so you re thinking when you re saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm but maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind yeah so let me put that on so air masses meeting so since we re talking only about wind right now it s the same kind of air mass meeting alright would you pass that back to ah nathan we re going to have you go since amber already went today back over to nathan nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there well we didn t really know but based on what everyone said i agree with miah that it s the hot air rising and the cooler falling but i also think that david s ideas are kind of interesting i agree with a you re agreeing with a that it has something to do with the temperatures miah what s your thought i also thought what david said cause i know how tornadoes are formed but then i thought air masses are way too big and i know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind and so i think it might have something to do with air meeting together i think that has to do with hot and cold air kind of mashing okay so you said with hot air rising and cool air falling and then you said something about hot and cool air mashing so when you talk about them mashing are they like coming together and like swirling together what do you mean by mashing mixing not mashing mixing yeah just kind of colliding together but not swirling okay so when you re saying hot air rising cool air falling you re saying that those two things are mixing and it s by the mixing together that s what s causing the wind yes okay guys take a second i want you to talk we ve got two more tables to go but i want you to take a few moments talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far and then any questions that come up based on it talk to each other alright guys about ten seconds everybody time and three two and one great ideas so far guys let s go to the last any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had yes well i think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass i mean if you re adding water with water it s just making more water huh so you re saying instead of wind being created you would just have a bigger one and i also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it s two of the different air masses but maybe i think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix you re bringing a couple of interesting things you re saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet you re saying that those are kind of like magnets like opposite sides attract am i understanding what you re saying sorry i mean both of the i m a little confused also i would kind of agree with david now because if i m thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse right so would that analogy be a wind refusing or would coming together be more like the wind i think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass but there s the magnets are the same the air masses are that s really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that which is really cool to bring in let me get the two other theories and we ll come back to that how big are air masses well let me come back to that let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in richard what d you guys end up talking about did it change as you saw these ideas yeah so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity s movement actually we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure you know i m going to because i think that s an interesting theory i m going to put it up here anyway you said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself so with gravity and movement of the earth okay and then once you started throughout this round you re thinking more it has to do with changing pressure okay and you agree with what connor was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure yeah so are you feeling like are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together or does something else cause a change in pressure okay alright that s fine where s the mic can you pass it up here i ll come get it abigail last theory go well at first we weren t sure and we were talking about kind of atoms moving like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining but then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air moving and changing make wind from the combination so you re really mashing it all together so your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other that was the first part and then did that end up causing pressures did you say no like and then the different types of air kinda combined i guess so then molecules move away from each other when you say different types of air so like warm hot and pressure and those combine should i add that to this i don t know tom yeah tom i have a question how would two air masses meet if they didn t have wind to bring them well now that s an interesting question do air masses now that s a really interesting question are air masses just these big masses of air and then wind blows them around because then it wouldn t make the wind if it couldn t if it couldn t come together it couldn t make wind oh now that s a really interesting thing so is the wind oh wow is wind a result of the air masses or do air masses need wind to move well that s a really good question ben you had a hand up i just thought about it and i didn t really want to share the question i just was thinking in my head and i thought through the question alright does anybody have any other theories they d like to suggest other than are there let s go through them real quick so we had the theory that said it s hot air rising cool air falling and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind we had the theory that said it s the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity we had something with currents so it s somehow the currents in the air whatever those happen to be that s what s causing the air to move as wind there s air masses meeting if it s the same what dave was saying if the same air mass meeting that s what causes the wind it s gravity in the movement of the earth which richard and this table suggested although they moved away from it i think it s a valid theory to be suggested and then it s molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things so would you take a moment and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you d commit to as far as which one you think it is talk to each other i don t really know like what matthew brought up how they would move so alright guys here we go would you grab the voter that is registered to you and when you turn it on you should have an a through f option and would you choose one of those to be your theory please is this graded no it s not no we re just theorizing right now so just go with the one that feels best to you what s the question it is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow wait for a few more people to vote oh mark we gotta get to voting patrick you in yep you re in okay mark what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best votes are on your voter and fire away and he s the last one to vote as soon as he goes we ll see what way we as a class think oh you got it okay here we go let s see what you think alright so b is our best theory so far so right now as a group let me save this so right now as a group we are thinking that it is pressure and let me ask you this let me get a quick hand vote for this just out of curiosity one of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity how many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then okay most of the people voted that way look like they re going,0.0
what i m going to do is we are going to use these projects to help students at our school mrs ess s class is not the only class that has had problems with students accidentally plagiarizing and that was the original reason that you guys came here today because somebody in another class had plagiarized something accidentally in mrs ess s class your projects today are going to be used in other classrooms so we re going to have a contest we re going to pick the 5 best powerpoints and we re going to send them out to other classrooms to help students learn why they shouldn t plagiarize now some of you are already experts at powerpoint we re not learning how to do powerpoint right now a lot of you already know how to summarize because you learned to summarize in mrs ess s class so you have that experience there was a disconnect where you didn t put the two together so what we re doing right now is we re saying okay i know how to summarize now i know how to avoid plagiarism so let s start working right now you have your rubric look at your rubric if you have a question raise your hand and i ll come and explain it and we re going to start right this very second so go ahead and get into powerpoint and do your powerpoint if you re going to be doing something different like making a newspaper a brochure or maybe a podcast then you re going to start working on that and i am just going to walk around you guys our focus is plagiarism and the way we avoid plagiarism is through focusing on summarizing so you can refer back to your notes remember you used your cornell notes the other day when you were here and we went online and you took a summarization quiz and tutoring session i ll be right there in a second yes i m sorry okay david yes yes absolutely i m sorry i ll be back to you in a moment yes i think that would be a great idea we re focusing on plagiarism and we ve learned about how summarization is one of the ways to avoid it right okay i m sorry sure very good oh great you re back up okay tissues are behind the globe can you go get one for me okay have you been helped you have to know how to spell it right over there on the board how s it going cathy pretty much take off the s i like that though it was good you need some help mr phillip no thank you you re fine what you re doing is looking through here at all the requirements so when you use your creativity to put this together and i yes what does this word mean okay so multimedia basically means that it could be either powerpoint or a podcast so you need all of these to get the highest grade so if you come up with something additional you re going to get a higher grade this part you did here is basically your method of memorization which would be number 3 how is it going pretty good now remember if you re taking a definition of plagiarism from a website then you really need to say where you got that there s a way of doing that you re going to state where you got that and when it was yes that s okay you re going to use your own words it s interesting how different all of these look yes you can you definitely can i also have some books available they re hiding you could eric use this book too i ve got you marked right here would anyone else like a dictionary you can get an online definition too okay i ve got them marked you can find it easily that way can we use our paper to take notes yes of course you can if that would help you cathy have you gotten to powerpoint yet no do you know how to do that oh good okay david i m sorry i ve got it in this book too is that your second slide or your first slide my first okay okay like i said before the purpose of doing this is to try to help other students in our school and a lot of you already know ways of avoiding plagiarism maybe you were even aware that you were plagiarizing and we ve been focusing on summarizing of course there s another way you can do it paraphrasing is a little bit harder but we re focusing on summarizing and besides summarizing another thing that you can do with summarizing is still giving credit to where it came from yes hang on okay what was this animoto video telling us can someone raise their hand and yes brandy telling you not to plagiarize telling you not to plagiarize very good so if that s what you were thinking you are thinking about what we re going to talk about today which is plagiarism now i m going to go on the internet right now and we re going to look at the definition of plagiarism well actually we re going to look at the definition for plagiarize which is to steal and pass off as your own so you can think of internet plagiarism as equal to cheating cheating and that is considered academic misconduct academic misconduct and that s when you get in big trouble sometimes now we re going to watch a teachertube video about plagiarism so you will be using your worksheet and we re going to hear a story about this kid named billy and you ve got some bubbles here so right here in the central box is what you re going to write down you re going to write in this box and you can t write anything yet because nothing s happened so far but you re going to write about what billy did and in the little circles right here you re going to write the causes why it probably happened and you re going to predict what happens to billy so we re going to start right now so i want everybody to listen carefully here we go mrs calstad hey mr harris i have to show you this research report by billy he did it on horses it sounds really good the pictures are good too oh i love horses let me see it wow mr harris this is really good i told you it was but you know what it kind of sounds familiar i ve seen a lot of students looking at this website called allhorses info and i think it s some of this exact same information i think we should check it out let s pull it up sure here s the website mr harris and it says right here the horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries what does billy s report say the horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries so it s the exact same sentence that s not good that s not good that s cheating and look at that picture too it s the exact same photo that is the exact same photo did billy give credit to his sources anywhere on that page no i don t see it anywhere no well that s a pretty serious thing i ve heard of students in college being expelled for that really yes i think they call it plagiarism when you copy someone else s work and don t give them credit and that s a shame because all billy had to do was write down where he got his facts and give some credit to that photo too how could he have written his report differently well if you look at his first sentence when it says the horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries he just could ve changed the words a little bit maybe he could have explained what domesticated means i don t think that s a word that he would use a lot i see what you mean what could he have done with this picture though well he could use this picture if he took the picture himself he wouldn t have to do anything but if he did take it from this website which it looks like he did he d just need to copy the web address down at the top and that would be it that way he could give the photographer credit for that person s work so what you re saying is it s okay to use facts from other sources just put them in your own words correct and be sure to include in your report who wrote these facts exactly and as far as the photos go you can use a photo as long as you include the web address that s on your screen and i think in library and psychology class you and i will work on that with students so everyone will know how they can properly give credit to their sources we definitely will that sounds good now we just need to talk to billy about this sounds like a plan where is that billy okay you have your work sheets let s start filling them out right now make sure your name s on your paper and we won t take too long we ve got some extra time as well so when you start writing if you have a question raise your hand you re going to do the predicted cause and the predicted effects now while you re filling these out i m also going to ask a question i want to do a quick question what do you think happened to billy can somebody raise their hand and tell me what do you think might happen to billy he got in trouble with the teacher he probably got in trouble with the teacher anybody else detention and possibly detention yes suspension say it one more time a suspension very good okay now let s do a quick think pair share okay what is the message of this video so talk to you neighbor let s think in a pair talk to your neighbor the person sitting right next to you cassie you work with brandy brandy you work with santiago talk to your neighbor real quick your question is what is the message of this video okay we re going to stop right now raise your hand if you can share if you can share out right now yes he could use facts and research very good so if he used facts and research information in his own words this wouldn t have happened yes he has to give credit to the original site or the place he got it very good thank you cassie that was great okay so now we ve done our video and i just wanted to say that as a sixth grader i made a big mistake before they had the internet i used an encyclopedia set and i copied stuff into my report and i thought here s the information i didn t realize i was actually plagiarizing it because i didn t put it in my own words so now what we re going to do is we re going to move over to our renaissance responders so right now you re all logged in and i am going to go over to that right now and we have a survey so it s all re programmed and we re ready to go and what we re going to do is we re going to flip our paper to the back side and you ve got your questions right here we re doing an anonymous survey to find out how you feel about plagiarism so i don t want you to feel that it s going to be something that i m going to know your response to because it really is going to be anonymous and i want you to circle the answer that is the most popular response to the group so when you look up here you re going to see a graph and you re going to circle the answer that is the most popular and you re going to star the answer that is the second most popular okay what is the level of plagiarism at our school you have three choices students do not plagiarize very often that s letter a b about half of the students plagiarize c almost everyone plagiarizes go ahead and respond now we re going to look at the graph and we re waiting for everybody to respond right now and i m looking and i can see some people have responded and some people have not responded on your paper you will be circling the most popular response and you re starring the second most popular response can somebody tell me what the most popular response is right now a a okay and that was students don t plagiarize very often that s good to know so go ahead and mark on your paper right now a has a circle around it for number one and our second most popular response actually is c and e so both of those will get starred i m so sorry did i say e i meant c i think that what happened is somebody made a response in a column that they shouldn t have made a response in that column so they answered the wrong question so you did it the proper way we re going to move on to our question number two,0.0
what do you think it is going to be this time i think it s going to be like negative 57 59 maybe like 54 or something colder or hotter you don t need to touch you don t need to touch it you and your temperature i got a playing with your go down the temperature is going to go down with the ice it was 22 22 no not 22 you think ice the temperature is going to go down the water went up it s your choice how much of anything you put in should we put a lot a little more a little more why don t you dump it into not the whole thing yeah oh don t put it all in like that there s hardly any room ready go science is kind of messy isn t it it s okay just put it back in there and work together tell me when to go ready ready and start what do you think i think it s going to be like maybe 20 degrees or maybe negative 10 we ll just have to see 40 jacob 40 no it s 50 40 50 degrees it s almost it s 50 degrees jake it s 50 degrees it s 50 degrees jake what s he doing so where s the line try to put one in oh so now you get it where s the line and it s 40 40 comes out like 44 what s the temperature it changed 44 it says 40 no it s 44 jacob it doesn t matter what are you having a dispute about here get out now it was right here so it s on it s not even gone down and now it went up to what well a little higher than that yours went up so what did how do you know jacob by looking at the thermometer how it went up or down explain to me i know how it went up because i see because if you turn your head away and then you look at it it went up you think so how do you read this though are they there s five lines right let s see but how do you break it up so you can read it to get from 70 to 80 how do you break that up jacob do you know um right you count by twos okay you guys get busy i m interrupting your experimental time you re scientists here down all the way down just color it up to 50 down 30 i wonder what was in it i think it s salt i don t think it s salt last time i used last time i used it it went down and then it went down even more that s what i told you it s floating i m breathing in good water water what happened use the thermometer ready set go one more i think it s going to get colder and i think it s going to get i think it s going to get negative 10 what do you think emily zero degrees maybe negative zero i m not sure there is a negative zero it s like frost all over it cold frost right here whatever was in it makes it go down temperature go down makes frost mystery is salt the mystery grain is salt the mystery grain is salt it s melting the ice and it s condensing on the outside ready guys five four what do you guys think it is what do you think the temperature s going to be this time i don t know lower than 50 555 degrees that would be toasty got to be lower one two three four five i see that most of you have finished your experiment i would like to call and see i m going to get some questions take it out okay eight i have questions teagan your group needs to come to me please thank you very good jacob what did you notice between the base temperature and the first time when you put the water in what happened i noticed that when the base temperature when we put in the base temperature it was only water it only changed by one degree it only changed by one degree very good number nine who s number nine kayla kayla what did you guys notice about the temperature we what happened to it what happened to the temperature it went down it went down what happened to your can who knows think about that take a minute with your group i want you to talk about what s happening to your can and why so maybe it got frost for they get more frost on it when i put and it got yellow the water was clear and then it got yellow when we put salt in it got dirty it looks like lemonade it s all mushy the stuff is looking to the ice that and making it squishy okay one two three four five come back to me for a minute i pulled number five number five what is happening to your can it s getting frost on it it s getting frost on it why do you think it s getting frost what did your group think that it was getting frost on it from the ice and the mystery ingredient the mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty what did we learn about with the weather cycle we talked about that what s really happening talk in your group is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what s coming that s making the stuff on the outside of the can there is water on the side of the can maybe the mystery thing making condensation on the can and because i learned a lot about that i think the mystery one and the ice did it together that could be yeah that could be and combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can i think that the water the mystery ingredient okay one two three four five number three what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff what s that wet stuff called ella condensation it s called condensation what do you why is that happening to your can number three that s you right luke okay what s happening because it s like evaporating and when it touches the cold can then it turns back into cold water what s evaporating stop don t answer that think in your group what he said it s evaporating and then it s touching the can what s touching the can talk in your group figure out if you can figure out what s coming to touch your can so well really it can yeah it s kind of melting so the water is on the can so it s the mushy icky i know whatever mystery stuff now i ll take it it makes me and then it makes water water water everything you know water how will eve s last question nope we re just asking questions right this second you guys need to wait then we re gonna one two three four five come back to me number 19 who s 19 ella okay ella what is happening to make that can wet on the outside the water and the ice well the water tries to evaporate but since there s ice at the top it hits the ice and then it comes back down but then it gets on the can so the water you think the water in the the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that hit the ice good thought let s keep going let s see if we can get some more who is number 12 hayden hayden s not here so let s move on and let s find number nine who s number nine kayla kayla kayla what s happening to your can what s happening to it and why it frosting it s frosting,0.0
okay guys good morning and welcome to class today we re going to continue our discussion on energy but we re going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven t talked about yet so what i d like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea the big idea for just a moment so the big idea that we re going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table so everybody s got their little stretchy lizard without shooting them we re not doing anything with them yet i d like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea i m going to give you and then we ll just go around and see what you think okay so 30 seconds to think about what s the big idea do you know who your spokesperson is going to be alright guys it s been 30 seconds i m going to go to each table if you could just have your spokesperson ready you could just tell me what your big idea is we re going to put it up here and we re going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we ve done alright so how about we ll start with you guys back here since there s just two of you alright what do you think shawn are you going to speak the sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table okay so the sun might warm up the lizard i just put l for lizard that s alright and make it go across the table robert how about your table who s your spokesperson going to be the energy from the sun once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy okay the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard right is that okay who s your spokesperson we said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table okay so it might make it melt and sticky and that ll make it shoot across the table is that what you said alright kendrick who s your spokesperson going to be blaire it was unanimous alright blaire what do you guys have we were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going is going to do what like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it s going to make it jump okay shine and make it jump nicole did you guys decide who your spokesperson s going to be arrington arrington the sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling okay so the sun gives energy and i didn t hear the last part you want to tell me that helps it that helps it okay and last but not least jada we think that the sun give heat to the and make it more elastic so it would stretch okay so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic i m sorry what was the last part again like make it more elastic so it will stretch more so it ll stretch farther good alright so what i d like to do now is i d like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy so if i call your number i would like you to think about what do you know about let s start with potential energy what do you know about potential energy so if i call your number just tell me one factor one thing that you know about it or an example of it alright we ll start with 15 when an object is like still it doesn t move it s holding it in okay still doesn t move it s holding it in how about number eight robert something you know about potential energy or an example of it the lizards alright very good when the lizard is still when it s moving what do you think still alright very good it s stored energy alright it s stored energy and i ll do one more number two potential energy an example or something that you remember about it the pencil is still the pencil is still alright very good now i know we haven t talked about these topics too much yet but i know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it okay the next thing i d like to know is what do you know what examples do you have what can you remember about kinetic energy so we talked about potential now i d like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy alright so if i call your number let me know what you think number 20 a car moving a car moving alright number 13 a paint can being dropped a paint can being dropped alright very good number 14 when you push a pencil and it rolls alright when you push a pencil and it rolls very good and how about number seven we ll do one more like the energy of motion like the the energy of motion yeah thanks alright and if i didn t call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic anybody have anything else to add about it dylan kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling alright very good and that s a great way to start into the next part what we re going to use the lizards for today alright so what i would like to know from you guys is everybody has a bucket on their table right um hum yeah teacher okay and you can raise your hand for this part how can you from your seat how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket anthony shoot it you can shoot it you can just toss it in you can just toss it in there you could pull its tail you could pull its tail and stretch it you could drop it in there you could just drop it in there it s not too far away anybody else okay how about and i m not asking for a demonstration yet we ll get to demonstration i promise how about if i asked you guys instead of in the bucket at your table how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor s table at your neighbor s table javious what do you think you could toss it you could toss it arrington you could sling it you could sling it wilson that was your idea alright walk over there and put it in it yeah that s true i didn t say you had to stay in your seat did i you could walk over there and just put it in gavin you could like throw it you might throw it is that what you were going to say dana alright shoot it you could shoot it alright very good you could bend it back yep you could bend it back and shoot very good how about if i asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other jade i ll start with you sling it you could sling it lewis like you said you could shoot it yeah you could shoot it anthony you could throw it you could throw it so we re kind of hearing the same things right we re kind of hearing go ahead you could walk over and drop it you could walk over and drop it i didn t say you had to stay in your seat alright what would be the difference though between the bucket at your table the bucket your neighbor s table shooting it across the room going out on the football field and going for distance what would be the difference between what you did what difference would you have between this bucket here the bucket at your neighbor s table and so forth john what do you think the amount of energy you re putting into it can you just show me without actually shooting it for example like if you re trying to get it into this bucket i only have to go like this or drop it in there if i were trying to send it across the room i d have to really stretch it out okay the distance away from the bucket okay so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance stretch it more i might stretch it further is that what you two were going to say the more potential energy or kinetic energy it has the more potential energy the more kinetic energy it has so when you talk about the lizard what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has how s it getting potential energy what does that mean before you sling it it s just sitting there alright so when it s just sitting there it s potential what about when you stretch it what do you think that is kinetic okay have you let it go yet no alright so we ll think about that for a little bit what i d like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table or if you don t like what they have to say you can think about it on your own i d like for you to make a hypothesis and i d like for your hypothesis to start with i think and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor s table what do you think you would do differently i think if i do what to the lizard it s going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table so make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one by slinging it yeah talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think alright i ll give you but then compare it to the next table as well what would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one that s what i want you to do okay alright so let me just have let s hear one table gavin i kind of liked what i was hearing from yours ready guys gavin i liked what i was hearing from your table when i was walking around tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis that if you were shooting it at your table you d only pull back a little bit but if you re shooting it across to another person s table you d have to pull it back farther okay any other table have a similar hypothesis so their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table and correct me if i m wrong they d only have to stretch it a little bit but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor s table they d have to stretch it further did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that you guys did how about you guys what did you say nicole we said that maybe we d have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables okay so not only the amount of stretch but also the trajectory of how you aim it alright very good how about you guys over there you d have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it alright very good and i know you guys were coming up with the same thing so we re going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly okay so if that s your hypothesis i think the amount of stretch that i give the lizard will make it fly a different length what would the manipulated variable be what would the thing be that you change between the different steps anthony how far you pull it back how far you pull it back very good how far you pull it or can i put stretch also good what would our dependent variable be what are you going to watch for how do you know if that stretch has made a difference jada alright very good and where else might it go right but you re talking about your bucket and you re also talking about very good so we re talking about distance alright so can i put that down for the dependent yes okay good how about some constants what are some things that have to stay the same guys don t let that table do all the work come on now alright ada the type of lizard the type of lizard very good would it be fair if i gave one table battery powered and the other table not right alright very good sierra what else the size and shape of it size and shape of it very good anything else that has to stay constant or the same how big is the container alright very good how big is the container wilson how stretchy it is okay how stretchy it is alright i m going to give you 30 seconds and what i would like for you to do with those 30 seconds is i d like for you to practice alright i d like for you to practice at this point just at your table if you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end that s fine but i would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area okay alright go ahead without hitting your neighbor maybe move to the side kendra go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference gavin see if you have some information when you re done besides that it sticks to your neighbor s head alright hold on and we ll try it again i promise we ll try it again at further distances in just a minute let s think guys can anyone make a conclusion that starts with when i change the amount of stretch can anyone make a conclusion that starts good job nicole when i change the amount of stretch if i change the amount of stretch far then it goes further okay if i change the amount of stretch when i make it further it goes further alright lewis you might plan for it to go one way but the way that you shoot it really it doesn t exactly go where you plan it s all over the place but if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance,1.0
so you re saying here why did you pick it why did you pick the two points that you did okay why are they random no you just tell me why you think those two what okay average okay so i ll come back here in a minute i m gonna tend to this table what okay what is i don t know what i would there cause they have the what is the all right what is and what is you guys it should say what is the slope okay it should say what is the slope it represents the y intercept yeah it said what is the that s what i m saying people all right i m just sayin it would okay three can i have your attention real quick please all right once you find i see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept okay because that ll help you with question number three okay then i ve got through question number three go head and find your answer and here we have what is this linear okay is that a line no okay were you supposed to draw a line through it okay what does it say down there okay why you did number five before you did number one it said draw a line through right this is like a not a line okay a line is straight so you wanna draw a line straight through there but before you do that i want you to answer and do one two three and four first should we erase this uh yeah but don t worry about it right now i want you to work on finding a what two points did you have um okay and why did you get that because what s easy mean like one plus one and what kind of slope did you get oh you haven t done it yet okay i ll get back to you all right but 72 s what s number two what is the slope what is the slope value what is the slope what is the slope and then i was gonna i actually had started out with what doesn t mean in a situation but when you y equals one and x yep okay y 1x now how do we find what s the ordered pair here okay that s the slope intercept form oh that s what got em mixed up so what is it though and you don t have point slope what is the ordered pair for y intercept is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that s like no that s point slope okay i just want the y intercept okay 2 is the y intercept in this equation y mx b right it s two what did that tell me that s what the y intercept is what does it represent the situation okay now wait it s okay is it for two people so is for people okay now if you were to look at your graph which we haven t done yet and where would negative two cross though i m not sure that s now i m also seeing something here about why do you have a two here hello so 30 32 i know right making me erase that s okay so it s three six nine 12 then all this other junk so you can get up there and get 33 always thinkin six is six eight is eight i m sorry three seconds for every how many people for each person three seconds a person okay no that s person according to your data so it took three seconds to pass from the church right now what is minus 24 okay that s a year you have y intercept is negative 24 and it represents okay i want you to do one graph okay yeah whatever your y is starting at by the way this is a they want you to draw a line okay so what is time in seconds right where does the y intercept it crosses x okay it crosses x the y intercept crosses the y intercept crosses y okay the y intercept crosses the y okay so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what okay all right it s crossing talking about time okay it s supposed to say what is the slope the slope is wards for s you should move your line so that it follows the dots okay i m gonna come back here what s the problem time they re confusing me all right so number three you said the y intercept is six elevenths of a second is that what you re saying six elevenths seconds okay and you said that was what okay all right what were the people doing people were passing books so six elevenths okay means that it took six elevenths were no people what was happening during each person to pass so was each person passing the book at six elevenths that s how long it took for them to start passing six elevenths of a second okay so who passed the first globe i mean who s was that angela okay so he did what he had to run around and then to come back and here and turn a person right he had to leave his desk okay now is that an average throw okay what s your average that you re talking about 14 seconds for every 11 men okay so we might wanna just change that to a decimal okay so just find out how many for one person just change it to a decimal and you might wanna change six elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual okay that s great all right that s okay does everybody understand what jade was saying i think the reason why she did that was because we had to make a line okay now okay that doesn t mean make a line graph oh okay are you drawing a straight line a straight line now we just wanna look at what you got here okay what did you put one one and what does it mean i got 1 27672767 okay and what does the slope on the line now don t worry about your line right now just answer these questions what does the slope on the line your slope of one represent in this situation one second per pass okay all right you re gonna do one second per pass averaged per person one second per person to pass the book get back right okay so what does your y intercept represent if it s at zero with no passage that s what the seconds are that s what the point is okay say that again if there s no passes like the time starts at negative two seconds i guess i don t know how to explain did you get a negative yeah now is that possible no no okay why might you have a negative sometimes it drops okay but if you have negative time okay can you she d be like oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago yeah negative no that was three seconds ago but it wasn t so you got a point two right seconds all right now let s just think about and you said it was what negative two seconds but he wrote people okay when was there a time when there was zero people i mean in this situation during the book pass when was there zero time never when it s when okay when they start moving but somebody was moving i think it s zero passes no all right what does your y line represent time in seconds time in seconds so the y intercept rounded out that s what time in seconds right so it s a time when was time when the books were not being passed somebody had to all right walk over and pick em up and then somebody had to walk over and put them,0.0
and why face changes are different at different pressures and so i think that at a certain pressure they re so close together that they aren t a gas anymore and they become a liquid cool because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out and the liquids can still move freely but they re more close together so okay we thought that in a liquid they can t move as freely as it can in gas yeah yeah well another gas has to expand well it does expand to fill its container yeah so does that have anything to do with how they move well you said that some tried to sometimes they don t always expand as much as they can but i think they do my guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is cause you think of pressed gas what are you guys all thinking about of what you re hearing well do things sound reasonable yeah is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas at what point does that matter or not matter uh huh okay we re gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into that s what i want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what you know maybe the book would say beyond just a definition right if you re going down the right path here and you know what that is i see you re making a nice venn diagram here comparing and contrasting that s great what i want you to do is on this sheet here cause this is what you re going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes put down these thoughts these words that you ve got you can even draw your venn diagram on here but explain what that means what does that mean bubbles floating inside the lagoon what does that mean it s escaping off the top when we think of matter what do we actually think of in our heads conceptually we re thinking of a chunk of matter a beaker of liquid so there s some space and what else and what so matter has mass and volume what s matter made up of okay atoms molecules if it helps you you can decide okay let s think of this in terms of water just so it s a known right okay good yeah that s a good way to do that so draw some pictures when you say it s escaping off the top what does that look like okay so try to get it into some visuals okay i ll come back matter like i don t really understand the definition of heat yeah okay so what is heat it s what heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing right so you want to separate what something is from how it behaves so you re saying heat is the transfer of energy transfer is how it behaves right what is it it s just energy it s energy right so heat is a form of energy and you re absolutely right it can move around in the environment between systems in and out of the system so let s say you ve got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it s hot right it s sitting in a cold room what do you expect to happen what will happen to the temperature of the water for example it will okay so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out yeah okay equilibrium good so you understand that heat is energy and you understand that it can move around so the question here is how does adding heat energy for example matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state so not that it does but how so what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter what is matter something with a mass or volume occupies space has mass or volume you know you just said it okay yeah see you know okay matter has volume it takes up space right and it also has what mass the property of mass do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter like if you think of it obviously this is matter right but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things yes okay atoms molecules what would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it remember this isn t rights or wrongs this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this so what if i have two atoms and i add more energy to them what if i have hundreds of atoms and i make them all move faster well i mean that s what i m asking you guys to think about as best you can how would that occur we said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to and they get warmer oh that s the same thing as adding more energy right then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid i would say add some pictures i think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter what it s made of so why don t you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in say something that is changing state maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see as being a series of steps getting it from here to here so start with a lump of solid matter okay something like that take it all the way to a gas okay how do you see that matter okay okay alright let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that start with an atom and build like a box so folks i want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other theorizing is good why don t you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here yep did i take your pencil i m sorry okay we have a pencil thief so you re saying there s some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time water would be evaporating ice would be melting and vapor would be condensing so i just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory how would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under yesterday we talked about some things that affect phase what were they what was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in okay temperature anything else pressure pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature and the matter itself how that would work okay you may need to mentally zoom in on matter what is it what is ice what is water what is gas if you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk what do we see on the inside what s it made up of at a very small level does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules like you can visualize that so bring that in here if you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that try okay okay how s that sound okay a couple more minutes seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this and you re working on presenting it okay how am i supposed to do this oh god i can t draw cups remember you have to explain to everyone what you re drawing s showing so it doesn t have to be perfect oh okay don t worry about perfection you re gonna get to stand up there and say this is what i drew and they just have to believe you okay that s how bad it s gonna be okay so there s like the water i think i have the difference between the molecules okay so that shows that that s gas and liquid what is the big red arrow it s like going up out of the liquid what s it the molecules okay molecules yeah that s what this is supposed to be so the only thing i would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why like why or how what are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you re drawing to happen that s up to you what you think is making i think that s quite good actually that explains it to me really well the things that you think are having an effect on what s actually going to or not going to happen like this amazing flame like that amazing flame so you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that label it f l a m e you ve vibrated those are actually quite good vibrations that s our gas they re awfully close together these are closer together here than they are here is that something that you intended no there supposed to be really spread out it s up to you what you re going to write i m simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together we didn t mean to do that i can draw more what do you think so we ve shown them closer together do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn t matter so they could be closer together they could be closer together as long as they re moving more okay so i think being like spreading out and occupying all space available so if you re thinking that you should include that somehow and it seems like then you and katelyn and ignesia s have different ideas about this and that s important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about what are you doing oh you re adding to it so i hear lindsey s saying that you thought they d be more spread out occupying more space and i hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn t really matter so that s worth thinking about because that s two different ways of looking at this that s two different ways of looking at this anyway we don t need perfection right now we need your initial thoughts but somewhere i d record that discrepancy i would record here that you re still thinking about that issue you think one thing you guys think another that s important so you guys i think i d like to have groups don t worry if you re not totally done i would just like groups to kind of explain what they ve got so far and we re going to go in numerical order so i am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though and give your poster to one group member let s do that now don t worry if it s incomplete this is a work in progress come on back to the tables don t worry if it s not finished you get to explain it and we re gonna keep these around so you can add to them come on back to the tables i count two alright so group one i m gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster you guys let s load towards the front of the room so that we re all closer you don t need all your stuff just come on up and sit a little closer let s squeeze in in all these front tables yeah you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you re thinking was so everybody come on up as close as you can let s squeeze in at these tables let s get a couple people here let s get a couple people here pull a chair on up come on up somebody come sit here somebody sit here so we ve only got a little bit of time left and i want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts you guys may on your pre think sheets take some notes remember this isn t about right or wrong this is about how do we think we understand this system right now and this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit so their question the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state so you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here okay so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point and we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question we were thinking about specific heat the equation for specific heat also we said based on the specific heat of the substance an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount and we thought that was important and it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat so if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree and then a different substance by a different amount and we also thought about how solid liquid and gas that it has to do with the change of space and the solid they re like locked in place but they re still vibrating a little bit then if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid where there s more freedom of movement but they re still sort of contained and then in a gas and in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster and they re not like moving in a certain direction what questions do you guys have for them or comments about what they re thinking why would different materials have different specific heats you don t have to know the answer does anyone have thoughts on that guesses maybe they re different what different types of material i mean substance so i think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different so they can kind of collect heat differently how does that sound to folks reasonable is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances okay so maybe that s something worth looking into as we study this and see why that why that physical property of specific heat why isn t it the same for everything and so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here because you can see that we drew all the molecules really close together compared to the solid and liquid i guess and we weren t sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely and it doesn t matter how spaced out they are as long as they can they re not stuck in one space like solids are they can just move wherever or whether they have to be more spaced out and so didn t occupy the whole space do you guys have thoughts about that what they re saying do you guys understand the point katelyn s making how far do they have to be to be a gas well i think that that s actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure,0.0
okay you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday what we realized or what i realized is that there s still confusion on going from the general to factor general to vertex or vice versa on any of those three particular forms also another objective we re gonna do is we re gonna figure out determine why each form is important so the first thing i want you guys to do is i want you guys to look at number one on that task card can someone read it out loud i will yeah drew the angry bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters the bird s initial velocity was 14 7 meters per second write an equation that gives the height of the angry bird as a function of time okay so what i need you guys to do is i need you guys to write that equation on the white board okay so now i want people to put it up on the board okay okay so can you guys look around to each other too i know you guys are gonna want to like show everybody what people are getting yay cool okay guys these are the four things or the three things that i saw okay so right here so if you notice a lot of you guys you guys had the first one negative four point nine x squared plus 14 7 x plus 49 can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out you just did it what was the question so can someone tell me how like relate this general formula to the story since you ve read already i wants someone else to speak so who okay jamilah can you explain how you were able to get this equation so the height is c and the original equation is a x squared plus b x plus c and so the initial height is b which is the y intercept and then b is the initial velocity and then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose so you guys is it random no it s the scale factor is there any other terminology for that it s the starting point hey guys do you think it s the starting point is it the starting point or what else it s gravity so wait what does this negative four point nine mean that s the constant remember it s gravity so i heard scale factor okay scale factor but relatively to your projectile motion what is it acceleration acceleration so you guys it s acceleration so right now what i want you guys to do oh actually once again right here here are different forms of an equation that i saw so right here what do you think can someone tell me what s wrong with this particular one they don t have a squared and they don t have an x after the 4 2 okay so ravelle what s the problem with this one there s no y intercept or so once again i still notice now i want to go back to the original equation okay someone tell me in words ah jamilah she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a x squared plus b x plus c but according to the story can someone refer to the story back to the general equation can you rephrase the question yes how are we able to get 14 7 here how did we get 49 here how do you know what stuff to use the 49 is the initial height in meters so that one s gonna be your y intercept and 14 7 is the initial velocity and the initial velocity is always b so awesome so now what i want you guys to do is i want you to go to number two so i want you to put that on the white board can i read it again well actually no let s have fatima can you read number two what does the x axis represent in this story what does the y axis represent in our story okay let s do that quickly i have a question yes did x never mind i ll wait until after this so let s look around so a lot of people are getting what x equals time y equals height so markeisha what was your question i was gonna say could x be distance as well can x be distance people no no if it wanted to why not because it s meters per second not meters per so does that make sense all right so now what i want you guys to do so so far let s recap what we ve done so far can everyone generalize what we ve just done in the first couple of questions we set up the equation and we figured out our x and y axes in the general form okay right now what i want you guys to do is i want you guys to work on number four okay someone read that out loud that hasn t read out loud yet i haven t so leslie you want to read number four from the equation that you got from question number one show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form now what i want you guys to do i want you to turn and talk about the strategies you re planning to use to work out this problem okay you guys i m gonna stop class real quick you guys i m gonna stop class real quick okay so mary can you just ask the question that you just asked me she asked me okay so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about so markeisha jamilah can we use the box to figure it out yeah you can why how hang on put that back away so you guys so the question is okay so autumn just asked can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to and why you guys you guys let s listen please mary sorry you figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers so if you divide negative four point nine x squared by negative four point nine you ll get x squared 14 7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three and then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten okay i ll stop you right there so back to what i said okay so the diamond rectangle method people so when you are doing this what are you finding we re finding the box you re finding the box so what are those things outside of the box here what are they called the factors the factors okay okay when you re using it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula what are you trying to find then all right so right now so autumn so you have questions on that right so later on so do you mind just moving over there real quick because leslie said that you got it down so you guys so take two more minutes we re gonna see both methods so are you done yet no okay you guys stop okay right now i m gonna put this up right here we re gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do okay so right now so how many people got negative five and two no no no so what was it negative two oh okay i got negative two and five my bad okay so right now what do you think was the mistake that she did she didn t square it she didn t what she didn t square and then she re fixed it she fixed it yeah she copied mine it s supposed to be negative 14 7 is that what its supposed to be yeah and is that what she s missing yeah okay guys so that s one mistake that happens quite a bit also let s look at hey you guys what form is this right here what method did they use box and diamond method box and diamond method right okay so you guys what do you call these two items right here what is it missing the number at the beginning the negative four and what is that again what is the name of the four point nine again scale factor or what acceleration acceleration so you guys if you notice this is something that tends to be missing also so now we will look at ah we have the same thing we all have the same thing so same thing same thing all right okay so right now i think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend oh actually so now what i want is so how many methods do people use two okay so tell me one what was one method what was the method that you used quadratic formula okay caleb what was another method that people used the box and diamond the box and diamond right so right now i want people to explain their thinking so what i want you to do is okay since tiffany since you said you did the quadratic formula you re gonna go up and talk about it just talk about the process of what you did how are you gonna explain the process all right so the can we do it on this hard board yeah okay let s do it on this hard board make sure you talk to us okay okay while you re writing things down talk about how you re going through the process so i used the quadratic formula so what are you doing right now i m writing it writing what the quadratic formula okay so you see instead of me asking i just want you to explain all the things that you re doing okay so you guys need some visuals this will be your a your b and your c so you plug all this into this okay so let s do it i have a question yes what if the b is already negative that s a good question so you guys while tiffany is doing the quadratic formula think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier and what mistakes that she may or may not have,0.0
okay so write your conjectures down denominators are repeating actually let s put this one on number four put it on number four we got any even number that had any odd number okay so if it s an odd number in the denominator it s repeating if it s got an even number in the denominator oh okay so you want to add to it not just say it s even if it s odd over even it s terminating it s terminating and what if it s even over even even over even two over six it would one be one over three you d have to simplify it okay you d have to simplify it and so what would happen when you simplified 2 6 to 1 3 it would be repeating it would be repeating so maybe you re on to something might want to record that let s check that s good i haven t heard that one before guys all right let me here some of your conjectures this group we re going with their conjecture what s your conjecture guys that all odd denominator fractions will repeat all right here s the conjecture all odd numbers in the denominator will be repeating decimals anybody want to add to it take away from it change it all right what we got here over here that s false because point two five goes into 100 4 times okay hold on i m confused point two five what is point two five represented as a fraction 1 4 1 4 and they said all odd numbers are repeating so far it works well then 1 5 all right let s try 1 5 well hold on then let s get all the conjectures before we start trying them out i do love the action that you want to make up your own fractions and try it cause i don t think it s safe just to take it at a glance all right dylan what did y all s group george share for your group what did y all say listen guys we had two you had two okay even over odd equals terminating even over odd is terminating okay and even over even is repeating even over even is repeating he meant two by that okay so basically and then i would assume that odd over odd would go here okay my only question is i see even over odd odd over odd even over even what s the other option odd over even odd over even where do you think that would go do you think it would go terminating yes well let s pick something really quick 3 4 that s odd over even that would be terminating okay so opposites even and odd odd and even you re thinking opposites attract there you go opposites attract to be terminating and when they re the same even and even and odd and odd they repel okay and they repeat pretty good here s what i want you to do now based on what you just told me look at number six i ve given you fractions i want you let s look at them as a group i want to come to a consensus as a class do we all agree with this groups thinking we didn t get to share ours because 8 9 repeat okay 8 9 is even over odd and that repeats so maybe we want to cancel this one out and it s just odd over even there might be something else it might be that that doesn t go necessarily doing anything like the rules for divisibility like seven and eight they don t have a rule because it just doesn t work but it s right it might be that that doesn t work maybe if it s even a law you just gotta work it out so do we want to make our rule this if it s odd over eating eating is it time for lunch if it s odd over even it s terminating everything else is repeating we should test it out before 3 4 is terminating but 7 8 isn t terminating cause eight 7 8 try it on your paper real quick 7 8 it terminates so do we want to use this no and yes okay let s let s do more though let s do a democracy here okay if you re liking the well hold on who says no who doesn t want to use this why those rules may not work all the time for every fraction okay so do you have a better rule or conjecture so far is it working based on what we know and the numbers we ve generated so far let s use that rule to categorize the following fractions and i think we could do this as a group so here i ve got our rule we said we wanted to try was odd over even everything else is going in repeating odd over even we ve already done these so here s our new fractions okay what is this fraction here 11 24 it s odd over even so where do we want to put it terminating terminating terminating odd over even would make it terminating six what sevenths 6 7 repeating even over odd terminates but that didn t work that didn t work we tried it and we saw that it didn t work remember yeah odd over even is the only one we re going with so i ve got an odd over even i got odd over odd repeating and i ve got an odd over even terminating okay so here s what i want you to do check it use your calculators as a group check it circle go ahead and write em down categorize them just like i did on the board write em in your chart and circle any that don t belong use your calculator it doesn t work odd over even it doesn t work oh no which one doesn t work seven over six doesn t work all right let s do this then the 6 7 were we correct there all right this one s right no this one was repeating or terminating terminating all right so this one we need to move over here all right 5 13 i haven t checked haven t check that one five divided by 13 we don t know too many decimals okay if it s too many what do you think it s going to be repeating probably going to be repeating so that one looks good let s do this hold on i want you guys to try 11 24 i want you to do 15 14 i want you to check 199 over 200 and i want you all to check nine over 80 these rules already tested out that s terminating the rules weren t tested enough to be proven i think my rule is solid even though it s kind of condensed five four three two one thank you all right 11 24 it stays all right it repeats so it goes over here all right 15 14 repeating all right let me change this though let s change this one to 15 24 check that one and while they re checking point 625 point 625 so it s actually going to terminate okay repeating or terminating terminating it terminated and nine over 80 terminating terminating okay so it didn t work so odd over even doesn t work right it didn t work so let s think about it then we got a do you know a rule i don t know so i m kind of doing this with you let s look at this what is important do you think the numerator is important well if the numerator s what s important i think they re evenly important they re evenly important without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction do you agree he said without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction what do you mean by that you said which one s important if you say the numerator s important then if you change the denominator it might not work so they re not the same fraction without one another okay if the numerator is one less than the denominator then it will be repeating if the numerator is one less than the denominator what about 5 13 that s just one rule there s multiple right well i want to come up with just one rule that works for them all so let s look at this if the numerator is what s important can we not look at these two fractions here what do they both have in common they both have a common denominator and they have different numerators and it s actually put em in two separate categories but they re both odd prime number oh you re seeing something about prime number if it s prime over even it ll be repeating but a prime over an even would be okay so we re gonna do prime over even is which one repeating prime over even is repeating okay because even number has what factor in it automatically two a two and will a prime number have two as a factor a prime number will have two as a factor what are the factors of prime numbers one and itself the only problem with that is the number what two two okay so i think you re on to something if it s prime over even then it ll be repeating prime over even then it s repeating i found a problem with that here s what i want you to do i did 11 over eight 11 over eight it s prime over even okay it is a mix number it s not a mixed number i m sorry it s a improper fraction what would it need to be a mixed number a whole number and a fractional part good job all right so here s my question then here s what i want you to do look up here and i think with fractions we always seem to stress when we re doing equivalent fractions to put a fraction in its what simplest form simplest form anytime there s a prime number it s already going to be in its simplest form right cause you can t reduce it anymore so these are already in their simplest forms what about 15 24 is there a factor that they both have in common three three okay so if i factor out three out of fifteen five i got a five eight so that s an equivalent fraction so i m going to get rid of that odd over even so maybe we could say in a fraction s what simplest form simplest form in a fraction s simplest form if it s odd over even then it what terminates terminates so are we doing a rule that applies to every number every single number so if we were to make a conjecture do we just base it off of six numbers no what i want you to do is i want you as a group to come up with your own example that can either prove this or disprove this conjecture the conjecture is that a fraction in its simplest form if it s odd over even will terminate i want every group to make up their own as a group make up your own example let s do 7 6 you make up your own buck you make up your own you got notebook paper if you want it i made it up so can we do it again no i want a new one they haven t seen so 5 6 5 6 okay try 5 6 is it in simplest form yes okay and so it actually repeats it disproves the theory so it disproves it doesn t it,0.0
now what you just did was count how many times you made a successful eric you made a successful throw and how many times you made a successful catch out of 10 all right we re going to use that information that you just gathered to answer the questions on this form that you ve got you each should have your own reflection sheet all right and i m going to allow you to as a group as a partnership i m going to allow you to talk about the answers together which is just fine because with your partner helping you you might learn something about your throwing ability or catching ability that you might not have picked up on your own all right so now if you look at the backside if you start here each of you should have your sheet in front of you ok and you should have a pencil or you have and i m going to read this to you to help you best understand it this is a chart to help you gauge your abilities and for your progress from the start of throwing the frisbee up to this point it s broken up into four categories one you see where i m pointing at here it says beginning two developing three proficient and four excellent so the question you have to ask yourself is am i still in beginning stages of throwing frisbee in other words do i use correct frisbee throwing form sometimes two it says do i use correct form some to most of the time three proficient do i use correct form when throwing the frisbee or catching the frisbee most of the time and four excellent do i use correct form all of the time all right so this is what you are going to test yourself on i ll read it to you and as i read it to you i want you to mark the boxes again you can talk to your partner and make this assessment with your partner if you d like so sitting with your partner you re talking about it i m going to read it as we go number one movement do you move to meet the frisbee s expected location are you at the beginning stages of that developing stages proficient stages or are you excellent at it do you always move to meet the frisbee s location sometimes most of the time or rarely give yourself a check in the box of where you think that belongs body position ok this is how you position yourself to the oncoming frisbee aside from moving to it this is how you square your body with it are you in the beginning stages where you rarely do it well are you in the developing stages where you do it sometimes the proficient stages where you do it most of the time or are you in the excellent stage where you do it all of the time ask yourself that question feel free to discuss it with your partner all right so you should be checking the boxes you should be checking the boxes that s right there the boxes are already checked next hand position when catching the frisbee do you use proper hand positioning with your palms together fingers opening rarely that makes you in the beginning stage sometimes that s your developing stage do you do it most of the time that puts you in the proficient stage do you do it always that puts you in the excellent stage what do you think what is your target what would you put a grade on now when it comes to the throwing the same things apply your stance and your elbow are you at the beginning and i m not going to go into detail with each one of these now i think you get the idea of how these check are you at the beginning stage the developing stage the proficient stage or the excellent stage when it comes to your stance and your elbow position when it comes to wrist snap and point ok what stage are you at are you rarely sometimes mostly or always again beginning developing proficient or excellent and then lastly when it comes to releasing the frisbee what stage do you think you re at the beginning the developing the proficient or the excellent so i want you to just think about that reflect on that but i m not grading you on this i m not grading you on your ability hey mike would you sit up for me thanks bud i want you just to reflect on what you have learned and your ability all right now with your partner i want you to turn the page over and it says frisbee throw reflections ok and then we have some questions that we need to answer we discussed what angular momentum was we discussed what force absorption was and we discussed what force reduction was with your partner i want you to answer those questions that you see one through seven number one why is angular momentum important two describe force reduction three describe force absorption four considering you don t have to do this i m just reading them out loud before you do it considering the fitness components of speed agility endurance and balance to which sports would you compare ultimate frisbee if you think about when we were playing ultimate the game of ultimate what sports would you compare that to football no you have do it with your partner and a couple more questions where can frisbee be played for fun what are two popular frisbee activities that you are aware of you already know one that we played in class you might know of another two and then lastly based on the activity you did just before we sat here how many times did you catch your frisbee out of 10 and how many times did you accurately throw the frisbee out of 10 ok so go ahead with your partner and go ahead and start answering those questions to the best of your ability you guys should be working off one another and sharing your answers ready set go do we basically no just rewrite it force absorption you absorb the force when you describe force absorption yeah ok start with that and maybe go a little farther and describe what makes it to learn today we re going to begin a unit on indoor ultimate frisbee and we ve got the indoor soft styrofoam frisbee all right one thing about the frisbee i want you to understand number one it s styrofoam that means you can easily break them all right please don t bend them like i m doing here any more than i just did obviously tugging on them pulling them poking them is going to harm the frisbee you want it to be intact so just use the frisbee as it s meant to be used and don t play with it in any other way okay so that way we keep the frisbee in good shape now here is the question we want to answer why do frisbees fly a lot of different reasons and a lot of these reasons have to do with the concept of flight all right like an airplane like a helicopter or a paper airplane okay now frisbee flight s a little different than some other types of flight firstly we re going to look at this angular momentum big word but the concept of angular momentum essentially means that frisbees fly one of the reasons why frisbees fly and maintain stability in flight is because they spin so the fact that the frisbees spin is called angular momentum all right and again that s what produces stability in the air you find angular momentum in a lot of things you guys ever use a top a spinning top yes at home that s an act of a football as a top if i just balance this football it ll fall right it doesn t remain upright but when i spin the football like a top it maintains its upright position that is angular momentum that is why it does not fall down the force of friction will eventually slow down the football and that s why it will topple over and fall but while it s spinning angular momentum is what keeps it up when a frisbee spins the reason why it doesn t wobble in flight and fall from the air is because it s supposed to spin as you can see there and that s what keeps it stable that s also what helps us to throw it accurately another concept is angular lift angular lift like an airplane there s different pressures above and below the wing these concepts are really complicated if you look into them in detail but the basic gist of this concept is that there s a low pressure on top and a high pressure on the bottom and when i throw the airplane that pressure difference is what gives it lift and allows it to fly okay now one thing i m going to do before i throw this airplane is i m going to use force force production i produce force behind the plane and that allows it to fly in the same way i will produce force behind the frisbee and that will allow it to fly the other end is force absorption which we ll talk about in just a minute so again aerodynamic lift is when the pressure differences allow this airplane to lift and i m going to produce force for that to happen can i go get it no we ll leave that there all right now i need one person to demonstrate how to throw the frisbee properly julia please i ll have you stand here now watch you re going to listen i m going to go over this one time with you and then you re going to use these checklists on the cones to teach one another how to do it properly now i know a lot of you listen please i know a lot of you would like when you do the frisbee you can throw the frisbee but there s one the difference between really just throwing the frisbee and understanding how to throw the frisbee understanding the mechanics behind it okay so the mechanics behind throwing a frisbee are just this the mechanics behind a frisbee are this number one i need to know my target two when throwing a frisbee you step with the same foot not the opposite foot like when you throw a baseball but rather i step with the same foot i m going to point my elbow at my target i m going to curl my wrist and bring the frisbee across my chest girls i need you to pay attention if you miss this instruction it s going to be more complicated later so i m going to step towards my target frisbee curled up to my chest and then point my elbow at my target now when i extend my elbow i m going to snap my wrist that s going to create the spin that gives this one two three angular momentum angular momentum and that s what s going to give it stability so i m going to step point the elbow snap the wrist point to my target produce force and on the other end what julia s going to do once i throw it is she s going to use force absorption she s going to catch it fundamentals of catching julia what i d like you to do is square yourself with the frisbee if the frisbee moves to your right i want you to move to your right okay if it moves to your left i want you to move to your left because you want to meet it and square your body to it and last i want you to put your hands in this position palms together and fingers out all right they don t have to be touching but we re going to try to pancake the frisbee all right hopefully my throw goes well here we go step elbow oh wrist snap release one more thing i forgot to mention release it level with the ground if i release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way if i release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way so release it level one more thing to remember ready step nice try don t laugh don t laugh all right i want you to try the same thing i want you to step with the same foot point your elbow in and when you throw throw it point your finger at me remember to release it level you re ready go yes it s all right you can grab it with one hand there s no problem with that that frisbee had good spin on it all right she released it did she release it level no no that s why it bounced off the wall one more time step elbow wrist snap point release level good catch nice one dude here you go you got it perfect now i could have moved to the side a little bit to catch that frisbee but i did a little reach and that s okay too all right so with your groups of four remember wait wait wait you re going to coach your partner in throwing and catching use the checklist on the cones ready set grab one frisbee go can i stand here you and you here you re going to be here you guys are all working together you re going to hold this wait wait wait there should be two on each cone one person holding the cone stop where s your partner you re going to coach her throwing you re going to go first and i want you to catch it and then throw it to her and you re going to be catching and every couple tries we re going to switch okay pick up your cone and coach pick up your cone you re the instructor he s going to catch right all right you re the instructor you should watch her one two three frisbee make sure you re reading and helping all right practice a couple times and three stop stop stop stop now with the catch with the force absorption okay you re absorbing that throw listen i know that the throws aren t all going to be accurate that s all the more reason why you have to move to where you think the frisbee s going to land and meet the oncoming frisbee okay so with your partner s help coach s help keep practicing and we re going to switch in just a minute make sure you correct any improper technique,0.0
and your ideas and we re learning from each other right because a lot of times who do we learn from you each other you learn from me but who else do you learn from us you learn from each other okay kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen we re going to watch another weather forecast and as you re viewing this i want you to pay really close attention to how she talks how she speaks okay as a good listener and a viewer what are some things that we need to concentrate on while we re watching this how she her face her expression and how she moves and looks okay and how are you going to find out if she does those things by watching her you re going to be watching her okay sarah watch how her body is moving because watch her eyes okay catch your eye and i like that you said watching what are you doing while you re watching are you just staring at the screen no you are looking at them and you re making eye contact and you re looking you re watching their mouths because there are people who can t really hear so they would read people s mouths and that s really important to do anything else that you can do while you re viewing this listening okay and how are you going to be listening we talked about this a lot how are we going to listen with our ears and with our whole entire bodies with our whole entire bodies why are we going to listen with our whole entire body naomi because if we re listening with our ears then our hands are up here saying oh i ve got something to say then you re not really listening you re not really listening competently all right can you go ahead and hit play for us please yup just like you did yesterday good afternoon i m julie wunder with your forecast a north wind five to ten miles per hour tonight 28 it s going to be partly cloudy out and we can head to a 7 day forecast about a 50 percent chance of rain transitioning over to some snow overnight saturday and into sunday temperatures fall next week what a cold forecast we have coming up at 5 o clock we ll have the latest on that possibility of snow turn and talk to your buddy we re going to do two right here two two two i noticed that under one of the clouds we had snow instead of rain turn your face okay and what kind of body language did she use she was pointing and so why do you think she was pointing like that okay and because you saw her looking at you did that make you listen any differently did it help you listen more or less when she looked away what was she doing alright so why do you think she wasn t doing this okay like you say she was like why is that would you be listening as well if she were making those faces or would you her face right not necessarily what she was saying but you were focusing on her expressions alright guys let s come back in three two and one okay you guys had some amazing things that you saw when you watched this little clip what kind of things did you notice tell me what you and your buddy were talking about we used this chart if she was just like there she was pointing at it so then it made me understand more but if she was just like there when you did your presentation what did you feel like you were looking at my poster you looked at your poster the whole time okay and the second time when you did your presentation again you said you were really focusing on your eye contact were you able to achieve that goal no no why not because i was looking at my poster again you say you were looking at your poster again okay why do you think you did that were you nervous what do you think you could ve done to ease that nervousness take a breath going to take a breath what do you guys think what could adrian have done to maybe be a little less nervous when he was doing his presentation he could think about somewhere he was comfortable okay think about somewhere where s he s comfortable picture everyone else in their underwear oh underwear sarah be himself and just act like it s just any other day the information we were presenting was it a little bit more in depth than what we usually talk about what do you think was the topic you were sharing a little bit you have a little bit more information than if you were just sitting here having a conversation yeah so that make some of us nervous that we have a lot of information trying to remember yes and then was anyone able to get over that nervousness okay sarah how were you guys able to get over that nervousness i followed my goals and i just tried to be myself i just followed my goals and i just had fun okay do you want to show us part of your presentation where you did that mhmm avril will you move the book away from the projector while she gets the computer ready alright make sure you get to a spot where you can see got it my project is about legends of the i m going to start over with werewolves people think that i don t know why because wolves howl at the moon this is a werewolf a full moon is sometimes called a wolf s moon since its yellow this one is my favorite it s about she calls her brother helius to find her sister herse the study of geography to the moon is called selenology okay this is this is vampires vampires are said to come out on every moon except for new moon i guess because they can see better this is a vampire person trying to get his girlfriend to become a vampire this is people people think to people that are aggressive and violent this is a witch from okay turn to your buddy for a second do you think she was able she said she acted like she was comfortable like it was just any other day yeah talk to your buddy about that do you think that she accomplished that goal yes because she s a pretty funny girl right alright let s come back together let s come back together please alright so her goal she said that she wanted to be more comfortable and she was just going to act like it was any other day did she accomplish that yes okay how do we know that she accomplished that what do you think arizona because she was really comfortable with her surroundings and those people just wanted to get their talking over with and done but sarah actually talked like we were just talking face to face acting like the camera wasn t even there okay and as a listener how did sarah s confidence make you listen better did it make you listen better or did it not make you listen better it did okay why did it make you listen better levin because it was fun because it was fun okay and what made it fun she was acting like the way she was acting the way she was acting okay what did you think dillon because she s usually funny and she was being quite funny on this okay and i like to yup alright anybody else what were some other goal that you guys created sit up and join the circle please alright let s see someone i haven t heard from yet isabelle what was one of your goals one of my goals was to stop making really distracting movements because i was like twisting it and twirling it and i was really nervous alright so that was the first time you did your presentation you felt you were doing too many movements yeah and so your goal was to cut down on that and why did you choose that as a goal really when we watched my first video we decided that she said that she was kind of watching that and she couldn t really have her attention stay on what i was saying and did you agree with her mhmm okay so what did you do with your second presentation i really was concentr,0.0
spanish and you would know if i mean you would know what they re saying because you learn english and you talk you learn english and you know how to talk spanish i agree with you because like because like if they when you said that they had to read write and speak english like they put something that they put something that s english on your paper you d probably understand it more so that s why i agree with you but when they fill out the application what if the application didn t well the application is about like where you re from why are you coming here for like they want to know a lot of information about you i think we should i think we should keep it at one because if you fill out the application you ll know more about people and their birthday and stuff like and then they usually bring them a present okay so it s important to know about somebody now the citizenship board might not go to their birthday party but it is important to know when their birthday is right okay what were you saying ariel i think he must fill out an application because i think you should fill out an application so you can so if you come to america you can if you come to america they ll know when your birthday where did you come from and stuff yeah it s important to have that information why do you think we need to know where they came from because i think they wanted to know where they came from because like if they came from a bad city and they want to come to like a good city and a city or a country a country a country okay if they came from a bad country and they wanted to join a good country then you want to see like they want to see like if they got like if they were bad like where they came from that would be yeah they d have to know that i think i would be because like when they like different countries have different holidays so when they be out like they be out celebrating then nobody won t think nothing s wrong with it because they re celebrating and they don t know that on this day that s when they re celebrating their country i didn t even think about that we need to know about their culture so that we can let them celebrate that s important too great conversation so we re gonna keep that one or get rid of it we re gonna keep it okay so let s move onto the next step and see what you think about the next one that you have to live in the us united states for five years i don t believe that you have to live in the united states for five years because like if you re like i m five years if you re married you re going to have to live for three years but then like the reason why you should live in it five years because like you could get used to the country and everything that s what i think i think that you should live in america for five years if you come from somewhere else because like some people they come here and they see that they don t like it and they try to move back to where they came from and when they try to move back somebody already took their house or something and if they go they ain t gonna have no money to come back because they re just gonna be outside homeless i think there will be some changes to live in the us two years because if you re real old if you re old then they say that you might die in a couple years then if you re staying here if you have to stay here to become a citizen for five years then it takes longer then you wouldn t get the chances to make choices before you die i think you should change you have to live in the us united states for five years because what if if the house is dirty and it s not clean like if it s like the tub still got stains in it explain that a little bit more to me so you said that you would change it to how many years to one year to one year becase if you got in a house that was dirty you might want to do what if the walls was still had stains on it well what would you want to do then move okay where would you move still in the united states or back to your country still in the united states okay so you would still be there so would you want to just stay even though you move from place to place i will do you think you would change the number of years they re gonna be in the united states or just not make them stay in the same place not make them stay in the same place okay so we need to make sure that ariel knows do we have to stay in the same place for all five years no not really no okay i think that if they i think that they should give them at least one year to figure out if they want to stay in that home or go back to where they used to live so i mean if they don t like it on the first day so they won t have to go back again come back to see or come back somebody else at your house at your old house i disagree with you and i agree with you the reason why i disagree with you because they said still living three years just like if you re married and i agree with you because like when you said that they come from the first place i mean the first day they may not like it and they could probably go back where they came from that s why i disagree and agree with you okay i think we should change it so if they look at their choice to go back to their home country for like two months because then they ll miss their family members then like when a couple days in their country and nobody was doing it in america then they could just go back to their country for like a month or something so maybe you guys need to discuss how many years they should stay here in america and maybe if they could how long they could go to visit their relatives in other countries although i think those are all good things to keep discussing so maybe make that decision on how many years and then move onto the next one and i ll come back and see you here but you you trying to become a citizen here but you like want to like you re trying to vote like say if you lived in germany you re trying to go back to germany you can t that s not being loyal to the us because you re trying to become a citizen to the us and you re trying to go back if you was living in germany you re trying to go back to germany what do you think guys well because they have to want to say that a if you don t then they won t have to send you back because you have to be community and jobs so they can get you jobs and what to do and i think that we should keep the rule because say if your old country got in a war you would say you tried to take up them and you re already trying to become a citizen of the usa and you take up for your old country that makes you not become a citizen that don t mean if you re born in your like regular country that don t mean like you can go back go back and forth and take up for them and then when we re having a war you want to take up for us you can t do that you can t like if you grew up in germany you can t take up for germany because you e trying to be a citizen in the us now you can t take up for germany even though you were born there you got to take up for the us do you think that s hard for someone who came to the united states to forget about their old country woudl that be difficult yeah in my opinion i think that d be difficullt because like with me i can make a connection because when i went when i had when i used to live with my grandma me and my momma we used to live with my grandma and i couldn t forget about the things that i did at my grandma s house so my grandma and my cousins but we still were around but i couldn t stop i couldn t forget about what the fun things that we did yeah so what should we put here well i think we should keep it because like you can t go back to your like regular country to do like like you can t fight for the army the army they re trying to stay here to protect us and you re already trying to become a citizen for the us you can t like go back to germany then we should keep that because then so we should learn how to be nice i don t know like we could put so that if like you grew up in germany you can t fight for germany so we re gonna put that okay you have to be true to the us be true to the us how about the next one that says have good moral character is that one that you would keep or get rid of get rid of in my opinion i d get rid of that because people like that s like that s like having like you gotta be like nice to people some people they can t take it like they can t take that they can t like people like i can make a connection because my cousin she got like ups and downs because when people they just like irritate her and they be aggravating her she can t take it no more she just like she just gotta get mad and stuff like people they can t take having a moral character like my cousin she can t do that because people they be like bullying her and stuff and she can t like keep like she can t keep on standing right there and people keep on bullying her brittany do you think we should keep it or leave it i think we should i think we should get rid of it when i was in the suburbs with my godmother she said that my godbrother was getting picked on in school by a bully and he just felt like beating him up what do you think adune well keep it because like why would you let some people get away with most of that stuff you re just gonna let them keep doing the same thing and without the rule without that rule everybody people would just keep getting beat so what i hear all of you saying is that you don t want people to get beaten but you also said that sometimes it s hard to control your anger so you can t you re not always a good person all the time sometimes you make bad choices do you think we could maybe change that rule so that everybody would be happy with it yes i think we should change it to like like when you re like around like older people like elder like older people and like they re real old you can like like you can show like good moral character around them but then when they like go and stuff like when they re not gone like when we was talking about immigrants on the like they was on the boats you don t know what type of people is on the boats it can be like elder people you never know like you can have good moral character around them but like when you like when you re like around your mother don t she want you to respect you don t she want you to respect her but we should change the rule to like sometimes people can just like have a chance to get some people back that really did something really bad to them or caused them to get hurt or something so we should change the rule to like it s kind of like hard for a name but we should think about it i think i have a cause and effect for a good moral character that s why they have like if you have to fill out an application that s why they re trying to like that s why they re trying to like fill out an application to see if you got good moral character or if you re cra,0.0
everybody s using their directions they have their tools and their charts out we ve found today s date so we know where we re going to record today it s wednesday march ninth i know what numbers down of zero mean they are negative numbers that s what are numbers that are down from zero ok i have most friends with their hands on their heads i want to make sure everybody s listening and ready to move on we can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them excellent i m waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads so we can concentrate on the teacher in each group i have one team member that will be measuring temperature if you are measuring the temperature please hold up your tool that you ll be using those of you measuring the temperature what tool are you using everybody thermometer very good the people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers please line up at the back door of the classroom when you get out there boys and girls are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there what are you going to have to do look at the thermometer and you can also compare it to the thermometer that s been outside so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside if you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind i would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom you guys can use the compass and work together go ahead out and see what you observe if you have an anemometer to measure wind speed you may line up if you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges you may line up you may all go and last but definitely not least if you are measuring the when we look at this our thingy goes away no yours is 61 no it s the fahrenheit not the celsius there s something in there what team are you 66 you guys we need to wait for how many seconds it s not ready yet you ve been doing it at home what is it that you ve been waiting how can it be 110 how can it be now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around ok so see where your is and get ready to start counting look at the bee i ve heard both of these ladies say two what you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means what is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds look with your eye with one eye look at this one i can t see i think it s going west when you have completed measuring you may walk back to your group to record your data quietly i got 66 can we compare it to what s on the wall there and see what we have it got 66 then it got 65 and then it got 64 victor could you explain it all to me why you think you thermometer keeps going down because it gets colder and where has the thermometer been sitting all day in there and do you think it s cooler out here or is it warmer out here cooler exactly so our temperature is going down good so let s go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that s been staying outside it s getting brown what do we think the temperature is there it says the temperature is 46 degrees that s probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long all right you can head back in and record i don t know which number to choose the one on the outside the whole time what s your gym it s on wednesday march ninth it was west the wind direction was west the wind direction was west very good i think that you have an accurate reading what s the wind speed it s cloudy wind direction temperature team three is working together and team two and team one nice job working together i think you have to change it temperature victor what was the temperature 40 degrees 46 degrees fahrenheit it was 50 what was the wind speed it s not raining so what did you guys think the was i agree with you why would we forecast that it might rain what s the weather the weather is rainy west put west it was west it was west we found out that the wind speed we said it went around about that many times so how fast is the wind actually going minutes miles per hour we don t go anywhere in a minute we travel like we said in cars in miles right go back to your group they ll tell you on the chart my thermometer s higher than the one outside we discussed that while we were standing out there why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you re holding it inside right now because inside of you it s warm because you told us that it was when you re holding the thermometer the thermometer only feels what s around it and if we re covering the thermometer it can t measure any more temperature only how our temperature is very good so linda if that answered your question that s why we compared it to the thermometer that s been staying outside that we check each day what are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there 46 degrees fahrenheit excellent so make sure you re sharing that and each person in your group use your data linda i think you ve done an excellent job ok we have a few minutes left and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments i am going to pass out your follow up questions and you re going to use data from last week and compare it to today s data to do some equations on here and you do not have to finish today we will do this in our follow up lesson in our next science lesson ok you may continue working thank you write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up ok the wind direction who should you be asking that to today s last wednesday the temperature was what is the degrees between today s temperature and the temperature last wednesday write an equation show your work last wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour what is the difference between you already have your paper i know we can do it by ourselves but it says to work as a team i like it good job keep working with your team i hear her saying excellent i like how i see brianna using her data and grace starting to write an equation and abby and samaya have the date on their paper you guys are all doing an excellent job who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went you should ask that person as soon as he comes back he should have his data on his chart what number did you put there we worked together and we figured it out i know this one i know this one i know that one one second,1.0
in case you think there s something missing and then we ll see what you got okay the tongue does with the the tongue oh yeah because the trachea will swallow it no the trachea s the air the esophagus close your the esophagus is the food pipe for the thing no the esophagus is the thing that stops the food the esophagus is the food part the windpipe is the trachea you talking about the epiglottis oh the epiglottis that s the flap of skin that stops it food going down your trachea your air passageway so you don t choke right how do you spell that how do you spell what are you gonna put that in there somewhere well here s what i m talking about you only need four people in this group and you don t have as many pieces of paper don t take more without asking why are you taking more why because tyler got on it go wash it in the sink i ll mark down on my clipboard who s having trouble with self control go to the sink and wash it with soap and water all right so you guys do not have the same number of papers that they have at the other table because you only have four people so i m gonna let you add more if you feel that you could add a few more pieces to fill it out more go for it and then i ll check in with y all in just a minute add head yeah but she said it has to be a word what s another word for stomach acid stomach acid acid why don t you put acid that could be anything in your stomach stomach acid s kinda like a compound word well actually since stomach s already here and if we put acid right here you can t just say it s any kind of acid yeah because it s going down the mouth to the throat to the and they have acid in the stomach well that s the intestine duh acid i m gonna stop you right now because we wanna take this to another level but what i have is i have several groups with several different ways of looking at it what seems to be a common thread among some of you is to order things to put them in an order of sequence i had one group that grouped them so what i m asking is that i m still seeing a little bit of food in there and i m still seeing that you ve got processes some people have processes in there and body parts we got lots of body parts so what i m gonna ask you to do is if we could put if we could create a big system on the board with the pieces and if there are duplicates this is why i didn t want you sticking em too much we just put it on top so i m gonna ask you to do this this is gonna be tricky we re not gonna have a lot of time so i m gonna ask you to bring by groups your post its and put them on the board this is our work space so if you think it should be in out five groups four of you think it should be in a linear kind of grouping so we re gonna go with the sequence of events order so what i want you to do is put em on the board and let s look at what you ve got if there s duplicates put it on top if there s something you have that s different figure out where if you can move something can it share a space does it happen at the same time we talked about it over there what three things did you have esophagus throat and neck so they thought those were on equal grounds that they were all either in the same place or the same function i wasn t sure i didn t ask them but they ve got them together so this is gonna be hard it s real easy sitting there with your group of five or six or four people now you ve gotta work with twenty four twenty three okay so we re gonna start with group one and if you can just come stick em on the board and i m gonna get group four next and you ll go up with them so you have to make one picture on this board that shows me how you think they fit if you wanna put them in the same order don t make them touch leave enough room for manipulations yes no pardon the abdomen is the middle the butt is the fleshy part the anus is the actual opening and the rectum is the tube yeah so it s very distinct differences they can t interchange all right so just stick em on and then move quickly got em all right got em on that s why i said they re not going to stick well if you keep sticking them on your face and get the oil from your face all right make sure you agree now you re gonna go up there with your post it notes you may need to use some of their pieces you re welcome to move any of their pieces to fit in since you re coming up there after them and the group that comes after you will be free to move any of your pieces okay all right y all pay attention all right got em all right can you do me a favor and plan before you get up here how you re gonna do it so we can make it move quickly all right guys have a seat now they don t they have some words you don t have so how are you gonna make this work you gonna put yours up above it we re gonna put ours in our order we could fit their s in there there you go however you wanna do it come up and get their voices what s next mouth water where s water i think we need mouth i have teeth tongue then teeth mouth i have taste buds it was tongue teeth then chewing it was tongue then teeth saliva it was saliva saliva chewing i think it was tongue then saliva no it was tongue taste buds saliva teeth then chew and then i think it was esophagus next i have intestine stomach and waste stomach and then intestines and then waste and then kidney no put em on the same all right we put theirs up now teeth intestines i m gonna leave you guys for last over there you have a smaller group i m gonna leave you for last all right all right so health health should be overall i guess it s like yeah yeah you get health from eating proteins go with food no yeah nutrients how are you doing it s kind of hard to put this in the same group with so you were looking linear and now it s hard to go linear because they ve thrown these other things in yeah you have a scrap board what do you do you might wanna build off that s what i m saying or like switching some some of them are very vague and that s exactly it if they re vague you re not quite sure how they tie in you weren t there for their discussion so you don t know what their train of thought was so make it work and realize that somebody s gonna come behind you and they might change it let s put protein and nutrients but health is overall all right this is getting very interesting their strategy you have to realize and i ll make the point while we re waiting for them to finish because they re having their own discussions when you have your discussion with your group your having a discussion with a small group so when you get up there and you see a word and you weren t there for the discussion that brought that word into the list you weren t there you don t know what their thinking was so just like we always say you can t disregard somebody s input because you don t believe it should be there you have to find a way oh i m sorry i m sorry thank you i need you next because y all have the next least amount thank you for catching that you have to make sure that what you do doesn t lose the meaning or change the meaning and doesn t judge somebody else s input you have to just make it work grab it if you know where it goes all right but if by some chance that s what happens when you start stacking we can use this masking tape in little tiny pieces all right go for it ooh are you all right is it still working you re fine yes we re okay you lost a nose we dropped a nose a nose but you see it s ok it may not have stood out in your discussion and you might have brought something to the discussion that they didn t y all gotta talk louder okay nose should be here literally put it right on top of it stomach okay teeth chewing epiglottis esophagus wait esophagus esophagus wait if you have to move something or if you think it needs to be this is the esophagus in other words if you think you have to move something over to fit yours in because it s not there and then intestines and then acid this word s already here so right after the mouth then intestines and then to the kidneys and then to the waste and then health do you wanna move it somewhere else if you think something should be on the same plain i just use the example of scrabble game with them i think saliva i think water and food once you put it into your mouth you re gonna get saliva okay so see what they did so if you feel like you need to move anything we need to get saliva back in there so how s saliva gonna work saliva goes with taste buds and mouth and tongue put it like in the middle okay it should stick wait discuss go ahead tell them what you think it looks like are y all ready are you almost ready no you do know the more that get up there the harder it gets so you re making it harder for us no i m making it harder for them oh all right i m coming got it they have like three on intestines let s put a little piece of tape to hold up the intestines yeah just stick a little piece up at the top it doesn t matter and can you add this to the waste so it doesn t fall all right you guys good okay go all right how are y all doing out there are you watching this unfold yeah and group one i mean three group three you guys look at the task ahead of you it s gotten bigger i need tape all right i m gonna give you a little bit i d like you not to put too much on the board more on the paper you have to figure out if you have a duplicate then just tape it over the top of it anything that s duplicate all right all right i need tape you need tape all right so where do you put stomach all right so he s got a question about where to put stomach no i have stomach acid i m seeing where she s putting stomach it s over here this is acid all right so it s way down there so move down there i need some tape and i will tell you the same thing i told the other two groups think about scrabble so if you have to go in a different direction to make something work you just go in a different direction you make it work okay you guys have the hardest job or it might be the easiest mucus where does the gallbladder go what is that epiligotis oh my bad but look how much came out that s good we didn t have that much expansion on that idea before all we had was body parts can we have tape for two what do you need two pieces of tape all right two pieces of tape all right how we doing emily where do i put mucus mucus goes with the in between the neck thing is that everything all right y all ready would you do me a favor and tell mr dresser we need five more minutes you have a test oh tell him three minutes thank you so we need three minutes you got it okay i think it s good all right ready guys all right have a seat okay now everybody goes up last group take your papers go i need a band aid for what to put over my your what let me look and see if i have one sometimes you have those little bitty ones okay i will look if you need them thank you all right if you re stacking it and it won t stick i have tape here stick your mouth on that mouth this we can put over this can we change this yes use this all right you got it here just put it like that all right how are y all doing what do you have left why don t you alex would you lift up health and move my volcanoes just slide the volcano down it ll come off just slide it down now you can do it that way do you need more tape all right how are we doing in case it doesn t stick got it all right now i want you to while you are waiting and i appreciate the patience that you guys have had i want you to watch and look at what it looks like now because some of you made some significant placements and they ve made some significant changes to that so take a look at what the resulting image is here y all finished wait don t you think this should be over there that s right they get to you have your perspective and they re bringing theirs to it and they had what could have been the hardest part or the easiest part okay i wanna pick up on one thing that you guys said because one of the things that you had when you came here and the group was already had already laid all this out was that they felt strongly that the mouth needed to be here so why because food goes in there paging mrs dalton dalton come in i m sorry hold on try it again like if you re eating something like a hamburger or you re drinking water it s gonna go straight to your mouth and then it goes in there so in the order that we ve established here do you see what they did do you agree with that yeah is it logical yeah ok is there anything else that you placed that you recognize was changed and you wanna know why it was changed or you went oh because i did hear a lot of oh we didn t think of that when you were watching these things go up like at first i thought that that should go before that don t know that i don t know what that is um the glucose water and food okay this column of yes i thought that that should go before the mouth because i was like but don t you put it in don t you put the food in your mouth and they were like yeah but once it enters your body it s not first in the okay using that logic is there anything else that should be adjusted blair uh where the nose is okay what do you think we should do with that you should put the nose right before the mouth or after because it s like you kinda smelled it before you put it in your mouth so would this be logical if i moved this over and put this here like he suggested yes i want to disagree you disagree you re welcome to smelling it is not a part of digesting it at all yeah that s what i said is growling a part of digesting it no it s the way your body reacts to the smell if we use your logic i m not saying remember the way we work things in here is that you can t judge if it s right or wrong you can certainly disagree with it that s true i may disagree but this is your work this is not for me to this is what you re thinking so but using the logic you used growling light headed and dryness in mouth is not a part of digestion but what do these things have in common i saw someone what do these things here have in common they re symptoms of hunger ok so you re calling them symptoms of hunger what else might they be indicators indicators is there another word signals signals if you have stomach growling you feel light headed you have a dryness in your mouth that s a signal right and where does the nose fit in to that and i ll come back to you you have an answer for my question with the nose or you have something else to add like the nose the nose indicates that you re allowed to put food in your mouth and so you prepare with the saliva so you can help break it down so the nose so if you can t smell it s like when you have a cold you can t really taste things okay but does the saliva not flow because you can t smell because you said you need to smell to be able to get the saliva to break it down so if you can t smell if you have a stuffy nose or if you don t have a sense of smell does that stop the saliva no no she said i don t know and that s an okay answer she doesn t know you could have an opinion,0.0
we are now getting into earth sun and moon interactions we have done one thing well we have done several things all year on that first slide which you copied onto your board what is it the moon phases the moon phases you do the moon phases every day so you should be pretty familiar with moon phases what they are how they happen all that good stuff we get to move on okay let s start with something you do know what is a moon phase tom it s what well it s technically when you look up in the sky and like what light you see in the moon good what light you see in the moon where does the light come from the green she s reflecting the sun the sun how does that work the sun shines on the moon and reflects back good the sun shines on the moon and reflects back so that s how we see the moon do you agree with that i see most of you agree good okay then if we know that it comes from the sun why don t you tell me some of the moon phases so we can build on what you just told me what are some of the moon phases this one should be easy waxing crescent waxing crescent excellent aisha waxing gibbous waxing gibbous very good grillen waning crescent waning crescent bailey full moon full moon tom waning gibbous waning gibbous ramos 1st quarter 1st quarter excellent new moon new moon excellent last quarter last quarter third quarter third quarter and last quarter very good when we talked in the last class some of you said second quarter then the second quarter is half time so that would be what moon phase what s halfway in between first and third what moon phase is that full moon yay full moon yay yeah just start spouting everything out and then eventually you ll be right that works for me yeah it s a full moon get it half full or not okay so we have all these moon phases how can you tell which one s which why don t you just look up and say yay it s a fingernail how do you tell which one s which because different moon phases look different how does it look different because it s okay because different parts of the moon have light on it in different amounts okay different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it how would i be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something you re almost almost there yeah i think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces good very good different kinds of faces one lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side which one lights up on the right side the waxing how do you know that because um well you always told us it s light on the right it s wax iting yeah it s light on the right it s wax iting or what you guys like to do wax on wane off or wane off i don t know wax on okay so i don t have a problem i don t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon i think you guys are pretty set on that how about what causes the phases of the moon what makes that happen you ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun but why would you have parts why wouldn t you just be able to see the whole thing all the time sean because the earth blocks out some of the light that s coming from the moon okay good brenda because the earth rotates with time and when the earth rotates the earth blocks the sun so you can see maybe at the top of the moon okay good tom there are other stars shining in different directions not just the sun okay very good stars shining at different directions anything else nancy because the moon is moving and so okay as the moon moves we see different phases so i hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon the sun from reaching the moon are you in agreeance yeah a little bit yeah yeah somewhat okay here s what we re gonna do you have won the experiment you ve done the flip camera but what i want you to do on your table everybody has like a big lollipop you either have the blue styrofoam ball you have the big white styrofoam ball you have a little styrofoam ball i want you each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls okay and then you are going to come this way down in your light paths you are gonna come up front and gather around my lovely light bulb okay come forth children and you might wanna squat down if you re near the front yay i know it s bright good can t see oh you can t see okay alright oh okay what i want you to do and you re already doing it hold it out in front of you i want you to look at your moon what am i holding in my left hand the sun the light bulb the sun you have the moon yay here hold it out in front of you what moon phase do you have on your moon aisha new moon new moon why is it a new moon because you can t see any light you can t see any light i can see lots of light it s blinding me oh there we go but there s a light source isn t my moon illuminated becky it s illuminated on one side but since you re behind it you don t see any of the light coming well then how do i know it s illuminated because you can see other light oh so i look across from me and i see sean sean you have a full moon now you re supposed to disagree with me and tell me that no you don t oh okay um what moon do you have a new moon no you don t you have a full moon he has a waxing moon no he doesn t he has a full moon you all are crazy look it s illuminated on the other side okay oh yeah you could do that but then wouldn t your head be in line with the earth it doesn t make any sense but that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated not that we have 15 different moons or 28 or however many people we have but just because we re looking at a new moon doesn t mean that the moon s not illuminated it s just the other side so i look across and i can see full moon across from me what else can you see from where you re standing tell me what you see and where you see it yes over there with zack and sarah i see fullmoon okay good over there i see a waning gibbous really i see a waxing gibbous uh becky i see a full moon over at zack nice i see a waxing gibbous with charlese i see a full moon well i see a waxing gibbous why why do you see a waxing gibbous and i see a full moon because we re in different places what s that got to do with anything i thought y all told me that we saw moon phases because the earth s shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon how can we see moon phases then tiffany ooo kaitlyn line of sight line of sight what does that mean um besides your sight in a line it s um well because sunlight s here it looks like a new moon but if the sunlight were like over there it wouldn t huh interesting brooke well i m just suspecting that lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then like i couldn t see a shadow i could only see the new moon oh because oh well oh lauren s head is in the way look at if the earth was in the way that if the earth was in the way would that cause a moon phase yeah is the earth in the way of the moon all the time no what could we call sorry what do we call it when we have the earth and the moon and the sun lined up or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the earth or if the earth is blocking light from getting to the moon bailey an eclipse an eclipse have we talked about an eclipse before a little bit just a little bit so is there anything in between me well is there anything between the moon and the sun in my no no vicinty because if i ask you you re gonna be like yeah lauren s head is in the way she s blocking all the light there s nothing in between me and the light source yet all around you re saying you see different moon phases correct mmm hmm mmm hmm i want you to think about that why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball but there s nothing in between us because the moon and the earth is at a different angle ooh cause the earth is at a different angle because of our position your positions very interesting here s what i m willing to have you do you all have a light bulb some work some don t i know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb so you might have to share but i m gonna have you go back to your seats some of you have three people some of you have four people some of you have two daniel you have three now i want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb where you personally can see four different moon phases or three different moon phases depending on how many people are in your group so you need to be able to see if there are four of you four different moon phases you stand there you hold it and if you get it raise your hand for me now okay that was your challenge you don t have to fill anything you don t have to do anything off you go try not to blow it alright move michael where do you think it s gonna be put it like this okay it doesn t have a switch it s just automatically on and off yay we made it nice are we getting there okay okay since you have four people you re going to position yourselves differently than they are they only have three so you re gonna think think about a clock where on the clock will you put everybody so you can all see four different moon phases from your angle well one can go at twelve twelve twelve six and nine and three like a cross do it i don t think we can put anybody over there and then tell me when you get it we can t put anybody over there so that ll be like twelve this ll be like well we need a camera for it right there we re not using a camera okay well now so brenda can stand there brooke can or we can do like um like this kinda way i ll be here she ll be there and she ll be there and you ll be at the corner yeah okay so take your moon it won t move until you stand there and hold it no i see yours new moon no it looks like a waxing excellent ladies and gentlemen i have a group who has it ooo it looks like i have another group who has it ooo i have another group who has it somebody tell me if you equate it to a clock where are you standing tell me what numbers you re standing on jamie uh oh oh forget about that for one moment we had it she s on number one she s sitting at four on a clock she s nine she s three and six and twelve good so one of the ways you can do it is twelve three six nine you can do it that way or you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides what are you moon phases that you have um that s waxing gibbous waxing gibbous there s full moon new moon and this looks like i see full i see new and then if you re at nine and three i should only be able to see half what would those things be mmm go ahead first and third quarter good first and third quarter i want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it okay something besides those four and you got it too okay we could get a and then someone could be could be right there and right there yeah i see a full moon i see a full moon i just see a full moon because your the light source i see a full moon and a i see a full moon i just see a full moon do you see a half moon here i see a full moon well now do you wanna switch out okay i ll take it okay it s blinding ooo yay oh yeah i see a new moon and i like see a everybody got it at least once yep yep okay do me a favor unplug your light bulb and come back to your group okay was there anything in between you well actually your moon and your sun no no so does your theory or your hypothesis that the earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work no carolyn says no tom technically it can work because when you have a i forgot what kinda eclipse it s called but it s an eclipse of the moon it goes like all red or something we had it this year and the arth earth arth the earth is blocking it in a way worse okay so is that going to change the phase of the moon nightly becky no she says no do you agree so what changes the phase of the moon ben the way we see it from earth the way we see it from earth agree yes ah interesting now when you did the experiment before when you did it with a flip camera we re gonna re watch some of those videos i m just gonna do the montage so it s not necessarily gonna be your entire class but we re gonna go through and you need to critique each one you need to figure out do they do something wrong do they do something correct do you need to do something with that do you need to re think your flip camera video because we re gonna do it again after we get finished with this make sense are you sure mmm hmm are you positive mmm hmm let s watch the first one okay let me play it for you again see the phases yeah alright now i want you to tell me besides being blinded what did they do correct what was right they were in a orbit not around the sun just a orbit excellent they were not orbiting around the sun a k a the lightbulb what did they do incorrect they didn t call out the phases okay they didn t call out the phases they didn t orbit orbit the camera they did the camera was in the middle so it went around so that s okay think about that they went around there s even something wrong,1.0
well frogs do sink they do it s sinking what do you think caused that to happen what made it sink that time i put it like that and and then it was sinking alright but now we saw some pictures where the real frogs got on lily pads and didn t sink so what do you think is different it s like stuck to the ground and the lily pad is stuck to the ground yeah i think there s something inside i think there s something in like dirt you know like that causes the lily pad to grow but with something in the lily pad seed we were looking at this the other day do you girls remember about that okay what were you all thinking about that they don t but what were you thinking andrea you know these eyes right here we don t have eyes like this but frogs but frogs jump really high if they don t jump really the same they probably just almost jump if the momma and daddy frogs turn into get some eggs and the tadpole comes out that tadpole right there he was following it and then he stopped what if they took the flashlight they might move yeah like this watch when you take it off i did this in my momma s when you take it off and you turn it this way he looks back at it like this that s what he does how come because when tadpoles like eat things that glow then when you take it off you put it back on how come why i know they just don t but that s not fair what else did you notice we did the spots what else did you notice jamal look at it again frog what body parts do you see gray polka dots you said the spots the feet the feet what about it lines on it some lines on it and what are you saying nikera you said it had some things on it that white stuff what is that what is that white stuff on it s feet see if i can get a closer look what is that jamia do you see that the white things on its feet it s his foots it s his feet do you have that on your feet no they need peace and quiet if they don t have a calm river look they live in ponds dude listen listen there are trees right here there s flowers listen latan be quiet i m thinking that this is very calm rivers and this is what you call that ooey gooey stuff that ms robbie called it that s the lake and that s the pond and there i am frogs they need grass they need flowers they need little trees they need i was thinking aleha thinking about us living in houses we live in houses because can t breathe water this is my house and like there s dirt under there and there s dirt under there then under that runs the water the blue water let s add something to it so what made it work this time it stands upside down the frog floats it doesn t jump on any kind of one it only jumps on the ones that are round because it needs something facing up to make the walls because this is facing up so you think maybe the lily pad faces up right if it does this it needs like a shield so the water won t get in because if the water touches it it will tear and it will sink did you listen because they need something on it like rain so you re saying if water touches it what happens if water gets on top of it it ll sink because it ll tear the lily pad up and it ll sink but with the flower on it it does not sink so if it has the flower you think the flower keeps it from sinking because it s stuck it s stuck and it s so hard it makes it so hard and rainy and it dries up so when you dried the frog off did that make a difference well it doesn t make a difference frogs like to be wet frogs are usually wet that frog is an african swimming frog because look at it s feet it does look like an african dwarf frog it jumps on the water it can run and hop on water andrea what did you notice about this what did you notice i know that we have it doesn t float let me show you which one which one what about this one he was growing legs no this one s growing legs but that s what tadpoles swim in okay you see them shine it on it no you see they re moving because they re growing legs if you yell really loud the glass will break and then the tadpoles frogs the frog s body there s a water snake there s a water snake a water snake what are you talking about over here this thing has a frog in it and he just swam okay so we re talking over here ms robbie look so you re comparing the pond to your house yeah alright did you see this that she found out it says the frog is pulling off its skin i wonder why it s doing that because so it can have different skin why would it make different skin it might need different skin because of the way it lives the way it lives it has to take off its own skin just like a snake takes off its whole skin snakes take off their skin be a new frog the way they take off their skin is they shred it off they don t have any arms snakes shed their skin off and they don t have no arms snakes shed their skin yeah do you think frogs shed their skin too what do you think aleha you found the picture tell me what you re thinking let me hear aleha when it gets old they have to take it off he has to take it off why do you think he needs to take his skin off i was thinking just a moment daniel let me hear aleha i can t hear when it gets too rough on him he can take if off maybe if his skin feels rough hmm i m wondering about that that s giving me something to wonder about ms robbie there s a water beetle yes but we re still looking at this about this frog coming off she feels like maybe when his skin is rough he takes it off what did the page say it uses a word i m not sure about molt it said frogs molt a few times every year because it s the way they live it s the way they live but we don t live that way the same way we do we get bigger instead of shredding skin you re right we get what what d you say say that again we get bigger we get bigger and they shred and they shed their skin that s opposite hmm i m going to write down that word molt we re going to talk about that a little bit we re going to try to explore that a little bit more the frogs are underground and they hatch out of the eggs and turn into the tadpoles and they re going to grow up a little and they re going to lost their tail and they re going to turn into an adult frog and then they are underground when it s winter when it s winter they re undergound okay what have you all found out about comparing the frogs protect their babies do the frogs protect their babies no they don t what about your they wait until they hatch they wait till they hatch frogs have bigger eyes than us because they have those eyes like that on their heads and we don t and we have eyes that are small and when you were born did your mom or dad take care of you or your grown up yes i went to my grandma when i m a baby okay did your grownup take care of you when you were a baby andreas yes yeah well what about the mother frogs no i got a lot of food i love you got a lot of food i eat chicken and rice everything andreas just think about our tadpoles is the momma frog in here taking care of those tadpoles no they wait till they hatch maybe the momma frog missed them probably if they die after wintertime,0.0
brooke what did you choose the cylinder why okay five and what about you ms leah cylinder why because it has two faces it has two faces and what about you ms cecilia the sphere and why you need to write your words down okay so write your words down so you guys can hand in your sheet who thinks wants to cut who think will cut here what about samantha then you okay and then me then brian okay but he goes you too you called you want to hold and stretch well that s the one you re doing and you ll be cutting okay so katie cuts then samantha then me and then brian he is going to roll the shapes down the hill i ll stretch and you can hold okay samantha wait guys this is guys it s the sphere spheres those are spheres that s the cylinders no this is the sphere color you already got here how about i ll be who wants cylinder raise your hand who wants sphere who wants cylinder so it s three versus one so do the cylinder first and then use fine i ll get on it you guys working it out alright yes blake what do you need we need more string you need more string okay alright keep that one right there and roll one of your other shapes and i ll get you a longer piece of string okay hold on i got it right here i ll tie it on there how s that okay is that going to work for you alright isaac go ahead and stretch it out how long it was we need to hang that up you can cut this tie okay i ll cut this time i ll have don t roll it now i can measure it i ll cut it now leila roll it down move the cylinder blue blue oh we have only blue when you guys are measuring who s doing the holding you are okay foster hold it who s doing the stretching because you re going to have to stretch it out you can t cut it until it s stretched you re stretching and so sierra s cutting okay foster you hold it you gotta stretch it all the way out yeah okay cut it right here like that here there you go open it a little bit more there you go okay and foster go put it up on the graph and sierra you can throw away the extra okay good job what shape is this hunter sphere sphere alright and what do you know what s special about the sphere it rolls and what s really special about it it has no faces it has no faces you re brilliant okay the next one whoa you can cut it you may be able to i want to straighten it measure it the sphere went the farthest so was your prediction right jackson was your prediction right yes no no so you want to circle no and you want to circle yes anthony was your prediction right okay so you want to circle the check mark for yes your prediction was right and then you guys can get some crayons and draw your observations and what you saw in your experiment i think the cylinder okay who s letting this go me okay you can t measure it till she lets it go ready go cecilia let her go look at the poor little cube why do you think it doesn t go very far because it has sides what kind of sides squares and they re what flat flat alright but now you ve picked it up

what were you saying joe i said young people definitely benefit our society overall more than old people in the country why just because they can progress contribute more yeah like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people yeah they re a lot more active compared to old people more who just is gonna basically sit at home i mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling the rebellion is completely composed of the youth yeah if we look at the political situation in america like obama s election was pretty much the 18 to 21 year old vote it s just like clearly they re like better at affecting social change in this time period that we re discussing why would you want the youth to come well because this is like the start of all social change in the union and i want young people to bring a youthful energy and determination and some sort of hope about the country that they re moving to and that all my union in here they re gonna progress they re gonna like technology and they re gonna invent stuff so you re onboard with the i m just saying we still need more money they re going to be working and they re going to be taking money out of our economy because they re gonna want to pledge how much are they gonna spend like we need old people to spend a lot like rich people to spend but we need workers yeah no so it s like we need workers old people cannot work we need a combination if only get young people if we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with the old people on this list aren t that rich yeah but there s the bottom line is gonna be more than just the old people there the old people other countries but right now we re focusing on that they re going to be moving and they re rich who would move here why would they move to the land of opportunity if they don t need opportunities i didn t mean to say that that s honesty okay yeah but i mean i see that it seems like the majority did the majority rule on that because i guess who was against having younger people come in i know matt was was matt the only one who wanted older people to come in ok and you were also i m a loner you just went with the consensus yeah okay good another point another point also old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life aren t necessarily going to be all that interested in america okay as a country and wait and also they re not going to vote they re not going to you know try to participate in the country itself so they re just here to die in comfort okay go ahead darvel on the way it s already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the united states because so many people died on the way getting there so they might die on the way getting there so don t even consider them to begin with right or if they re sick they can t come into the country anyway like we re not going to let people who have cholera into our country because then it ll start spreading here so you said colema or column isn t that more in cholera that s like okay i was like what what else did you guys have on your cards what about religion does religion matter no i don t think it did no no that s one thing we i think we all could agree on yeah oh everybody what about the nativists what about the nativists darvel you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group well i mean it s kind of like on the edge of the he s conformed but i because most of the time it s christianity in the united states so also majority rule yeah majority rules usa usa okay so who did you guys decide to wait was that the end of your criteria or no we had there s still reasons for coming race and knowledge of english previous jobs and oh what d you guys say for english what d you guys say they have to know english yeah we said they had to know basic english at least at least a little bit they have to know some of it or enough to you know find out where the bathroom is really or enough to like communicate or have the ability to learn it with other people who may not know english that well and boss you were okay i mean i feel like i m one of the only ones who disagreed with that because like being a boss like i have connections like in every part of my city and every community and communities are often like separated by race so by race and and language mm hmm so maybe different communities wouldn t have trouble communicating if they only knew one language mm hmm but being a boss with my connections i could definitely like i could make it so that they could communicate and i can get them what they need help them out okay i don t think now english is a necessity well you wouldn t i think it s pretty i mean how are people supposed to communicate and it s just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it because i mean overall the majority speaks english but we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages so they could just they re getting by though right right i don t know if you should know them working in factories you should know a lot of these people yeah but you might even know someone when i think of like different languages i think of like the tower of bavel or babel it s like in the bible story where like everybody spoke different languages and then the tower collapsed so like if everybody speaks different languages we can t get work done productively because we don t know what each other want like if we say yo go make this type i don t know just do this job and then they do something else you need communication darvel what do you think about the language piece well i think that speaking english is basically it s a necessity i mean obviously you would want workers to come in because he just wants money he doesn t really think communication is that important but as a nativist i believe that it is why what will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages maybe be different races different ethnicities what will happen to the country if we let those people in i mean that could create like conflict between the work because like matt said they really wouldn t know what to do while they re working also that could change the patriotism of the country as well but will they know why they re working not really so people who don t speak english don t know why they re doing a specific job well probably yeah i mean they know that they re doing a job to get money right so does english really matter i m just asking i mean they re not gonna really x you wouldn t care if they spoke english because if they didn t speak english it might make it easier to exploit them i somewhat care because they have to collaborate with the people they re working with to get the job done the way i see it is they can come into the country with a you know as long as they have the mindset of i should probably learn english to succeed in this country then i think it s a good idea because if you re going to be immersed in a language you re going to be able to learn it eventually so i mean as long as they try to learn english or try to know basic english i think they should i mean i think i agree to darvel like if i was a nativist i m not saying i am but if i was a nativist i wouldn t want hoards of people who don t speak english coming because i mean it s like america s pure we ve got everybody speaks english like we don t want but does everybody really speak english right now not now i m saying no not right now in 2011 but in our age that we re discussing if i was a nativist in my even then right in my like ideal world you would want everybody to like speak english okay the whole world should speak english oh goodness yeah that s what a nativist would say i went with the english speakers because like to properly rebel and have a voice communication is vital and i think that people who aren t speaking english won t be interested in what i have to say can t even understand what i m saying so okay well you guys decide and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically okay yeah all right thanks guys oh we already did education s not really that important to me though i think it s really important dude it s saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren t educated to begin with well education like you would want educated people as a non union worker like i don t care about education i just want to keep my job and i want like union workers to get out of the country and as a union worker i want educated immigrants because then they would stand up for themselves and like change factory conditions me being a tycoon i just want people to work for me i mean they can come to this country they can live the american way i ll supply them with a job what s the american way american way is to well but you re not giving them any money wait wait wait what s the american way 2 5 kids we are actually 2 5 kids white picket fence dog well that s the american is that the american way now or then we re talking about then labrador basically the american way is i want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in okay that s my concern well but they came here to like succeed and you re giving them like two cents an hour i mean for me with education though it s not that big of a deal because then again if they re coming to america they re going to have to learn our customs and our way and with them being uneducated that s easier for us to mold them into society and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for and stuff like that but this is supposed to be like a free country and they came over here because we like grant that and we re just like manipulating them yeah but like basically the only people i want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs like people who are kind of like who are those people kind of like sketchy people kind of because like you want sketchy people to come into your country well sketchy people are about to give me jobs because like sketchy people are about to like what do you mean by sketchy what does sketchy mean when you re saying sketchy do you mean poor or like nah i mean like people that are like rich and stuff and they ll like have a business and whatever but like they re corrupt a little yeah they re a little corrupt so they won t like hire union workers and they ll keep their people ununionized so i can come in and take the work make that cash know what i m saying oh okay so you want it that people will have money when they come into the country but not be on the side of unions exactly so that they will they ll give me jobs they will okay they ll hire non union workers they re not people that are going to be entering the workforce they re people that are going to be like already kind of upper you know what i mean okay so you want people with money coming into the country yeah exactly okay did you guys decide on a criteria already yup or are you discussing a criteria we have a criteria this is our criteria pretty much okay what s your criteria we said non educated which some of us don t agree with who didn t agree with it i don t agree with that why because i did not agree with it america is the land of education everybody needs an education you can t come here well but at this time remember education is not like going to school it s more of knowing a skill or a trade it s like street smarts almost well if they don t know anything then they can work yeah okay and we decided on that do people really need to know a lot though to work in these factories no but like no my business is to teach them how to use these machines we don t want them to be taken advantage of i mean but at the same time i don t really see the importance of education if they don t come with like money or some type of like i don t know some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in america because you may know you know how to read 100 books but that doesn t help you like start a business or something like that yeah yeah but not like that kind of education like education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay like so they can stand up for themselves and like be able to like negotiate with you why is that not okay i mean everyone has to get paid everyone gets paid that same amount yeah but they re living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions i mean that s in your opinion a house is a house yeah and then look at where they re coming from they re coming from religious persecution they re coming from these governments that are collapsing these war stricken countries exactly and the government i think it s better to work in a factory earn some wage yeah but how much are you earning compared to them eat or have necessities in life i mean but there s also government support too that s where i come in i set them up with a place to stay stuff like that you know that s what government s here for is support of people that come in here so it s best when they re not educated it s best when they don t have money because that makes it easier for them to get help and that s what we re here to do is to help people but then they re relying on you and they don t know what to do with themselves like when you they re relying on him but then he lets them rely on themselves so they come in rely on him and then he kind of sends them like how helps them out how does he keep people from relying on him because then all right so i can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives like if there s a politician voting for labor laws i can help them if i m with that politician i can yo this is the guy you want to vote for this is the guy that will help you that s like brainwashing though they like have a right to think for themselves honey this is america exactly exactly exactly so you re saying that nobody should campaign ever you re saying campaigning is brainwashing no you could campaign but you don t exactly he s just campaigning can i just say something no but he s like getting them all to agree with him okay if you think about it this way you can really have people from all spectrums of money wise like from all kinds of economic backgrounds you can have the more rich people come in sorry the education backgrounds the more educated people are going to come in no matter what they re going to help our country more than hurt it then for me i can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education and i can give them a job i can start them off in life and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves why don t you better their working conditions then if you like are helping them because i mean still this is much better no because they like die in those factories it s better than being killed by their previous governments wait have we decided no it s not it s not the same thing have you guys already decided on this piece already yeah we have like our set laws we just have disagreements about that you guys have disagreements so you guys were able to a consensus on them yeah well we kind of voted on it we decided that they have to be non educated come with some sort of money their religion and race doesn t matter come with a family,0.0
i teach in a second and third grade combination class the students are arranged in grade level specific table groupings this allows students to complete any grade level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that s clear to them i also have a guided reading area and a independent reading corner all of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place as well as collaborative group work students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work they have a listening center where they access books on tape and cd we have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects or they do research on the internet but complete sentence okay for that first part all right and then someone who s taking turns so we re clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around questions if they make a mistake do you want us to correct their english or you know what what i think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak and i do this a lot so you might notice that i restate what someone has said and that s part of being a good listener so being able to recall or restate something like oh i heard you say and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate that s a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you re trying to teach and be a role model i have a different idea i think that is okay so there s another way i think that is excellent so we re going to just try this out and see how it goes we re going to try this out again and practice those cues are we the same number as usual yeah okay so here we go we re going to practice when you get to your pictures this is what i want you to do right now i have put i have this image of a whale on okay can you have a seat i need everyone sitting next to their partners right now so what i want you to do is looking at this picture i want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture what do you see so i want you to share exactly physical features and use descriptive language to talk about what you see question hold on a second sweetie i just called on jonathan just a second question we re going to describe with our partner so you re going to need to turn to your partner adam what did you i don t really understand what that thing in black is you know it s just a shadow it s a shadow this one it s just a shadow on the picture it just doesn t look very clear the way it came out it s the shadow on the image okay all right so turn to your partner when i ring the bell number ones share first when i ring the bell number twos share when i ring the bell i m going to take some of your descriptive language sharing what you see number twos okay excellent so i m going to pick a stick i m going to go fishing in my sticks and when i call your name i want you to share either what you saw or what your partner saw okay what was the detail that was shared and i m going to write it up on this sticky note because i m modeling now what you re going to do when you get to your stations everyone s going to get a stack of sticky notes and you re going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see number 10 cesar sorry you want to ask a question for a clarifying question no i was just making a comment just i don t like it when there s only like one sticky note for everyone because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see and it takes up like maybe three quarters of the whole paper and then the next group has like okay so we re going to solve that problem because each individual gets a sticky note okay and then you re going to choose where you re going to put it all right so number 10 cesar madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom and she said an orca and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth she actually named the animal which was an orca she saw white spots on the bottom and what was the part about the teeth and a few sharp teeth oh sorry and then sharp teeth okay so i wrote more than one idea on this sticky note but what you re going to do is after we do the conversation after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it then you re going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note and put it onto the picture so let s try one more i m going to turn it over so look at the picture and then i m going to ring the bell you re going to share and i ll pick somebody else to share what they see okay so who s next number 21 roberto my partner says oh what i said it can be what you said or what your partner said whatever you decide his was good i said that i see a pod of orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water that was great so he has two points that he sees the pod which is how we refer to a group a group excellent use of the vocabulary the orca whale so he s named the actual type of whale and he starts looking at the dorsal fins which is one of the physical features not only of the orca but of what the humpback doesn t the humpback that s right it doesn t have a dorsal fin so which ones have the dorsal fin all the others ones except for that one there s a couple of other ones as well blue whales don t blue whales good good good good good eyes up here are there any questions on what i want you to do when you go around to the different stations yes sarah so how many sticky notes are we going to get like a couple four or five so first i m going to give you a chance to walk around and then i m going to come around and i m going to give you some sticky notes so you re going to let us look at them and then we re going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on yes exactly exactly what s this this one s cool i see some baleen which means it s a baleen whale and it looks like it has a big mouth and the baleen looks like it is some sort of bendy thing and on the bottom of the baleen it s scary and it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale i see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies and a person s touching it i m not sure if it s a real whale that s alive it might just be an exhibit no jake and so i don t really think this is something that s underwater it s part of baleen it s like a baleen whale there s baleen but it looks like a blue whale because it is very big it also doesn t have any throat looms and it has just a small bump for it s dorsal it also looks like it s swimming very close to the top and that also looks like it s coming up for air i see a whale that a man is touching their teeth i m not exactly sure what type of whale this is but it s a whale i see someone touching part of a whale and it might be part of a baleen i see a whale and i think it s coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water i think that that is a baleen whale because it is it is white and it s a little bit gray i see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water and i believe that it s a beluga whale i see the whale i think it s going to jump out the water and then dive i see a big gigantic beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles and it doesn t have a dorsal fin,0.0

present your position to the other side make sure that you include the sfi that backs up your position okay after that three minutes we ll swap sides all right so three minutes pros go right ahead we re talking about how minorities have made a lot of progress since reconstruction and political things originally there was no black senators or congressman but after reconstruction around 1865 there was two black senators and fourteen congressmen and now there s four black senators and i m sure more black congressmen it s like quadruple the representatives and other minorities are representative represented in the house and senate so they ve made a lot of progress becoming a representative government they didn t have the knowledge of earlier so that s one way reconstruction positively affected education in the south in america also these statistics show that even though even though certain states are slightly low on the circulation per capita statistics virginia is number fifteen which is relatively high for a southern state except florida is number thirty four and not all northern states were held higher than education held higher than southern states like pennsylvania west virginia and delaware which are all northern states are in relatively low positions on the scale and former slaves were able to kind of give back more to the culture and they influenced technology and science and advances in those and kind of started influencing culture in the south and kind of in all the united states so and it really basically spread freedom through the south and finally gave the former former slaves a voice and a place in the country and finally brought them together y all have anything else i found the ones they could like progress forward and they could because they have so many african american positions and authors for that for that i think overall it finally gave blacks a place and gave the south a place in the country again where they had been separated for so long kind of started bringing everybody together again because after the civil war the south still thought that we don t have to cooperate with the north all right guys that was pro all right three minutes let s here the anti three minutes and then we ll after listen real quick guys after this three minutes we ll give it another minute okay and one more minute after that for a rebuttal okay for the final statement of the pros okay go ahead antis 1865 time of reconstruction and during nothing really got done if you look at the statistics the infant mortality in mississippi is number one and if you go on to the lifestyle statistics mississippi is the very has the least number of museums concert halls and observatories in city centers showing the link between reconstruction and just how it affected the south and how nothing got done after the civil war let me i m sorry to interrupt let me ask you this what caused i mean there had to have been something i mean during reconstruction everything was progressing something happened to cause that overwhelming shift in numbers that you just pointed out that you know the southern states the old confederate states dominated the bottom of that poll why do you think that is why would that happen because the north is trying to punish the south after the civil war they re more focused on helping themselves and not helping the south because they re more focused on slavery than actually trying the help the south because they were trying to punish them so they didn t they were trying the free the slaves they weren t trying to help the south because they didn t want them to become stronger also was there a particular event that really solidified this that really made that come to fruition what is it the time frame of your question 1865 to 1877 okay so during reconstruction right so what happened at the end of reconstruction why 1877 what happened in 1877 they took the military out of the south exactly so if the military was pulled out what do you think caused this result economic constraints imposed by northern owners and eventual overseas competition hampered development and birmingham never developed into the world class steel making center that it was supposed to be so yeah it did sort of improve but it just never reached its potential because and it even says hampered by northern constraints so the north basically said you can t produce more steel because we say so so you can t so birmingham just couldn t really get any better at that point so the south has more industry now like everything in the south is in the lower twenty eight percent okay guys listen we re going to give you one more minute you have a one minute period the pros if you want to add a little rebuttal to what you just heard okay after this minute we re going to take two minutes to compile our final position okay like our final little thesis all right that we re going to present then to the class okay so one minute for a rebuttal from the pros go ahead because since the military left everybody revolted so they had no motivation everything that had been implemented for those years went out the window and but i think it s still a positive way was that it at least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order and the south still kind of had gotten a taste from the military on how the americans wanted things run and how they needed to do to function as america and so i think that mostly the military reconstruction like that was good because it kind of came in and helped them that way what is the number of african american senators and representatives what does it show what is the difference between reconstructive era huge difference all right guys listen up you get two minutes i need each side to compile your final argument okay your final statement this is what you re going to present to the rest of the class remember you need sfi to back up your position okay that sfi can be census data more importantly it can be book data okay just normal normal information from your text so two minutes go ahead and write it out if you want go each side comes up with their final points we could go into more detail on the three fifths compromise and we could mention the ku klux klan intimidated even though they got the vote they were still controlled by the white people yeah the social system still was there ok i ll write that down could this be applied too absolutely remember you have to explain to the class in a way that they can understand it okay they don t have that particular census data in front of them so make sure that you re clear when you present that as sfi in front of the class tell them how many libraries and virginia is the only one that s in the top fifty percent completed out of fifty and so all the southern states are in the bottom and then this is trying to say what twenty five right here oh so the bottom twenty five half existing at the time which was should we tell them that these states aren t or should we just not tell them no i would just most african americans that were unskilled at the time worked through this program to become more independent workers and to learn to read and write and so i ll go back to my statistics here virginia and florida all right guys we re going to go in this order listen up we re going to go in this order we re going to go economic then social political then educational okay the pros are going to give their positions first to the class all right now the chart that you have in front of you what i want you guys to do is while the rest of the groups are presenting their findings their positions i want you to take down three different pieces of information that you hear specific pieces of information that you guys hear from the presenter all right because you re going to use this when you formulate your own response at the end of class to how you feel about you know the efficacy of reconstruction based on what you ve heard okay you re going to make your decision so you need to make sure that you have information down to support that okay to support your idea and make sure you re getting that from their presentations all right so we re going to go with economic first economic pro you have two minutes camille you it yeah all right everybody listen to camille okay so we came up with a thesis and it was reconstruction positively affected america economically by bringing a broader selection of products to the south and north and the north was trying to find ways to help the south with the 13th and alabama and mississippi and everyone they started mining for coal and iron and everything and so that helped their economies because they were able to make more money with that instead of just cotton and the north put a few restrictions on that but that still helped their economy for more products and the north manufactured more like grain and we talked about other things that weren t really economic that was about it that we could come up with okay thank you all right anti who is our speaker today okay grant go ahead all right so you mentioned the steel and iron and coal industries and yes those did help but at the same time the north industries the north s economy was growing and it was growing faster than the south and there was the whole economic deals with inflation where so the south basically was making more like a higher number of dollars but it essentially was the same work as before the war,0.0
one eighth plus one eighth is oh one eighth okay is she adding one eighth together a bunch of times where do you see that can you come up and show us you have to get seven of them okay katriana could you add that number sentence up above your picture also so i like how you re all thinking while she s writing this there s a couple different ways we can represent this i think anielli and lots a groups had their hand up were right that she did i can see she took seven pizzas and divided it into eight pieces for eight people and i also see where and when i talk to katriana she said well i got one eighth plus one eighth and one eighth and one eighth and one eighth how much is that gonna add up to equal she s got one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth seven eighths seven eighths okay and that s how much pizza she told us what about seven divided by eight a bunch a groups kept their hand down after anielli shared that number sentence but it s not a complete number sentence until we can finish that equation what would seven divided by eight come out to equal do you think talk at your group for just a minute again i think we re just a little bit unsure what are you thinkin for seven divided by eight let s come talk it over with this group you check with this group i ll check with this group what are ya ll thinkin up here well what do you see in her representation you see how many pizza s okay seven pizzas eight people and eight people did she divide those seven pizzas into eight groups okay so we ve just gotta figure out how much then that s gonna come out to equal i m not sure talk about it as a group you can draw it on the back okay yes thank you ma am okay thank you so much for talkin with your group what did you or someone at your group think again if we ve got seven pizzas divided by eight people katia we ve got 56 divided by eight because there s 56 pieces and it s kinda okay so you noticed there s and it s cut into eight eight slices so you were thinking something a little bit differently savannah we i thought the same way except i thought that it was gonna be 56 divided by seven because each one of them is shaded in and they re all going to eight people okay let me ask us all this i love that we re relating this back thinking about some of our math facts and how that can tie in and help us but what did katriana start with here what do you think the first thing she did was what did she do steven drew seven or eight pizzas did she draw seven pizzas or eight pizzas seven seven pizzas is that what she did first okay she drew out her seven pizzas so we wanna know or we need to know that that s what she started with what did she divide those pizzas into into eighths into eight we see she cut em into eight pizzas brennan i did i was thinking either 700 or seven tenths okay so we re thinking back to fractions i think since we don t have a definite answer we don t need to yet let s leave this kinda open ended but i m gonna circle it so that we remember to come back to it so we ve gotta a great number sentence that one thing katriana did was add up one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth and she got seven eighths and we re gonna keep thinking about i saw a bit of agreement that seven pizzas she divided by eight people but we need to figure out ladies how much that would mean each person gets so put a big arrow so as we continue let s keep that in our mind okay thank you can i have the person who put this one up in black faith was that you will you come tell us what you did and what you think the answer might be here how much pizza each person got well i knew there was eight soccer players so there were seven pizzas so i did seven pizzas then i divided six of em up in to fourths and then i numbered em all and then when i got to eight i started one two three back over again when i got to another eight i did it again but then i realized that there wasn t enough or more so i split the last pizza up into eighths and that equals up to eight people okay and that equaled up to eight people so how much pizza do you think each person gets well i think that each person would get at least one fourth and okay so let s write this up here so you said each person gets let s put it up in black how much like let s say person number 1 how much pizza do they get will you show us they would get one two three they would get three fourths okay and then one eighth three fourths and one eighth like this okay do you know how much that is all together that would that would equal up to four okay so let s think about this one for a minute do you have any questions for faith about how she figured this out okay i think she did a great job explaining her picture so she showed us where each person gets three fourths plus one eighth will you talk at your group how much is that how much is that total thank you if you wanna join a group good explanation okay group what do we think four twelfths you agree with her four twelfths how did you come up with four twelfths by adding those two together how did you add them together three plus one would equal four and then four would be the numerator because you added the two top numbers and if you added the two bottom numbers it would equal twelve for the denominator okay so is there a picture or is there a way that we could show this with pictures that that would come out to equal four twelfths see on the back of your paper once will you draw a representation of four twelfths how come because i thought that if the denominators were different we couldn t add them up directly oh so we tried to get the denominators the same what do we call that equal to fractions i like that your thinking back to remember your vocabulary i tried to tell katia that if it has a different number on the bottom then we re supposed to add the on the bottom to i don t know have we learned to do that before well no but i just thought about it and i ve been practicing okay so if we haven t learned it yet we ve gotta think about how are we gonna figure it out right okay so keep thinking it s okay that we re debating between a couple different answers just tryin to explain to each other why you re thinking four twelfths and why you re thinking something different i thought it was because whenever you add it up and the denominator okay so i understand where you got the four slices but what size are those slices would be my next question because we wanna make sure every soccer player gets the same amount cause i would be upset if i didn t get as much pizza as you did i like pizza okay okay well it says four twelfths so we re shading four do you have 12 pieces there we have one two three okay if i can have your attention back i know some of you are still discussing and doing a great job but i wanna make sure that we ve got time to get through the rest of our solutions before we re out of time for the day hailey if i can have you close the door again for us and can i hear what a couple of your groups came up with i heard three or four different things as i was going around three fourths hannah said each person gets three fourths of a pizza and one eighth faith said how much is that yes i m sorry faith said since ya ll sat next to each other i still mess that up three fourths and one eighth how much did you or your group think that came out to be nathan we came up with seven eighths seven eighths because when you take three fourths and then you take another circle that shows one eighth then you divide the three fourths into eighths then add the the ones that used to be three fourths and that equals seven eighths can you come up and show that to us i think i think i followed in my head but did you all have trouble making that picture in your head yes a little bit yeah can you show us you can draw it here or over here we ve got lots of room nathan you re right shhh okay let s see what he does okay can you step to the step to the side so everybody in the class can see you there you go and then if you divide that into eighths then you add one of the eighths then you add this over here it comes out to be seven eighths can i just get in agreement or disagreement somebody who had shared with us what do you think about what he just did i saw him draw three eighths at one pizza and one or three fourths of one pizza and one eighth of the next and then i saw him cut this one into eighths how many eighths was three fourths when you cut it six eighths and then he put one more eighth over and seven eighths what are you thinkin about that brazy i agree with him why because our group said that we know that four eighths is equal to twelve fourths is equivalent to seven eighths and his picture we can see that it s two and when he was workin it out we could see that it was right and so i agree with him okay brennan i agree with him but i have a different explanation okay one fourth is equal to two eighths but then you take oh i m sorry let me write this as you re saying it so we can follow it so you said one fourth is equal to two eighths okay so we multiplied the three and the numerator with three fourths okay by two which comes from the two eighths and it would equal up to six eighths plus that one extra eighth it would be seven eighths okay so you said three fourths is equivalent to six eighths six eighths okay and then just add the other one seven eighths okay so then you did six eighths plus one eighth equals seven eighths like that okay can i just see a quick on your remotes do you agree or disagree with nathan and brennan so a is i agree b i disagree or i m confused what s confused we ll just do a and b a is i agree i understand or b is i disagree or i m confused how are you feeling right now about what brennan and nathan just said they re two different explanations i just wanna see right now do you agree or disagree with what brennan and nathan just said and again they were saying that three fourths plus one eighth is gonna come out to equal seven eighths and they each kinda explained it a different way one with words and one with a picture need a couple more people to vote if they agree or disagree number three number eleven we need a vote from you please where is remote number three there it comes okay what do we what do we know by looking at this graph what do we know by looking at this graph thomas,0.0
what if it comes from like a polluted creek or something or some kind of bad water system in the ground number three i say crystal clear and filtered i said how dirty the water gets how good the water is for you it doesn t have stuff dying in it it s crystal clear and it doesn t smell okay class if we can pull back together please as a group i was hearing excellent discussions between each of the three questions and i think we have some very valuable points to go ahead and talk about so what we re gonna do is kind of create a little bit of a list up here to help us remind later when i go to show you something so we re gonna start again with that first question and i m looking for you to participate and share some of those questions together so it says again how do you know if water is safe or not and i heard wonderful responses so can i hear some of those please brandon please start us color and odor okay so you know if water is safe or not depending on again the color and the odor good what are some other responses brandon remember where you got it from like if it was in a creek that looks fine it s probably safe to drink but if it s from a polluted creek that has a really weird color to it or it s in a weird location don t drink it okay so i m commenting here i have it depends on the source you re getting it from and so if it s a creek that looks to be clean or clear then you know it s probably okay and if it looks to have like a weird color i think you mentioned again to it or polluted or in a weird location then maybe it s not safe all right what were some of your other responses jack um if it goes through a quality filter okay if it goes through a quality filter and jack can you maybe think of an example of a quality filter a culligan filter for the drinking water okay so a culligan filter that you can use to filter out the water okay good madeline there s no large pieces of trash or anything in the water okay so you can look for visible signs of large trash and madeline what was the second part of that nothing that looks unnatural in it okay so nothing that looks unnatural great anybody else any answers for number one again how do you know if it s safe or not lexi i think you had another answer that may have been covered up here what did you say when i was talking with your group about the smell okay the smell again the odor of it okay great brandon you thought of another one if there s something dead in it if there s something dead in it so again we re going based on those visual aspects of it good well we re gonna come back to that here in just a moment so we ll move on to number two when are times when the water might not be safe walker after an earthquake or another disaster okay so after an earthquake and walker can i have you expand a little bit what would be so significant after an earthquake or another disaster that would make the water not safe because maybe something fell in the water or i don t know i just heard that before okay so you heard it before and if something fell in the water did you happen to see at all in japan after the tsunami came through there do you remember any of those images yeah kinda they were different colors and yeah okay and i think i heard somebody else say that they remembered seeing a point that maybe we can add onto elvis at the beach at the beach what do you mean by at the beach there s different times where the water might not be safe okay can you think of a specific example like have you experienced a time when you weren t allowed to be at the beach when somethings dangerous in the water okay if something s dangerous in the water sometimes they might tell you that it s not safe to be there okay any other times that might make the water not safe amelia can you think of any times where the water might not be safe i have after storms like um walker did okay what are some things then because this is something i m hearing so far what are some things after the storm that might be in the water besides i think you said some stuff can fall in the water what are some of the things that might be in the water that would make it not safe aashi can you think of something that might get in the water um like tree branches or animals okay so tree branches and animals that s good can you think of anything else that might get in the water that maybe wouldn t normally be there kris trash trash okay can you think of a specific kind of trash lexi glass glass and what would be the danger of glass getting in the water it s sharp and can cut yourself okay so there s a chance of getting injured if you cut yourself what else think outside the box a little bit more what else could get in the water that you would not normally want in your water madeline plastic bags and then you can suffocate animals okay so plastic bags that they suffocate animals something along those lines elvis oil and gasoline oil and gasoline good brandon toxins toxins okay jack plastic six pack holders because it strangles the fish and everything okay now lets think i m glad you guys are all concerned about the fish and the animals and all of that but what about we as humans can you think of anything that would get in the water that would be potentially harmful to us afterward go ahead pesticides pesticides okay brandon fertilizer fertilizers elvis a car what is it again a car a car okay all right well we ll come back to those in just a minute so looking at we ve kind of come up with a list here of how you would determine if things are safe or not so then i guess my question would become if you look at it s color and you look at if it s in a source that looks safe or not how would you be able to determine if something is safe to drink so maybe that might change your perspective a little bit so is there a difference between being able to drink something and maybe being able to swim in something in fact let me give you just a minute to talk about that with your partner for a minute so my question to you again is it are there different things we should look for in water that we drink versus maybe water that we swim in or take a shower in and i want you to talk about that with your partner and jot down a couple notes about that so go ahead that s interesting to hear you saying shower water isn t as filtered as your drinking water our pool is safe they put a water cover over our pool so it was different at our pool they changed from too much chlorine can burn people s eyes so they changed it yeah definitely a bigger job but they put a small amount of chlorine in it so all the bacteria that s on us if you go swim in the pool it wouldn t matter as opposed to in the shower because it s different even if you do have a water cover still it could seep through and that s how they clean it when they open the pool it takes like a month because they have to go through the water thing and all the filters okay we ll come back together as a group one more time thank you all again i hear great discussions going on so let s talk about this there s some very neat ideas of whether you think something is safe to drink versus whether or not it s okay to shower or to swim in so what were some comments you were talking about in your smaller groups again i heard some great discussions going on mikenna what did your group talk about shower water isn t as filtered as drinking water okay so in their group they believe that shower water was not as filtered as what the water is that you drink in so if it s not as filtered where would your drinking water be coming from that maybe your shower water isn t coming from okay is there a reason that maybe you thought along sometime where the shower water is not as filtered as your drinking water no no okay it just makes sense to you that maybe the stuff that comes out of the tap to drink is not necessarily the same thing coming out of your pipes for the shower okay what were some other comments about that larry what did you guys talk about may i have your attention please would all spelling bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the spelling bee again all spelling bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the spelling bee thank you okay so larry to expand upon that and i think he brought up a really good point he said that maybe the water that you were you saying larry swimming or showering he was saying that the water we drink hold on just one second isaiah just one second okay good i wanted to make sure i wasn t saying it incorrectly so what he was saying is in other words when you shower or when you are going swimming that water is not necessarily going in your body you re not consuming that water so there would be a difference possibly between the water you re swimming in versus the water that you re drinking walker i said that you would swim in darker water than you drink or shower in okay so sometimes you think that the water you ve been in when you swim is darker so going back to the color difference that talked about here okay interesting lexi the shower water and the water that we drink i think is sort of the same but they go through a different process but if we go swimming at our community pool it s different because there s more chlorine and stuff so you have bacteria on you and you re just swimming you not really intaking it but at your house when you drink or take a shower it s different okay would you say that because i think it s probably safe to say you guys mostly agree that there is a difference between drinking water and water you would shower in versus water that maybe you would go swimming in so what are some of those differences what might be what might they have to do to that water lexi was talking about maybe it would have to be treated differently or that there would be chemicals added to it so can you think of what they would do to the water in a swimming pool versus water that you drink to make it different i think jack mentioned about filtering and mikenna also brought up the point about it being filtered different brandon well they put more chemicals in the swimming pool because there s gonna be more germs and when people swim in it so that will kill off the germs as in drinking water is not as much chemicals because there s not really any germs you re just drinking it so okay good so what i m hearing is the amount of something so would you all agree as a class if we were to drink swimming water would you die no no probably not right but the amount of the chemical that is in the water might be something that would cause some effects or cause some harm to you so do you think that there is chlorine in your drinking water because we said it s in the swimming pool probably to help kill off bacteria do you think that and i m hearing a little bit of a disagreeance here so i d love to hear your conversation in just a minute elvis what do you think there is chlorine in the drinking water but then they purify it so so they purify out the chlorine after they put the chlorine into the drinking water yeah okay good and isaiah what were you thinking about i think you were saying no that there isn t the chlorine my question is if there was chlorine in drinking water i mean you can purify it but it may still stay around that water then why would you drink it i mean sure it can knock out the bacteria and germs but why drink it if it has chlorine in it because that s not good for you okay and going back to the amounts of it and you re thinking that even the smallest amount might not be healthy for you to put in your system okay jack well for a normal tap system i think it s the last or second last step they do is they insert really small amount of chlorine into all tap water usually in a normal town and so then a lot of people have chlorine in their drinking water but for some people who have specialized filters for drinking water they re designed to filter out all of the chlorine so that it s mostly just water that they re getting so some people have a filter installed okay and would you be able to tell based on the color because that seems to be what a lot of people are using as their indicator of good water would you be able to tell just by the color whether or not there s a lot of chlorine in it maybe maybe not i don t know if this contributes to it but sometimes i look at my drinking water compared to the tap water and the tap water is a lot more foggy so i don t know if that s because the chlorine or because it s aerated or something but i don t know okay good thank you for sharing that elvis you can buy those little filters that you can screw onto your taps so that way it filters down the water i have one and it filters out tap water okay and it s filtering out more of the amount or maybe none of it at all okay let s go back oh go ahead madeline i would just like to say to isaiah s comment we sort of have to have chlorine in our water because there would be more bacteria if we didn t so there s a reason for it and it s not that much so it would do you less harm to have the chlorine in the water than to not have it okay so the benefits of what you re saying is that you would at least have to have a little bit to kill off the bacteria and that would outweigh the fact of you not having anything at all and then being exposed to maybe whatever is in the water that the chlorine is not killing off right okay very good let s look at we ve used again some criteria and let s look at that final question of what is your definition of water quality so in other words i think jordan i heard in your discussion could you read your answer for us one more time about what you think water quality is to you water quality is how good the water is for you to drink good how good the water is for you to drink can i hear another definition of water quality kris what did you decide how clean the water was how clean the water was okay and how would you determine if the water is clean or not what was your number one indicator when you drink it when you drink it okay so if you drink it and you know that it s clean then it has good water quality to it all right isaiah my definition of water quality is how much of the water is polluted and how much of the water is pure so polluted versus pure and then kind of a ratio of if it s polluted and more pure then it s better water quality okay rachel how about your definition of water quality we said that water quality was how much of the water is pure water and how much of it s polluted okay so going back to that same definition together as you all talked and ashani what did you think water quality would be how good the water is because some water it like tastes different you can tell okay so the taste have you ever experienced where water might taste a little different can you think of an example my aunt s house when we go to her house it s always different from our house and what kind of taste would you say it s gross it s gross water maybe back to when we were talking about well water in here versus the regular city water and it has a different taste to it so what we re gonna do is using your ideas so far you guys have told me again based on color and you mentioned about the smell of it and you ve mentioned about tasting the water so i have here three different liquids that i m going to go around and show you and on your paper you re going to determine if these liquids are safe or if these liquids are not and since we have already discussed that there s probably different qualities for your water versus the water you drink versus the water that you swim in or the water that you are going to take a shower in so when you comment upon whether those liquids are safe or not i think it would probably be a wise decision to comment if you think they re safe to drink versus safe to shower or to swim so i ll start here with cup letter a so you can go ahead and mark a on your paper and then i will walk around so you can just take an observation of the liquid and you determine again if you think that it is safe all right so what do you all think logan do you think that this is safe to drink so if i gave this to you right now you d go ahead and drink it because it would be safe no no what would make you change your answer then,0.0
a prediction on the weather temperatures okay so maybe they can predict something that s going to happen yes okay so based on the information that you collected is there any information let s say you could go out the next day what do you think based on what you saw what do you think might happen the next day it might go back down into the 30s or the 20s okay and what makes you say that because there s more 30s and 20s then there are 50s and 40s and then there was a large spike so okay so it got warmer but you re saying because most of them were cooler it might get cooler again yes okay so you re making a conclusion you re using your data to support that shaun what are you thinking i was thinking that maybe they might want to track it because maybe weather can not evolve over time but how much it s changing and predict what s gonna happen okay so you re thinking like a meteorologist or a scientist might make a forecast make a prediction so you re thinking sort of like hava and were your temperatures similar to her or were they very different because you might have been at two different stations what do you think might happen on the next day i think it will drop down to the 30s because i see that it s dropping down it s going up and then it s dropping down i think it s gonna go up and then drop down again okay and it does look like you had kind of a trend here so what do you think if you had a day that went down do you think it might go up again mhm might peak up again okay is there anybody else who s looking at their data thinking of what else might happen with that temperature change madison are you looking at something yeah what do you think well with the wind speed and it would be like 8 5 for quite a few times a day sort of shot up into so what do you think that was indicating that it was a very windy day a very windy day okay so you guys some of you look at your charts if you were madison was in group a and can you make a connection or h madison can you make a connection to your wind speed really spiked on that same day did you have any difference or did you have something happen in your temperature well the temperature was about 20 degrees and because of the wind was making it cooler okay so you re saying that you think that the wind also has an effect on the temperature mhm okay so was there anybody else in group h that recorded that sort of thing you had a big windy gust you had a very windy day your temperatures went down did you have a similar thing happen to you hava yes yes okay so you guys why would we want to track something like not only temperature but also the wind speed jada so that they can know what tomorrow s gonna be like or what another day s gonna be like or for them to know if it s gonna rain or okay what the temperature is gonna do so they want to think maybe more you guys now your thinking jada you re even putting together precipitation so maybe there s a consequence of precipitation no with low temperature and maybe heat can evaporate some water and then the next day it can get dropped down and get colder okay so maybe a connection with the precipitation temperature those sorts of things okay katie o what are you thinking i would think that they wouldn t just want to track the temperature but they d also do the wind speed because wind speed can change how what the temperature is and how it changes so why do you think wind speed makes a difference with temperature what are you making the connection with what s your evidence well wind speed i think would change like it wouldn t make it warmer it would make the temperature feel colder okay so why do you think that because the wind well you go out to the playground a lot right yeah and when you guys are on the playground and it s really windy is it warm no okay so maybe are you thinking like when you go out there and it s really windy and you don t have a coat does it feel cooler to you yes does it on sometimes yeah alright so maybe they re maybe a prediction and so you were saying they so are you thinking scientists and meteorologists are trying to put those two together those phenomenons yeah okay so katie o let me ask you if this was a hypothesis that you were saying if it s windier then it may be cooler you guys agree as a class okay thumps up thumbs down what do you guys think yes no maybe a little bit there alright josh what are you thinking i was saying that if people are always looking at the temperature so we know what s gonna happen when it s gonna happen what we can expect what we need to do okay so we re taking that forecast even further maybe so let me kind of pose another question real quick before i keep going you guys let me ask you you guys remember when you went on the computer and you watched the hurricanes and you tracked the hurricanes so was that data indicating the speed or the movement of the hurricane yes yes so does a meteorologist even track something like that to be able to maybe help people yes okay so do you guys remember when the meteorologist came to visit us you guys remember that and he really talked to us a lot about tornadoes didn t he but he was also giving us situations of how we know a tornado might be forming right so yeah does that make sense that that might be another reason that they start tracking so think and talk to your shoulder partner besides a hurricane what else might they track to like josh was saying to prepare us for to let us know so talk to your shoulder partner the weather because some people can know what to like my hands yeah or like tornadoes yeah or maybe even thunderstorms or the normal weather very intense temperatures we can already know maybe even like snow because that can be a really heavy and or kind of get everywhere like snowbound us or it could like be rain snow hail so what do you think emily what else can we determine snow storm or a tornado or a earthquake so what were you thinking first alexis and then we ll come back to nick i was thinking either a tornado or blizzard snowstorm okay so what kind of weather do you think they re tracking in order for us to be prepared about weather what do we wind wind maybe and temperature snow okay so if we re looking for just a tornado maybe temperature maybe the wind yeah what kind of wind is it is it cold or hot yeah okay hot and cold fronts and then we were thinking about what else nick i would say a flood because maybe maybe the clouds are coming and there s going to be a bunch of rain like you said that we could get a flash flood okay so and are you making that connection to maybe our area that had a fire and so we have to think about would there be because it can t absorb the moisture okay so that s another idea so how would meteorologist or scientists how would they austin how would they predict maybe a flood happening what do you think they d use what kind of information would they be looking at well if a rainstorm was coming because that rain would cause a flood okay so a large amount of rain that would make sense yes or snow or even if we had a lot of snow so if we had large amounts of snow what could we possibly be warning people of if that was the case alexis what do you think stay inside or wear warm clothes if you go somewhere or something so they don t get so cold okay so would you guys say would one of you formulate some sort of a hypothesis about snow coming if there was if there was enough cold air and some times when it s raining it starts to hail and then it starts to sometimes it starts to snow so if there s cold weather and clouds then we might have consequences snow or rain or yeah of hail or heavy snow yeah okay so we d wanna keep that in mind and does that seem to happen in our areas sometimes sometimes and sometimes when we make that forecast and then maybe it doesn t come that happened on saturday okay so if it does come what happened on saturday austin i think it was really humid out at first mhm and then it started to rain and then a lot of times usually rain starts out as ice and then it melts and it started to get colder and then it started to hail so then we have the consequences of a hailstorm didn t last saturday did it start out really nice first yeah yeah and then also happened yesterday too because when i got picked up it was nice and warm and everything and then when i got to my house it was all windy and then it started raining so i was like i thought it was supposed to be hot today right so is it possible to use forecasting information and still be wrong yes well in the weather book it explains the rating of tornadoes so i m thinking tornadoes or something to track like the wind speed if it s gets too crazy it get like wind miles per hour and how bad it is like if the wind speed s really high then it can cause a tornado like the scale so they use that information we were just talking and showing the things that they might be using for information that they re collecting to do what now to give to the what they re doing it to give us warnings they can t tell us that a tornado s happening prior to it right so they have to warn us about them and so i think they collect the data from that to do that okay and then reagan what were you connecting that with i was connecting it with a blizzard or snow storm because if there s a delay and you need to go somewhere you can know that there might be delays and if you re gonna go outside you need to wear a coat a heavy coat okay so how do we respond how do we react to it good okay you guys i was going around and i heard some excellent conversations and so i think you guys made strong connections with your data and probably with your meteorologist visit what they were telling you and how you were putting that information together so i want you guys to go ahead and pick up your pencils and write underneath your graphs i want you to answer this question what does your data tell you so write there on underneath your graph or write on your graph you could even write right in the middle of your graph i want you to write what is your graph actually telling you so is it telling you that you had a series of cold days make your prediction so go ahead and take a minute or two write down what your data tells you and then what changes did you observe what was the most significant change that you observed if at all possible while you re writing that you can come up with a hypothesis about your data it could either be your wind speed or it could be your temperature write down what it is that actually took place yeah you want to answer the question what does your data tell you what changes did you observe on either graph or you can even write a sentence that combines the two of them together so mine says i added a little more it says it is telling me all about my wind speed and how it s going high or low or high what does your say austin mine is it had cold and hot days and it went from 44 degrees fahrenheit to 20 degrees fahrenheit so go ahead just like alexis and austin shared go ahead and share with your face partner this time so that you change who you re talking to so emily and madison you can also share what you wrote it tells me that some times it can be hot and then go down to a little bit colder and then it goes back into hot yeah that s what i was kinda saying when i told the wind speed because it s not always wind speed yeah it s not always wind speed but most of the time when we took it it was mostly in the winter so it would mostly go down like it was 40 then it was 25 then it was 20 and then it was 30 and then it was 30 and then it was 40 and then it was 50 so that s what so john what did you figure out from your data i figured out that it was colder the week we were doing this okay and the wind speed was not very high okay oh yeah yeah so you were in an area that maybe was more protected by the wind do you think yeah we were behind the building oh okay so that might of had an effect too yeah okay did you draw any conclusions from that i forgot to do that okay great braden tell us a little bit about what you observed from your data well i observed that i did not get much wind speed okay so where was your station were you at a protected area as well yes okay so that definitely had an effect didn t it yes so as a meteorologist would you want to be able to put your anemometers somewhere where you know you re gonna catch the wind yep okay so that was a really important lesson right there too so what about your thermometer readings since those weren t dependent necessarily on being protected from the wind what can you observe from your thermometer reading well that it was and then on tuesday and wednesday it got colder okay so it got colder on tuesday and wednesday so if you were making a prediction what do you think would happen on this day based on your data do you think it s gonna change stay the same what do you think stay the same seems like it s gonna stay the same because you have that pretty consistently yeah okay alright tariq what do you find from your data what did you discover observing i noticed that for my temperature i had up and down weather so your temperature was would you say it was fluctuating yeah okay why do you think that was happening because well it was cold on the days we went out but where we were the sun was kind of coming towards us at the times we went out so do you think that had an effect on your thermometer as well yeah hm okay so then that s another thing as a meteorologist you might want to think about where your thermometer is right are you just getting straight sun okay was there something else you were gonna say about your wind speed well my wind speed on monday we got a lot and on thursday we got a lot on the other two days we didn t get any wind not too much okay then then i also had go ahead all three of us were in the same group you were in the same group alright so there you go and i also had to say that my wind speed was never below 20 degrees you to pull out your sheet right there that you have about your temperature on the moon i want to ask you one more question and i want you to think about your temperature on the moon now did you actually go to the moon to get your data no no but let s look at the scientists who recorded that data why was it important for them to find out the temperature on the moon and as you look at it did it change very much so why was it important and did it change very much okay jaime i thought that on one of the missions that it was different temperatures like it would be and then it dropped down to about 200 okay and so you re specifically talking about the day yeah okay and so you re saying is it pretty similar is that you re saying pretty similar but not very okay so the main thing is that it didn t stay the same okay it didn t seem to stay the same no okay and then we had not only day temperature but was the other temperature that we looked at on the moon night nighttime okay so what were you thinking about that shaun i kind of had the same data as jamie did okay because it switched every single mission so on mission 11 it was well 200 and about 13 degrees okay and it just kept on going down and up each mission so it changed significantly each mission,0.0
can you make some shadows i see light how will you make a shadow how are you making a shadow how are you making a shadow alicia my hands what is your hand doing making a shadow how is it making a shadow i don t know how is it making a shadow brandon because your hand is stopping the light your hand is stopping the light and it s small cause your hand is far away from your body and more light comes around your hand what happens if you move it close to the light it has it big because it stops more light because it stops more light it s stopping more light you re right let s go see what these guys are doing what are you guys doing blocking the light from the light in there you re blocking the light how are you blocking it we re going forwards and backwards to make it little so i see your shadow is changing how is it changing because you re closer to the light and then you re when you get close it gets bigger it gets bigger and when you re far it gets littler okay why does that happen what s happening when you re down here it gets big it gets bigger why does it get bigger what happens to the light the light can t go through your hand and and and it s blocking it it s blocking more light what happens over there then it s blocking a little bit of light okay so more light gets around it right alright very good can you guys make different shadows it s a turkey that looks like the red nosed reindeer the red nosed reindeer how are you changing your shadow you have to make shapes of the animals i don t know what to make that s okay make anything you want you guys go ahead make em big and small and i ll be back in a little bit duwant is helping you duwant what s happening over here doing some measuring what are you measuring how come you guys are measuring down here and not in the window because are you able to see the box how come you re not measuring the fifth one where s the sun the sun is on the other side other side of the building way over there so we can t measure the shadow sticks today can we that s why you re making shadow sticks on the ground okay show me a shadow stick okay bristava you can handle the light what can you do can you hold the stick up for us julie to make a shadow okay can you do the measuring okay go ahead and measure it put your hand down here so we can see the top can we measure that stick no we re gonna measure the shadow you wanna measure the stick first and then compare it to the shadow okay you gotta hold that real still don t you is your light high or low low it s lower what happens if you put it lower what happens to the shadow it turns big it grows it grows it gets longer what if we put it high it s gonna be fat gonna be short is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick i need to you to measure it okay let s record it you measure the shadow measure the shadow whoops scuse me let s measure the shadow measure the shadow is that long enough or do you need another hold it still bristava is that long enough is the shadow longer or the stick longer let s compare there s the shadow measurer and there s the stick what do you notice it s the same size it s the same size it sure is what if you did it down here though would it be the same size if you put the ball down here no the shadow would be much longer wouldn t it good work guys keep measuring try a different stick use that pointer stick or another stick here s a stick here s some more sticks for you to try i m done with these things already it s okay okay what are we doing can you guys guess what that is scissors how did you know it was scissors because the shadow okay the shape of the shadow told you didn t it she put on some blocks okay no oh she says no it s not blocks is she tricking you yeah sometimes the shape is hard to tell can you guess adam no take a look at this one adam take a look at this one oh nope not from up here what do you think that is know what this is bryce what is that one can you tell from the shape what this one is gluestick a gluestick you re right good guessing how could you tell shadow of the lid you saw the shadow of the lid good job bryce s turn okay now are you guys gonna play the takeaway game okay remember she s gonna put a whole bunch of objects on there sit down and you grab a good long look and then close your eyes and she ll take one away and you ll have to guess what shadow is missing okay alright what are we doing over here guys what are we doing you re making shadows shadows you re checking out different materials yeah okay so what is that one shelby what did you find out about that one goes through what goes though what goes through the light the light goes through so does it make a shadow yes which part of it makes a shadow boys and girls check your voices please thank you this part okay that thick part makes a shadow doesn t it what about the thin parts doesn t make a shadow does it the light goes right through what else did you try what are you trying takori tell me about it show me why don t you try this trayshawn but wait takori was trying something just a minute what have you got takori a tissue it s what a tissue a tissue is the light going through it or did it stop the light stopped the light it stopped the light so it made a shadow didn t it did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow a dark one okay trayshawn your turn what are you trying the box is it stopping the light get back here so you can see put it down here can you see it what do you see about it it s making a shadow which part is making a shadow the whole thing is that a dark shadow or a light shadow a dark shadow is this part dark or light light okay why is this part light becuase it is a light shadow can t hear you babe because it s a light shadow why is it a light shadow why isn t it a dark shadow what s happening to the light some of the light going through it mm hmm what do you think cooper what s making that shadow um the light okay the light is making the shadow what are we using what is this a box okay is it clear or colored clear okay so what happens to the light it goes through okay it goes through it doesn t it so it only makes a little bit of a shadow good job did you guys write the things over here did you find anything new to write down let s try that shelby you and cooper come over here and try that okay cooper you may go to the bathroom what do you see shelby sorry you see a light shadow why is it light cause it goes right through is any part of that dark this part that part why do you think that part s dark cause it has a wrapper the wrapper and what s the wrapper doing to the light it s stopping the light and it s making a shadow exactly very good shelby thank you go right here okay what s our time we have two minutes left we might wanna go back and see hey what d we find out raja what are we doing here measuring what s your shadow doing can you change your shadow how do you change your shadow by moving by moving by moving the object how else could you change your shadow what about the light what would you do with the light move it move it i ll hold your stick and you move the light how is your shadow changing getting bigger what else could you do move your light some more move it up or down ooh what happened to the shadow it got shorter oh now what s happening got longer didn t it this is making a shadow that s easy to see look at that shadow when the light is high the shadow is shorter short and when the light is low the shadow is alright now measure that measure that how many cubes lie on that shadow one two three four five six seven is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick longer or shorter than the stick the same oh it s the same i think our,0.0
confusing for people to understand but we re looking at density today we re looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area so if you flip over to the back of your paper you ve got that little box at the top and it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density if you could write down the definition of density in your box i would appreciate that the amount of matter when i say stuff like when we were learning about solids liquids and gases at the beginning of the year stuff is matter so the amount of matter that s in a certain area is an object s density it s not its mass it s its density so the marble is more dense than the styrofoam ball okay so now that we know the word density we re going to start using the word density for the next part the amount of stuff packed in a certain area or the amount of matter the marble had more matter in that small area than the styrofoam ball the styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes making that matter more spread out less dense krayla yes right now okay all right so that was simple i want you to go ahead and put a c over your 10 at the top of this if you haven t and i want you to take a look at the part one on your paper yesterday we looked at how pressure could effect the mantle but now we need to look at something different i want you to answer number one and two first and then we ll talk about it this is just what you know before you come in my room to get you into the lesson so number one wants to know list a few things that you have seen float before number two wants to know what do you think might cause these things to float so first just make a little list of two three things that you ve seen floating before and then tell me on number two if it s a hypothesis you may not know for sure that s fine but what do you think causes them to float nathan are we allowed to write both yeah yeah so right now you re just going to make a little list on number one and then number two you re going to tell me what do you think actually causes these things that you wrote down to be able to float we re going to start with that first this is just to get us thinking about what we re doing today one and two please what do you think causes them to float you might not be sure of the answer to number two but i still want you to make a hypothesis you don t have to write i think because but you can tell me what you think causes that number two s going to be harder than number one yeah let s take four things tell me four things that you ve seen float before we ll take four because we can probably sit here and name like 100 cole give me one ice cubes ice cubes sadie boat a boat alex shoes shoes and emily dog toy dog toys okay now we know things can float and that s great but what do you think causes these things to float why do you think dog toys and a boat and ice cubes and things like that why are they are going to be able to float ebony what do you think the air in them the amount of air that s in them anybody else dylan they are less dense okay sean surface tension surface tension little air pockets that are in them okay air pockets i was thinking like the less density inside of it okay alright we re going to take a look at that today so you ve got a kind of idea we re going to look at what causes something to sink and what effects if something floats alright we have two parts that we are going to be going to our last stations for so let s take a look at part two last station observation you have two setups at your lab station you have a black tray that has three objects in it you ve got a bouncy ball a marble and a styrofoam ball alright you also have a setup at your lab station that has liquids in cups this is for part three alright i don t want you touching this stuff yet we re going to come back later and you re going to look at that stuff i don t want any of the cups knocked over i don t want any of the objects put into the cups okay these two things are separate your black tray and the piece of paper with the cups are separate what you re going to do first is use the black tray and the objects in it you re going to tell me with the marble the bouncy ball and the styrofoam ball if we were to put these in water which we are going to test them but if we were to put these in water do you think these objects would sink or float so you just go through and if you want you can just write an f or an s you re going to say what you think and i want you to wait until you get to your lab stations so you can pick them up feel them to see that might make a difference in your guess then i also want you to tell me why while you are at your lab station float or sink in water and why you re not going to do the did it actually float because we re going to look at that when we come back these are our results so you re going to do the first two columns float or sink why float or sink why float or sink why then we are going to come to that and we are going to come back and we re going to do an observation together so these two columns have got to be filled out before you get back to your seats got it let s go marble sink rubber float rubber float styrofoam float the marble will probably sink it s heavy it has no air in it bouncy ball the bouncy ball probably can float yeah i mean it s not light it s gonna float bouncy ball same thing bouncy ball heavy marble heavy with no air pockets no this one will definitely float because it s lightweight and it has these little pores this bounces a lot his bounces a little bit and this bounces not at all yeah but this one but this one if this one can float then why not think that one could float okay if you don t go with your group that s okay but you still need to a connection if you are finished before the timer goes off you need to come back to your seat this will float this will fall fail if you finish you need to come back to your seats you guys all finished i want to go ahead and take a look before we see the results before we look at the results and test this i want to see what we think so first off let s start with the marble since it s at the top raise your hand if you think the marble will float okay so we re all together on this one it s not going to float who can tell me why they re thinking it s not going to float we ll take like three guesses three explanations jc it s heavy with no air pockets heavy with no air pockets good frayla it can t capture air it can t float can t capture air can t float alright and emma heavy and solid heavy and solid alright now what about the bouncy ball raise your hand if you think this is going to float alright there s a mix what that s heavier than the marble well let s hear somebody give me an explanation for why it would float if you guessed float tell me why you thought that sean because there s air inside okay there s air inside alex i dropped it in the pond and it still floated bouncy ball floated in the pond when you did it before ali i ve seen it happen okay you ve seen it happen now some of us said it would sink why did you say it would sink matt weaver because it s heavy it s heavy frayla okay jared okay so prior experience now last one is our styrofoam ball float raise your hand alright somebody give me a reason why it s going to float we re all together on this one too we all agree the marble is going to sink we all agree the styrofoam ball is going to float matt cook it s light and has air pockets it s light and has air pockets alex you re talking alot of things the pond was last time okay frayla it s very lightweight okay alright let s test it out we re just going to test it out upfront here so i m just going to use this big beaker what do we want to see first marble bouncy ball alright record sink for your actual i guess we ll do bouncy ball we ll just go in order alright bouncy ball ready the moment of truth and styrofoam ball yeah a different bouncy ball didn t float but you saw the bouncy ball i was using right yeah so it was fair right yeah very simple but let s take a look at what s going on for number four i d like you to tell me i want you to answer first and then we ll discuss what i d like you to tell me why do you think some of these objects were able to float while others were able to sink and i want you to be specific at the beginning i asked you the same question on number two in prior knowledge why do you think some of these things float i want you to revisit that question again so why do you think the marble and the bouncy ball sank and the styrofoam ball was floating i want you to be specific on number four i want you to answer first on your paper and then we re going to share okay what kinds of things did we say for number four now that we ve looked at this in a different way before i just asked you to think of things in your past that you ve seen float now we ve looked at our marble our bouncy ball and our styrofoam ball what did you say nick bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up and it was too heavy okay anybody else say anything nick said bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up so it sank anybody say something different ebony density and buoyancy all right what do you mean density and buoyancy okay frayla i said that some objects had air holes and some were just solid okay now let s think of this in a different way we ve got this really small marble and we ve got a much larger styrofoam ball so normally if something s smaller you think it s going to be lighter it should float something heavier this is much larger but it didn t sink if i have one book if i m carrying one book versus carrying five books that s different because five books are bigger than one book so what is going on with the amount of stuff in the marble and the amount of stuff in the styrofoam ball is it the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space does the marble have the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space that the styrofoam ball does which one has more stuff more matter in a smaller space i want you to talk with the person sitting next to you for one minute okay so we ve done this before okay so marble s number one styrofoam ball two which object has more stuff more matter packed in a smaller space on the count of three right here marble one styrofoam ball two one two three marble good marble so let s write that down this is pretty much what number five is asking you so when comparing the marble to the styrofoam ball which one has more mass more matter more stuff in a smaller amount of space which we call volume that would be the marble alright people today if you flip over to the next part i ve heard the word density a couple times and density is kind of,0.0
what i need you to do is you re going to be looking at both sets of data the one from october in the morning and the one from last week in the afternoon so i want you to work with your shoulder partners okay and the first thing i want you to look at this table you can do all three isabella you can come sit right here you re gonna work with your shoulder partners and i m just gonna take a second and i want you to see what is common what is in common how is the data aligned okay so i want you to work with your shoulder partners want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data okay where are you all standing what is the same between those two days you re looking from this day to this day overall what is the the heat that was trapped inside the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on and the black soaks in the heat so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers it traps it into okay y all figured out about the black look at your other you have three other kind of solar water heaters look there see what other types you can find what did y all find out the black cover covers it okay the black cover it s highest on both sheets on both sheets and what did you say white is the lowest and white uncovered is whites are lower than blacks and white uncovered is the lowest okay okay okay everyone find some similarities okay if you can hear me clap once if you can hear me clap twice okay just one thing don t tell me all the things that you have found the same table four what did you find that was the same in those sets of data elijah only one went down okay which one went down white uncovered okay so you saw that white uncovered went down what s another scientific word for going down everybody decrease okay so white under decrease in both okay what else did you find alex that the rankings were the same for each one okay and when you re talking about the rankings what are you meaning like white uncover had decreased the most uh huh um white covered was was really toward the middle uh huh black uncovered was also was the next one and black covered was the last one in order from the heat okay does everyone agree yes you all see the same thing now what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered what does that mean justin that black absorbed more heat okay that black maybe absorbed the most and what did the white do everybody it reflected it reflected or anthony what were you gonna say absorbed the least absorbed the least because it was reflecting now okay that was the easy part now i want you to look at your graphs and i want you to try to figure out things that are different okay things that are different this is a little tricky okay so you work with your partner try to figure out the things that are different okay okay and how does that relate to the results look at these results and how are these results different okay and so you have a wider range than you do the width okay so what were you saying now that i think that the they are so seperated out the first time we did it than last week okay girls what do y all think i think here it s like up now think about why it would be a lot closer ooh okay okay well let s take he said hotter the morning what was our temperature 24 24 and the afternoon what is so think about what y all talking about okay y all ready to report out okay if you can hear me clap once if you can hear me clap twice okay different give me one thing that was different stephanie they all got different angles okay the lines are different angles you re right what else chloe at 10 30 a m all of them had all of temperatures were higher as well as to the 2 30 p m higher temps in morning okay um what else kristin can you think of something else what do you think nick there s different air temperature okay there s a different air temperature okay what else just looking at the overall graph justin just looking at just the picture of the graph how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon all of the temperatures went got decreased in the in the um at 2 30 okay and when you say decrease which graph looked like this the morning or the afternoon the morning the morning which one looked like this the afternoon okay so overall the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon now why do you think that could be why do you think that could be kristen because it s like on the side oh okay here s our school okay this is where we did our experiment and kristen s saying that the morning time the sun s here okay where was the sun in the afternoon anthony it was like barely okay okay semijah it was in the clouds okay it was sometimes it was going behind the clouds where was it alex where was it in the sky you don t remember behind the school okay behind the school so this was our morning experiment and this was our afternoon experiment okay and did we get different kinds of data because what was truly pretty much the same between both days besides the sun what was the air temperature in the morning 25 25 okay so our air temperature stayed the same but the thing that was different was what where the sun was where the sun was okay so thinking about that we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school okay a solar water heater installed at the school so what other do y all know a solar water heater a hot water heater in your house okay when you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water how do you think that water s heated does anyone know peyton you have the water in your well you have a water heater in your garage or um okay it s in your garage but what s heating that water the sun no,0.0
why do they keep getting colder why do they keep getting warmer they add water to it maybe they add water to it okay what else the thermometer what about the thermometer they could have lights lights well did they turn off the lights afterwards okay at this point at that point maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it the thing is ultimately are we gonna know what they did unless i was video taping you during that whole process there are a couple things i wanna point out here in a second i think several of the ideas are possibilities what happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially what do you need to do as soon as you put it in there what do you need to do do you immediately start taking readings yes everybody agrees we immediately start taking readings as soon as we put it down in there like the first second we start taking readings we take a thermometer put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings like what s the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point okay so we need a starting point what were you going to say if you put it in there like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature it wouldn t change immediately yes so it goes 22 21 19 18 it s going down so what could have been the issue here they took it at the very beginning good good they just didn t wait long enough look at this one i saw this in one particular group because by the way you guys realize you were doing some very very different things right as we were doing and collecting this data there were some major differences what could have happened what was going on here just the obvious stuff observation what s the difference in the pattern yes ma am the hot water is like consistent like it s just gonna stay at the current temp hot water stays hot right cold water is doing what increasing in temperature it s increasing in temperature the room temperature water is doing what it stays the same with this same group i just happened to catch this cold water luke warm water the person was doing this this is the warm water oh laughs body heat keeping it warm insulating it what was happening transfer of heat we re gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks this doesn t seem like a big deal right i mean would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this you ve gotta start thinking like scientists though because that could be a huge deal if we re doing something with temperature right okay good well the obvious or the observation what s going on with the cold water it s increasing it s increasing okay luke warm water staying the same the hot water it s getting cold it s getting cold okay what s different from the first slide yes the hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water did it actually happen to somebody did it actually happen yeah let s do this first let s go back to here what word would you use to describe what s going on here what s all this heading towards room temperature it s all headed towards room temperature there s a fancy word that starts with an e we may have talked about this last year the fancy word the idea there s a word i want you to walk away with the word is equilibrium okay how does this show equilibrium rebecca how does this show equilibrium with the hot water how does this show equilibrium rebecca it s sierra it all goes toward the same it s kind of like the hot is increasing and it s temperature the hot is what i m sorry i meant the cold the cold is increasing in it s temperature and then it s going towards the room temperature it s going towards room temperature the hot is decreasing in temperature and it s going towards the room temperature also is this what we would expect all right so what happened because i don t have any idea what happened here yes in some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out so maybe that one cup was under a lot of air we do have some powerful air vents what do you guys think is that that s a huge amount any other ideas yeah i think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature down for a hot cup is it possible there s human error here and they just they looked at the wrong thing maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot so there s mixing the water thermometers maybe just read them wrong so you guys think some kind of human error then yes yes let s go back to this and let s go to the next step kind of like what we ve done in the past i want you to think of this at an atomic level a molecular level what s happening here in order to do that we re gonna play with bbs i ve got enough sets of bbs here each group is gonna have a set of bbs all right so group up a little closer together alright so you two maybe go around you guys here s what i want you to do within your group one half have one set actually the two of you can marcus good here s what i want you to do the bbs will be what atoms atoms and molecules okay are atoms and molecules just sitting no when we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower faster when we take away energy they re going to go slower or rather than take away when they release it i m gonna give you a couple minutes i want you to talk within your groups i want you to be able to do three things i m gonna call people up here in a second i m gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your bbs i want you to be able to simulate the top line the middle line and the bottom line so getting cooler room temperature staying the same and getting warmer i also want kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium all right talk to each other real quick some are getting cooler some are getting hotter some are staying the same temperature and how would you show equilibrium i ll give you about a minute or two all right everybody take a look at your bbs hands off bbs i got a volunteer what were the bbs again atoms atoms and we re trying to show what movement towards equilibrium movement towards equilibrium what energy energy and movement how those go together energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it okay everyone take a look at the chart here s the graph show me the top line and tell me what you re doing make it faster because it s hotter it decreased because it s going down and getting less heat okay so it s gonna start the bbs are going to start going fast and then slowing down slowing down could you show us yeah we re in an awkward spot getting warmer the bottom part of that chart at first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it s getting warmer thank you i m gonna do room temperature i think room temperature would be this and it stays the same kenny what well it s gotta be moving right room temperature would just be this and i have to do what oh i probably should have picked the same group the two of you working together how could you show us equilibrium of going towards equilibrium she s going to do cold okay and you re going to do hot okay good now time out what did you do or were you not done i started out fast and she started out slow why did you start out fast because i was hot and you were cold cold and lauren what did you do the same speed which was getting close to equilibrium show us one more time good who disagrees nobody good thank you here we go keep going a couple more things real fast most of you guys had this going about six seven eight nine anywhere from six seven to 15 minutes of data if we did this for an hour what would this look like they would eventually all be on the same line for a while and it would be pretty boring so this would keep going well what would be the lowest point room temperature this would be the highest point then this would still continue the same what s the word equilibrium here s how all this started this whole lab that you guys put together and created it s a demo here s how it all started i asked you a question yesterday a couple days ago jar bag with some water in it scarf although i told you gloves and then aluminum foil we came up we felt all four of these things and you made a predic well the question was if we put these outside left them there overnight you look outside your window,0.0
has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees why do you think it s more light around him i don t know just to show that to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture what is the dark force symbolizing why is it a dark force why isn t it like a bright light yeah i don t know it kind of reminds me of what jack said dante started going through the forest it kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff hell s not a very bright place so it reminds me of that one thing the light and religious paintings jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he s pure or more religious but what d you say i said but dante isn t pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn t as pure as like jesus okay so i want to come your statement in a moment because kailyn had something to offer why do you say he s not pure is there any indication that he s not pure well it s kind of an inference because he s man we all assume that the purity is in god or jesus or buddha or whatever he s not because he s man and men have faults women have faults a human being is just not divine i guess but it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously so he kind of is the most pure one not like godlike but he is more pure than the rest i believe so do you think that s why dante went to hell in the first place to go see all the bad people do you think he was going there to learn a lesson or going there to prove that he was right because remember this is a fictional this is fictional so can a character cause you re right we infer that man is sinful but can a fictional character be perfect can be flawless can be sinless and if so is dante trying to go a different way of inference is he trying to infer that he is from what you ve said that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he s not already so can a fictional character be pure one of the questions i think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent i kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything like a wake up call you re going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways they were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing he was considered a fraud by the other team i guess side so i think it s more of a like he s going to there to see what happens when you don t be the best you could be i guess who judges where you go is it the devil or is it a higher power i thought it was the gods that judged that are there gods in this story do we ever hear much about the gods we aren t sure about the gods yeah really who judges where all these people go cause they re talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that we didn t really read the hell part as opposed to the yeah yeah so maybe in the other books it would explain where the gods are and you said who judges where they go and everything technically we don t know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating brutus cassius and judas but in the book on page 41 lines 8 9 minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go so he s kind of like boss of hell sort of forty one lines eight and nine i have a question are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell that s what i find too meaningful but in their own perspective they are different individual yeah so do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far what do you think depends on how far you go down like the pain increases one of my questions are are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do i think it s what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are i think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes couldn t it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life for instance in limbo all these babies that had died and weren t baptized are now there but they hadn t really hurt anybody so they re not being quite as punished as let s say judas who s in the center of hell having his head gnawed on he caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done so it depends on who they put it on yeah so if they just keep it to themselves like gouging out the eyes that s not really hurting anyone else right where s the gouging of the eyes where did you just pull that from what piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out oh i m sorry i got confused oedipus oedipus he punished himself for it in a weird way but do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn t torture other people think before you respond think about it because i want you to respond to this this is huge i want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we re going to do for the end of the year okay so write down your question mainly she has brought up just like i heard you guys doing with these pictures a different text didn t you bring up the odyssey with this yeah do you want me to write oedipus specifically yep write down the gouging of oedipus eyes where would oedipus have ended up in dante s inferno okay so pretty much yep and i want you guys to answer and then i ll move on and come back i love how you bring in another text that s one reason i brought this picture in so you guys hit on that i love that you brought this up this is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we ve read and you have to develop a theme so right there s a good start okay you ready for them to answer it yeah okay the pain that oedipus caused wasn t intentional so i don t really think he d be punished as harshly i do believe that he d be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and i believe a couple other people during that fight so he would be punished but i don t believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment cause really he didn t knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally so really he shouldn t be punished for something that he didn t know he was doing but he still killed somebody he did kill somebody and the gouging of his eyes i don t think would lessen that i think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him although it did cause him a lot of pain i believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes may i clarify something really quick here so you re saying basically because she asked where in hell would he be so f irst of all what level do you think he d be gouging eyes or not where would he be in hell where would dante run into him he would be with the murderers with the murderers okay so you re saying that he wouldn t be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging no that is just his own retribution yeah he did that to lessen the guilt in his life in himself cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes and also even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with like suicides right cause there s the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell or they destroy their possessions i didn t quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had i don t know maybe a couch or something if you destroyed that you d go to hell because they destroyed their own items right right in circle nine and that s what important about this in circle nine those people that destroyed or take from you know you have canna after cain everything is allegorical every part of circle nine there s an allegory there s ptolemy there s cain everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins because of what they did to humanity like ptolemy murdered people in his in his he was a ruler he just murdered people mass murders so he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin that hitler type of sin so everybody in that level too which would be interesting to see talk about some of our other literature talk about the odyssey a little more i have one more question about sin do you think is everyone s definition of sinning the same actually i don t believe so we were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in limbo goes along with what he said was no i didn t steal so you stole and then you lied yeah so you double dipped so you half and did different things oh interesting so what d you come to we came to they d go to the serious one yeah whichever one s more serious why basically the one thing that impacted the world more like in a bad way is going to take the worse punishment so if i stole a penny or i lied to the king i d probably get punished for lying to the king that s what we kind of came up with yeah so i want to ask you a question if you re saying you lied and then you lie about lying or you steal and you lie about lying i don t steal sorry yeah they re two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes okay so does that play into that would you suffer twice the punishment then no it doesn t bring up any of that in dante s basically everybody s got the same punishment but still wouldn t you get like harsher well depending on the circle yeah but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people will you give me an example well let s see ulysses and i forget the other guy s name they are in the same flame and i think he said the flame was burning brighter i would assume that d be a worse punishment than other people if they re burning if they re burning yeah some of the less worse um lesser punishments it s like magicians get their heads turned backwards you could see where you ve been but you wouldn t cry over it unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again yeah then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again yeah yeah i want to ask you guys a question because we ve studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying oedipus and i don t know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together but there is what is her name antigone s brother s name that was dead polynices yeah polynices was it the one where she was like leaning over his body yeah by the rock yeah okay now that you ve read the inferno do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur i can relate okay talk to me about that because it reminds me of dante being lost in the forest in the beginning and then it reminds me of how oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn t see anything and so he didn t know which path to take he had to rely on somebody else he had to rely on virgil to get him through what was to come then oedipus he had to rely on antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically nice nice that s what i got well as i walk away i want you guys cause i m going to leave this here i want you guys to talk about other literature cause you said yes i can relate some you just did i would like for you to relate all right okay okay,0.0
all the water goes into the jeans and this water dripped out the bottom mmhm so it ll drip out the bottom as it dries and go into the ground okay other ideas about a other ideas about a okay how about b it disappeared it no longer exists it s gone forever maybe not forever but it s gone anybody choose b no choosers for b okay how about c it s in the air in an invisible form kyle i think it s evaporated into a gas and you can t see it it evaporated into a gas and you can t see it okay other ideas about c i just have similar to kyle s but water vapor you can t usually see it okay so it became water vapor which you can t see alright how about d it moved up to the clouds lots of ds how about mina what do you think well i think it evaporated and then it went up so it evaporated and went up and when things evaporate they form clouds mm no okay so who can you explain your ideas well it was like actually it did go into the clouds because the water s still wet so okay so when it evaporates it goes to clouds alright other ideas about d moving to the clouds luke i do think that it turned into water vapor okay but i think that maybe clouds are there and then it gets soaked up by clouds sort of okay so okay let s talk about some of these ideas so i m hearing the word evaporate from a couple different people what does that mean to evaporate what are your ideas about that emmie doesn t it mean to like when the water gets at a certain temperature it turns into a gas okay so when water gets to a certain temperature it changes to a gas other ideas about evaporate or what that means when it changes to a gas what s happening ideas about that mitch well maybe it first comes out of the machine maybe the sun could make it heat a lot and sort of the bubble question like maybe it could be a heat bubble under each town not be an actual bubble but go up to the water cycle and then go come back down okay so when you say go up to the water cycle what happens to it it s evaporated up it s evaporated and where is it when it evaporates in the clouds in the clouds okay other ideas jake well when it evaporates the way it works is the heat makes it so the atoms get go farther apart and that makes it change into the state of gas okay the atoms go farther apart so is it still water yes but in a different form okay okay other ideas about evaporation and how about clouds so some people are saying when it evaporates it turns into a cloud what is a cloud ethan share i think it s like a gas okay but then i think when it evaporates and goes up to the cloud and then i think it will be turned into rain i agree yeah so first it s a gas when it s a cloud and then it turns back to rain uh huh okay jamie other ideas i think a cloud is like water turning into mist and it gathers in the cloud so when it gets dark it builds up with more water and then when it rains all the the cloud gets too heavy with water and then it rains okay so it s a mist yeah is it a liquid or a gas a liquid slash a liquid slash gas okay a little of both okay okay alright let s move on how about e it changed into a new substance no takers for e new substance okay how about f it went to the sun it went up to the sun no takers for f either there s a lot of hands i m not seeing up how about g it broke down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen alex i said that because well it goes up into the sky and it must be really humid because it like i can t remember is it when the atoms separate or and because we re humidity ing it yeah okay so it becomes more humid and that makes the atoms separate is that what you re saying well not exactly it s hard to find the words okay can you try it separates and that s what makes it humid well i don t know i guess i ll come back to you keep thinking about it how could you explain your ideas joey what are your ideas i can i go off of alex yeah oh so when hot air rises so when the water gets to a certain temperature i forgot who said that but it the atoms spread apart and change into a gas and it would be more humid because hot air rises and the gas rises into the clouds okay so as the hot air rises the gas rises with it is that what you re saying mmhm okay and the water becomes hydrogen and oxygen as it goes up mmhm okay other ideas dylan well so there s oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere and the atmosphere is gas and gas doesn t sit at the bottom it s in the air which means it s obviously floating i guess and so if water turns into vapor which i think most of us know and vapor can float and obviously it s turning into a gas like oxygen and hydrogen and so how would water be able to float if it s turning into gases it s breaking down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen it s still almost like a liquid gas but if it wasn t a gas that consists of things like hydrogen and oxygen how would it be able to float how would it be able to turn to clouds okay so it can t be water still if it s going to be floating around in the air well yeah is that what you re saying it s still water but it s in a different form that it has components that make up it s pretty much a liquid gas almost it s a liquid gas yes yeah which makes it float in the air well yeah gas gas can float and hydrogen and oxygen okay so it becomes hydrogen and oxygen in the air well as it heats up then it breaks because as it heats up then it creates vapor water evaporates and so as it heats up when it gets to that point then it breaks down into atoms and everything else okay when it gets to the air yeah when it turns into vapor okay when it turns into vapor that s when it becomes hydrogen because yeah that s how it when the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen break down i m guessing that that means that that s when it s turning into vapor okay okay okay great luke other ideas i think it might become the combination of the two because i think more than just one because i think it does split into different atoms which makes it a gas and then um and then also it could go into the clouds or something like in other parts of the answer okay so maybe it turns into this hydrogen and oxygen gas but then goes to the clouds yeah because i think that that s kind of the only way to go to the clouds and i think its probable that it would so okay okay okay lots of different ideas we re going to move on so that we can get to the others how could we observe this what could we do to know if some of these options are the right option or be able to eliminate them as possible options what could we do turn and talk to your partner quickly what could we observe and see what happens okay would we be able to eliminate any of these if we agreed with owen s suggestion eliminate f how come because the sun s very far away okay and it s really really hot so okay if we did it in the classroom would it be able to get to the sun no it d be stuck in the classroom right okay are there others that we might be able to eliminate if we did that good okay let s hear your ideas what could we do how could we observe this scenario trenton i haven t heard from you today okay so to eliminate some of them if soaked into the ground you could check if the ground was wet or anything and it moved up to the clouds you could check if there s any clouds okay see if a cloud forms okay miley other ideas i agree with trenton but i think i ve seen them where the area s curved over like our roof and the sun is out you can see mist kind of stuff coming out and i think if we did that then maybe we could observe something that could be useful okay what would we have to do though to set this up what do we need owen you can wet a paper towel and then hang it from somewhere and then heat it by a light and then or you could have a fan okay heat it with a light or a fan so perfect i like your idea so we have a cloth it s wet is it wet kind of kind of it s not wet enough should we make it a little more wet yeah okay let me make it a little more wet that better yeah okay and in this scenario this is hanging outside right well we re going to hang it in our classroom and since we don t have a lot of sun today we re going to make our own light energy with this lamp so don t look at the lightbulb because it s real bright there we go and we re going to set it up here so as we watch this which one of these or which ones might we be able to eliminate so as we observe what can we how will we know which ones are true or not true let me give you a minute to think i want to hear from someone new i haven t heard from yet who haven t i heard from yet augustine a because i wasn t sure if the ground was wet or dry perfect yeah it can t soak into the ground right so we ll see if the counter is wet if there s a puddle there then we ll know that a is the correct answer excellent others that we might be able to eliminate just by observing jake b it disappears and no longer exists because nothing can t disappear something can t disappear unless it goes into a black hole okay will we be able to observe that though no not really yeah so that one might be tricky but that s good prior knowledge jamie others that we might be able to eliminate we can tell if it moved up to the clouds because there s no way it can move up to the clouds because there s a ceiling yeah there s a ceiling well so if we saw a cloud forming in our classroom right then we d know that it makes a cloud but if we don t see a cloud then we ll know that we can eliminate that one that one s wrong good others that we can eliminate miley f it went up to the sun because it can t we don t have a sun in the classroom if we saw it right gathering up the light right that might tell us that maybe f is true but it can t get to the sun because it s stuck in our classroom good any others that we might be able to eliminate emmie we might be able to well c because if the cloud isn t wet anymore and you can t see anything or feel anything we would know that that s true okay okay so if it disappears we can t see it or feel it in the cloth but we can t see it anywhere else maybe we ll know that c is more likely okay good very good excellent so we re going to keep observing for these things those are the things that we want to keep an eye out look for a cloud forming look for water puddling at the bottom look for water gathering at the light see if it chemically changed into a new substance we might be able to see it right in our classroom somewhere so we ll be observing for that is it going to happen immediately no no so we ll have to come back to this one keep looking back as we go in the meantime uh oh no here we go we ll go to the next one next scenario what s in the bubbles so turn to that scenario in your notebook if you re not there right now what s in the bubbles so hannah is boiling water in a glass teakettle she notices bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle that rise to the top and wonders what is in the bubbles she asks her family what they think this is what they say so who agrees with dad who may agree with dad owen well since it s being heated and being heated from the bottom the bubbles will form on the bottom as heat and then the heat would make it rise to the top okay the heat makes it rise to the top good other ideas other people who agree with dad mitch well i agree with dad and calvin okay and for dad if the bubbles are heat maybe the heat forms the bubbles and then the oxygen in the bubbles makes it float to the top okay okay so let s move on to calvin then other thoughts about calvin who agrees the bubbles are filled with air reed i forgot okay we ll come back to you anybody else agree with calvin anyone i haven t heard from yet today no trenton anything for you to contribute well i didn t at first and i don t really know if i do still but like i kind of do because with the water all water has oxygen in it which is kind of like air and then the air could be in the bubbles because the bubbles would probably heat up and be at the bottom and then the air would fill up from the water and go into the bubbles and then okay so there s air in the water and as it heats up it comes out of the water okay other ideas miley i agree with trenton and mitch because they could be both filled with air but they could be hot because it s where the source of heat is okay alright reed did you remember yes okay go ahead well the heat can take the air out of the water the heat would take the air out of the water like trenton was saying and since air s lighter than water it would rise to the top it goes to the top okay good how about grandma the bubbles are an invisible form of water anyone agree with grandma rupo i said i believe with grandma because i thought that they d go up to the top i thought it was just invisible because i thought it was just going up and the cloud s just evaporating higher and higher okay so there are the bubbles are evaporated water and then go away okay matthew well it had to be a form of water because it came from water i guess and they re invisible so yeah okay so it had to be water because it s coming from water and you can t see it so it s invisible uh huh great how about mom the bubbles are empty there s nothing inside them who agrees with mom who agrees with mom jonathan i think that there s nothing inside the bubbles because how could anything get in the bubbles in the first place how could that turn into bubbles okay how could anything be in there where would it have come from yeah okay anybody else agree with mom anybody else agree with mom okay how about lucy the bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen that separated from the water lots of hands who haven t i heard from today jodie well i don t really know why because it just sounded more scientific sounds more scientific okay any other reasons no no alright kyle can you add on to that i think in the water when it s not hot that there s oxygen and hydrogen and other things in it and then when it heats up it forms into i don t know it rises up okay so where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from i think it s part of the water it s part of the water okay good emmie well i know that i m pretty sure water is made of two oxygen molecules and one hydrogen molecule opposite oh other way around yup two hydrogens and one oxygen you re right okay and i m with lucy because bubbles usually kind of probably form by the water and inside and since the water s the molecules that that s what s happening okay so water,0.0
the fact that he couldn t do it because he didn t have enough money to do it what would you do in that situation would you try to get money isn t this kind of different because we re all girls yeah but if it was a boy and he was the one who didn t have money do you feel like the chapters that we read do you feel like you could tell what pip was going to be doing kind of you could tell that he was becoming more stuck up wants to change himself and not be around the poor people are you doing the discussion director did you do any questions in regards to his did you have any direct questions with regards to the text yeah one of them was like how did pip change from the beginning of the book to where he s at now like his character and basically how he acted what was the question i missed brianna where you said about the girls i didn t hear the question i just heard your response his was in chapter 29 when he is becoming part of her marriage he was just like how would you feel or whatever none of us really had an answer because the situation is different like it s different for the guys she s the one who s like the rich girl who s the recording one so on page 128 paragraph two that s where herbert tells miss havisham s story that s important because it kind of explains why she is the way that she is he explains that you meet miss pocket and then she s kind of like he kind of explains why she s kind of crazy all right chapter 8 was interesting because he was home from war and in the camp he started to treat people he treated them like they were all heroes and he shared the cigarettes with him one time he shared the cigarettes with them and was even when he was amongst the russians he didn t care they were struggling to survive he felt sorry for them which as a connector i ve connected it to i don t know if you guys have seen tears of the sun i have and avatar in tears of the sun he wanted to go and try to rescue people but he got stuck behind enemy lines like they re struggling people too trying to gain their freedom and then same thing in avatar paul kind of reminded me of how he was behind and he was with the russians but he thought that they weren t as bad as he the military was the only bad part about them civilians he felt sorry for them that they had to go through all this they were being killed their people were being killed and they were actually just regular people trying to make it everybody was dying because they used all this stuff in the military and they weren t caring about the civilians the prisoners they were they had to trade whatever they had to get like a couple supplies to the refugees he started to wonder like why are people higher up people he d never met forcing them yeah so then this whole section made me think about that so i thought that could be like the controversial part to talk about this whole section which whole section the one you were just talking about they re talking about magic yeah they re talking about the magic and being invisible and then he and scares them away it really showed a struggle between antonio internally with religions yeah in one he had keys and then in the other one it was totally crazy yeah that s my next section is that dream i think it s page 119 that whole dream is really important because it s like it kind of highlights what i just said about how he might be the next person or whatever he goes to this dream and it s kind of the same thing he s been facing through the whole book his mom s side versus his dad s side and ultima kind of comes out and is like well you are both you have to find a happy medium it s all within the world of his dreams and then page 139 one part that i thought was really really important was his brother at the brothel these two chapters i think they re kind of jam packed i just kind of picked stuff that would be good to talk about and then page 139 paragraph three they re talking about how the group can be buried in the casket of time i just felt that was informative and something that we should look at just pretty much the whole funeral the funeral was good styling like i don t know these four chapters there was no part where you didn t it s like read these four chapters exactly after i read the chapter i wrote some questions down the first one is what did the contrast between the golden carp and the black bass how the golden carp made the black bass jump and his missing of the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for abel the golden carp story was just very interesting the whole controversy is that he s catholic but part of him really wants to believe in this whole it s not like he wasn t interested in it but he still didn t believe but then he still respected the story itself and the respect of the carp it made me feel like the golden carp would bring it up could antonio it made me feel that antonio s struggle between his mother s beliefs and his father s how his father was like on the corpse strewn shore i remember there was something like when you re in the ocean it s the same water it s like ultima came in she was like you don t pick one you re both that s it you can t just choose one path you should be a priest cowboy i think the way it was portrayed was like because of the way he was brought up it was kind of showing the negative she s brought up she s not there but she s brought up too much i feel like she s a goal though to be like be some kind of spirit type thing he hopes that she s like someone who s not fake so i guess he s trying to like make things work with everyone else and see like what his relationship with other people and to finally be able to call a i feel like he compares all of his relationships to her he has that standard didn t he point out like all the flaws of her that was just creepy i was just like poor guy to have all of these weird awkward dreams i m going to say foreshadowing i m sticking by that and saying ultima s going to die and he s going to be the new i m sticking by that and that s foreshadowing look at you go all of those things are foreshadowing or are they just predicting something that happened in the past most of them well i think the one where remember where he went into a brothel in the one dream right exactly so i think that most of the dreams are foreshadowing they re not showing directly what happens but hints basically i m a beast we don t even have to read the rest of the book because i just gave it to you because we know what s happening i said also in chapter 14 the bad dream what do you make of it is he seeing the sinners as deserters that all witches are being spun out and that he needs to step forward or does the golden carp have like stronger power what do you think it symbolizes i think there are good witches and there are bad witches the bad witches are the ones that should be like that s antonio s issue as well i think he s kind of figured out that there s something different about ultima i think he s kind of figured out that he s kind of just like oh they re evil and she s good if she s a witch then she s evil so it s kind of this contrast of can a witch be good it s kind of like the question of what he wants to believe versus it kind of relates to the civil war and the africans and their personal stuff it kind of relates to that the white people they didn t want to believe that they re intelligent and they re friends he doesn t want to believe that a witch can be good because he s been told otherwise and he s a catholic and witches are evil i think that the golden carp symbolizes perhaps the rebirth i think the two most important themes symbol figures are the owl and the carp,0.0
three four five six we have six friends at the table and let s see i have one uh leave it there please eulet christmas two christmas uh it s a little bit like christmas you re right three oh i have

looked like you almost fell alright alex yours is on look we have orange and blue so now what do you do my turn oh is that right surafel s turn oh you guys are great seven i have seven beads you have seven beads i ll count how many beads i have one two three four five very good six seven oh good you have seven too you have the same number okay now what are we gonna do it was my turn okay who s turn is it alex okay good take this give it to alex and tell him it s give him this part and say alex it s your turn now his turn oh very nice now we can count one two one two three four five six uh oh the watch has to uh oh yours is brianna you put on a blue one okay now what happens brianna three four five okay hold on brianna six seven eight okay take it no wait a minute you had a turn can you give it now to natalie give it to natalie six i ve got six look give this to natalie and tell her it s your turn now natalie wow we are doing some nice work did you give it back to surafel for his turn alex yay alright there s an orange one surafel what are you going to do now this is of it all what do you do now alex pretty yay tell him alex your turn uh oh did we have a bead get away uh oh uh oh this bead doesn t want to go on the string it s five i have five i like the way you re taking turns okay you are almost finished eulet you re working so nicely with friends and the red has okay one two three four five six uh oh seven eight nine ten that s okay how did that happen we ve got two blue ones on there whoops that s okay now surafel is having his turn look what i m making oh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten are you finished yes okay show me what are you going to do now four five six oh you did some counting good i did okay and you have finished your turn so what do you do now you only have two left one two is it your turn nah okay so what do you say you say alex alex your turn okay friends we re almost done let me see uh oh we need a red one you know what i m going to make it so that you have the same number as your friend okay your turn let s see my turn here we go and you have the same number okay eulet can you talk to your partner your turn what are you going to say oh okay she said it s your turn can you say thank you thank you okay and we are almost finished uh oh we re doing some different turn taking here but that s okay alright okay so now who s turn is it alex okay give it to alex say alex your turn your turn three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen okay we re not counting so much right now we re taking turns who s turn is it now my turn natalie s turn okay so you tell her it s lily s turn i m next that s right tell her this is lily lily s turn look what happened did you finish yeah did you string all your beads yeah you did all of your beads are on your string let s look oh and you too nice job look you did orange and blue orange and blue orange and lots of blue orange and blue orange and blue beautiful okay i m gonna lay it right here let s look at yours because you finished and you used all of your beads oh look you used different colors you did blue can you say it with me red blue red blue red azul rojo azul rojo can you say that brianna azul rojo azul rojo azul you guys did a great job of taking turns we finished we finished you finished look you used all of your beads your trays are empty let s hold it up and look at the colors and the pattern you made can you tell me the pattern purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow yay and we know that you took turns because the colors changed every time it s clean up time you guys did a great job and you re right it is we are finished we learned how to take turns with a partner and we put beads on a string and made a color pattern because we took turns yes it was all good and i think you all get to ring the good job bell good job taking turns eulet good job taking,0.0
how do you know because my dad works oh okay see i want us to think about that because that was something that came up yesterday sometimes we think oh that s only stuff men do or that s only stuff women do but especially mechanics working on engines and stuff like that we think that s a man s job but you said your dad works with a lot of women and kyle your dad s a kind of a mechanic too and he works with a lot of women too so girls think about that kind of thing okay thank you very good all right now carter come up please carter all right carter tell us about the job works on people when they are injured firefighters work on burning equipment and carrying test hydrants and inspect businesses okay so your job is say it real loud so they can hear you a firefighter and a paramedic okay and what are the skills that that job uses math reading writing computer technology there it is be proactive begin with the end in mind first thing s first think win win synergize great okay so all of the seven habits right okay interesting who s next and are there women firefighters yes and paramedics absolutely good job carter okay taylor taylor green all right taylor tell us the job a machinist and tell us a little bit about what they do repair and turbine engines for helicopters and tanks helicopters and tanks and they use what math technology be proactive okay very good do you think women can do that kind of job yes absolutely okay so we said math technology are big ones there working on the helicopters tanks things like that okay next let s have lexi lexi wilson all right lexi all right tell us about your job furniture showroom manager i assist customers with furniture purchases inventory the furniture we have on hand update customers orders all right and we use what skills math science oh i wasn t watching you that s okay not so much science reading writing computer technology be proactive put first things first think win win and synergize okay now i m gonna ask you a hard question science the person with that job indicated they use science in a furniture showroom management position how do you think they use science maybe they make the furniture the materials maybe they use and stuff like that good good job all right thank you okay so we can see that all of the skills that we re learning in school right now especially technology skills computer skills reading math even science our parents are using those jobs uh skills in their jobs right now in real life so someday you re gonna be using exactly what you re doing right now in a job as well as our personal skills our seven habit skills being in charge of ourselves thinking about things ahead of time planning ahead putting first things first good job all right now we re gonna take our group cards and on the cards you have a job listed one of the jobs that you re looking at in your group and a skill that goes along with that job what i want you to do is as a group discuss how can we show the use of that skill in our job that we have okay so look at your cards figure out how you re gonna use the skill listed on the skill card and then we re gonna role model to the rest of the class the use of our skill and show how we use that skill in the job that s on that card okay so start discussing and then in a few minutes i m gonna call you back and we re gonna start showing the rest of the class our skills we re the paralegal we could do well for reading skills we could do filing or we could prepare bills for clients but to prepare bills for clients we d have to read you know who they are and then for filing we d have to read whose bill it was class when your children get ready for heading where they go down to gym for the program this morning we are right now in the process of calling kindergarten we re gonna get them to head down the hallway to the gym first and then we re going to have second grade come on down third grade fourth grade and fifth grade okay so payton is gonna lay on the floor and then i m gonna get to do a knee surgery on him first i ll like get a pencil pretend i m cutting the knee open and pulling it and then cutting the muscle and replacing the broken parts of the knee bone with like using our skills we can measure the wire right here and we could measure how long it could be for the house electricity circuits and we can measure how long the wire is and somebody could be in the house and we could measure how long the wire is so let s do the thing we did yesterday when you re laying on the floor and i m trying to put the breath back in you and then i ask carly what happened okay so you two are doing it do you think maybe a table and chairs and maybe a couch yeah a sofa and then you ll get over behind the table and everything and then i can say what day and what time and that s writing down what writing skills writing skills very good very good we re gonna show like you you would be like typing on the computer and you would be and i would come up and ask what you re doing and so the other people would know what you re doing on the computer i would come up and ask what you re doing and you would say i m making a blueprint like cause if we did use set up machines for production and we use synergize we d have to work together to do it and how do we do that miss kimberly yes ma am how do we act out setting up for productions setting up machines well since you re act you want to show synergizing now what does synergizing mean working together okay so you need to involve working together yeah okay and certainly with being a mechanic you re working on what machines machines and so what you wanna try to demonstrate is everybody working together to build a machine possibly that would be a good one i think all right we re going to go ahead and start our demonstrations so i m gonna ask morgan landon and abby s group to show us their skill and tell us what your job is tell us what s your job a paralegal a paralegal and your skill is reading okay let s see how they re using reading second grade and third grade please come on down to the gym thank you okay great that s good now what were they doing filing reading filing exactly very good good job okay let s have luke destiny payton and where do you guys wanna go up here all right tell us your job certified surgical tech wonderful and your skill put first things first first things first okay clear okay great so what were some luke what was the first thing you did the first thing first i had to gently cut his knee open and pull it apart and then cut his muscle and pull it open and then get a mini saw and cut the pieces of the knee bone and replace it okay and then what would be the last thing that a surgeon does stitch the knee back together okay all right good job clear good job first thing s first okay all right now we wanna see reagan mackenzie and logan let s see y all and where do you wanna go in the middle okay that s fine and tell us your job electrician that uses math skills okay electrician come in it s over here he s measuring how long the wire is 3 feet okay okay now what were they doing measuring the wire electrician and you were say it again say what you were we were measuring the wires measuring measuring okay so and measuring is part of math math very good all right good job good job okay all right let s have let s see it ll be josh alyssa and taylor g our job is maintenance mechanic,0.0
the corners the corners that s fine how do you get exactly one painted face which one of these have just one color on them the middle yeah just the ones in the middle on each face and how many of them are there six so that s 6 out of 27 so that s fine and realize that if you did it right those are all your options each of these cubes has either zero colors up to three colors nothing has four colors so that means all your probabilities should add up to what 27 27 out of 27 does it no no so what s the issue one of these numbers at least has to be off so figure out which one that is see if you could figure what one so keep in mind these look right but realize these are all probabilities because you re picking them out of that hat so these should all be out of 27 right because there s 27 cubes you re picking from right and if you did it right and these are all the cubes then they should add up to what 27 right does it yeah it does 27 okay so fine good so when you do the next one it should all be out of we can figure that out you can figure that out isn t it 16 times 4 so 64 so where are you getting these numbers from my mind okay so i get no painted faces there s just the one cube that s right in the middle so that s one out of because you re picking them out 1 out of 27 you gotta do a probability right but then how many have one painted face how d you get six which six the middle ones sure the middle ones and there s six faces so it makes sense 6 out of 27 how do you get three painted faces i didn t do that one okay the corners so that should be eight and then realize if you did this right it should all at up to what 27 27 out of 27 so how do you figure out how many have two painted faces just add these together and subtract them yeah you could do that now there is a pattern to the two just like the other ones but you can also subtract and figure that out so yeah good oh that brings up a good point everybody for your first cube for your very first cube everything should be out of what number 27 27 all your probabilities should be out of 27 is it possible you can reduce the fractions when you figure it out yes yes i m gonna tell you don t reduce them leave it out of 27 even if it s 3 out of 27 don t reduce it to one ninth just leave it at 3 out of 27 it ll help you down the line so those look good and you know one of the ways you could check if you did this right is all four of these should add up to what 27 27 and does it yeah it adds up to 27 out of 27 so you got all your bases covered so that s good okay good keep going how many have no painted faces four why four which four the four is right over here inside and then there s four okay but let me ask you this there s these four but you said go inside a layer and then you re right there s four underneath but then there s another layer underneath that so there s eight so there should be eight and one of the ways you know you re right about this besides just hoping that you re thinking about it the right way how do you know there s three painted faces which eight are you talking about the corners the corners so you know you re right with the eight but these should all add up to what and they do so you re okay okay good so keep going and you re good it s all out of 64 so that s a good start will this still have one painted face well there is a pattern to it just like the other ones but it s fine if you can t figure that out yet just keep going you ve got the right number so see if you can figure it out now for the 4x4x4 how are we doing on the front side everything good so let me ask you this about this stuff i assume you all have the same answers yeah so you said one painted face there s six of them which six just one color painted sure the center of each of the six faces and there s six faces so six times one is six that s fine no we got 8 out of 27 for three because which ones are you looking at the corners no painted faces there s just one in the middle if you added all these up what should they equal but what does it equal up to not 27 so what s the issue what s the deal there no idea where is there something going wrong because you know that one has to be eight you know there s exactly one because it s the center one in each of the six sides so you know that has to be six the issue is with the two painted faces it s not eight now you can figure it out by subtracting and just figuring out what adds up to 27 or you could go back and just look at those how many of those have the two painted faces where are you getting eight from which cubes here have two painted faces these ones so that s four on this front side there s four on the back side that s eight two on this side 10 12 12 does that make sense and that adds up to 27 then when you add all those up so now do the same thing for the one out of 64 okay good how we doing these should add up to 64 shouldn t they they should add up to 64 how do you get no painted faces how do you get the four with no painted faces the center pieces so over here let s say these four in the middle but you re not looking at those those have one painted face but you look a layer below that and that s four right there but you can go a layer below that so that should be eight so does that mess up something else i don t know how you got the other numbers so the equation for this it d be distance divided by two to get three does that work up here you re on the right track you re thinking the right way minus two does that work i mean once you get this i would try to do a 5x5x5 cube even though i didn t write it down there see if it holds up yeah because there d be 27 in the middle that seems to make sense and that ll help you on the back side when you get there so these look fine let s talk about this one for a second if you add these up you have 24 24 18 4 if you add all those up what do you get do you 60 60 right now you have 60 out of 64 so there s four squares you haven t counted yet where did they go and you kinda know you re right with the three colored cubes because you know which ones they are which ones are those so would we add it to the non painted faces why you can t randomly what s the pattern which ones have no painted faces the ones on the top so basically you have these four right here but a layer below right but there s also another layer below that oh so it s eight so that s where there s eight does that make sense oh yeah i see that so that s where that s coming from so now it adds up to 64 it looks like you re probably good why don t you try doing it for a 5x5x5 cube before you go to the back side so at least you have some patterns you can detect it ll make the back side easier but it should be a breeze now to get the 5x5x5 cube wow chris you re on a roll smart idea making a graph and that should be eight over what over here how many squares do we have we have 27 and you got that because it s three cubed three cubed and the other one is four cubed if you do the 5x5x5 it would be five cubed so if you have an nxnxn what is that n cubed so everything should be out of n cubed on the back and you re right that it s eight out of n cube for the three painted why don t you try the no painted that s probably the next one to get but what there s the one middle how do you figure that out and this is where you gotta go back and look at the pattern you got for no painted faces how did you figure that out and maybe the numbers help but maybe just look at the picture and figure out how did we know how many had no painted faces right what do those numbers have in common okay how we doing well you re definitely right with eight over n cubed that makes sense right because always the corners in the cube it s always the same how did you get 6n here and you got it over here you guys have 6n in different places well see i thought i got a brain blast what but it didn t work out i mean i felt really smart for two seconds but i was thinking that since there s six sides it has to be six times something okay okay that s not a bad way to think you know the answer here was 12 yeah that was with the 3x3x3 cube does that work if n is three you would get 18 but that s not what you got on the front side so there s some discrepancy okay but that s not a bad way to think some of these things have to do with six faces like there s some multiplying by six involved you know the corner ones are gonna be eight no matter what that has nothing to do with six faces right right that s just the corners how do you do this go back a second sorry a lot of flipping you feel confident about these two sets of numbers yeah so why don t you try doing it 5x5x5 cube even though i didn t ask for it but see what numbers you get for that because it ll make the back page a little better because now you ll have more numbers to use and try to find a pattern you guys have different numbers why is that what do you mean on the front side what do you mean sarah has 8 out of 64 here you have 4 out of 64 here oh blood oh my god do you need to go go go go to the bathroom i don t care i care go do you have band aids now i don t know i don t think i do go to the bathroom things still happen so you have eight out of eight cubed that s fine we know the three painted faces are going to be which ones the corners the corners and there s always gonna be eight so that s fine eight out of n cubed how do you figure out how many have zero painted faces it s always the ones in the middle yes always the ones in the middle so when you had a 3x3x3 cube what was in the middle one and what s the dimensions of that cube 1x1x1 when it was a 4x4x4 cube what were the dimensions of the middle that you couldn t see 4x4x4 well 4x4x4 is the whole cube 2x2x2 2x2x2 if it was a 5x5x5 cube what would be the middle 3x3x3 3x3x3 if its an nxnxn cube what s the middle you kinda have it if it s 6x6x6 what s the middle i don t know i m kinda lost okay go back for a second you lost me at the 5x5x5 one okay you know its 3x3x3 and the center was 1x1x1 that s the ones you couldn t see any color 4x4x4 cube what s the center 2x2x2 if it s a 5x5x5 cube let s say what would the center be 3x3x3 3x3x3 if it s a 6x6x6 cube 4x4x4 if it s an nxnxn cube n minus two times n minus two times n minus two so what s the pattern for no painted faces n minus two cubed exactly that s the sort of pattern you need to find for those first two now how are you figuring these out when you actually have a concrete 5x5x5 cube is this what you re supposed to do because it s saying that n is the number of small cubes so you can t just say it s a 4x4x4 n is representing the whole 125 cubes right right so is this the correct equation for one painted sides for one painted side yeah for one painted side well how are you finding the one painted face or how many painted cubes did you have here i had six six which six it s basically the one in the center but there s six faces so we multiplied by six so i get where this is coming from the multiply by six so n represents the 125 n represents how many across you have oh i thought n represented the whole no i mean,0.0
5 03 5 03 all right let s talk for a minute before you continue with your little test first of all let s talk about motion what do you know about motion motion is the way that you get from one place to another it s changing position changing position so just now bailey was running was he changing position yes yes all right so how do we know that he was in motion like when he is running toward me how do i know he s in motion that stays there and you can see him coming up nobody else was moving around so that s our frame of reference he came over there so we know he s coming toward us all right so you guys did a trial how many times did you run bailey three all right so what are we gonna do now we re gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three why are we dividing by three because we did it three times okay you did it three times you re finding your average what s another word for average mean mean good all right so let s find his mean or his average and then we ll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number okay what did you get 5 21 5 21 is that what everybody has nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that let s name some things that are in motion what do you know that s in motion the earth the earth is in motion yup but i don t feel the earth move so how do i know it s in motion cause sun is the frame of reference okay so if i was thinking of the sun which is what they do and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference what else do you know that moves animals animals insects cars insects cars boats people people books boats boats all right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what s something else that i need to know besides how long it took him the distance the distance traveled which is a hundred feet so what difference did we do hundred feet a hundred feet okay so what s the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet yes you did that and chalk marked it good all right so let s we re talking about the average time taken all right so let s do that now 19 so let s talk about what that means 19 19 feet per second what s that mean feet per second 19 feet per second so if i say feet per second can you explain that to me what does that mean 19 feet per second every second i would go 19 19 feet good okay so if i m driving in my car and my car s going 70 miles per hour and i m on the interstate do i say my car s going 75 no no you d say miles per hour bleh 70 miles per hour can you tell me nathan why what does that mean 70 miles per hour 70 miles per hour means you re going 70 miles per each hour for every hour so that s good to know for vacations right especially when you have little kids who are saying are we there yet you gotta figure out how long it s gonna take you are we there yet right okay all right you re going to go into your next part and i ll be right back to check on you who s the next person jordan it s gonna be jordan all right miss jordan hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up he thinks he needs one more piece of tape ready ready set go 1 76 1 89 okay so why don t you write them both do you have two spots only have one you have two spots write one there and one there that s what you do there just like that what did you get 1 89 1 89 all right let s come talk about what you re doing so let s get the three kinds of balloons that you re testing just gonna bring over here dan why don t you get the um come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one we might try that one here so we have a big round one a big round one a green one okay a long one okay and a birthday one did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions different different predictions what do you think the happy birthday one you think the happy birthday one long long long long can you tell me why you think happy birthday and then you ll tell me why you think long at first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it but now there s wind blowing it blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster it d be like this wind yes you had this big that is a pretty good prediction why do you guys think it s gonna be the long one i think it s the long one because it s more smaller and the air can come off faster and it s more stretchier stretchier tight it s more tight all right all right we had some wasn t going all the way so we changed it to 20 it would stop about maybe three feet away from the end it would stop so what did you decide to do we changed it to 20 you moved it to 20 okay so what else could you have done besides move it to 20 blow up the balloon more maybe blow up the balloon more maybe the little one wouldn t have worked though huh it s not that much in there we tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped the little one i think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far all right so all right so let s come back this way watch out behind you megan dan you can go over to there s motion in the wind huh 176 and 108 all right so here we go what are you gonna do first let s do the round balloon first that was nobody s prediction right nope so let s do that one first what are we gonna do 20 add both up and then what are you gonna do divide by two why are we dividing by two to get the average to get the average why did you do it twice why didn t you just and there s two the two trials why you did two trials why wouldn t you just do one why do you think that would ve been better to do two divided by then we wouldn t have to divide it we wouldn t have to find the average at all but i guess we d get a better result what d you get there 2 35 3 73 that s what i got 2 35 you add these two together and you divide them remember this is the average can you have four i divided by two but i got 3 73 let s try again on the calculator i always do things twice to double check 2 35 2 35 everybody s good okay so let s go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed so what s our formula for that how do we figure out average speed you do 20 because of the okay so that s when we took 20 because you see we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30 so let s cross out you changed it to 20 and i think it was dan that said if we were to probably no hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon but changing the feet that ll work now how fast did the first balloon go 19 35 by 20 look at your formula again 8 52 your distance is 20 so you re gonna do your distance divided by your average time good 8 51 okay and i ll come back to check on you you all right let s see how these guys are doing this one s a runner the line s over here right jordan 16 16 we re at the end of nathan s so let s go ahead and figure out nathan together i ll come sit in your spot they re in here so to figure out nathan let s talk about it together while we re doing it we need some more calculators over here wait what s this 641 everybody please do catch up got your pencils wait wait 641 575 tell me again what we re doing average time 6 08 does everybody have six read it back correctly six point o eight is that how you read it correctly in math six decimal do we say decimal six six point zero eight do we say point six and and eight hundredths six and eight hundredths ohhhh gotta get it so let s look just at our average time for just a second stop for a minute and let s look at the top at our average time how do we know who is going the fastest when we re look at just the top part just the time average time the lowest the lowest number right cause he s getting in the fastest time so now when we go to the bottom and we re figuring out the speed how do we do speed whoever s the lowest number the highest number the highest number it s going to be let s go ahead and do nathan and then we ll compare then we ll let demi do hers 16 point 16 point 16 44 right yep so let s look so far at the bottom bailey jordan and nathan who is the fastest so far bailey so far bailey okay so how can we instead of looking at this this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me what can i do visually just to make it a little bit clearer make a bar graph okay we can make a bar graph with this anything else we can do line graph maybe get each person to make a line graph take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times because that would be you right over time that would be a great idea so we can do the straight line graphs that s a good idea with the line graph bailey so when we make a line graph we ll do that at the end using this information and then we ll do a bar graph using this information does that sound good all right demi s turn s up let s go let s see how we are doing here okay we re at the very end so which one ended up being the fastest the long one the long one but i think that devon had a very good prediction i think his reasoning was good see that wind blowing in a race when you re in a race and you re running or when you re in a foot ball team what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you re trying to get that ball to the other side you want the wind to be with you right because if you re against the wind the wind is pushing on you so i think devon had an excellent good job devon next time all right we re at the bottom why do you think that balloon was the fastest i put the shape of it the wind went right past it all right remember there was unbalanced force so the force inside the balloon where was the force the wind the air the air that devon blew inside that balloon the air inside pushed the balloon and that s what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go it probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it s on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes that s a pretty good idea too it s kind of like when you re driving a car if you re on vacation sometimes your parents you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler why do you think they would do that because the wind blocks the because the wind is blocking 18 wheel blocks it the 18 wheeler s blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour i mean you can get better gas mileage doing that if you ever see your parents doing that some people don t like to do that though because of rocks rocks yeah it could be dangerous yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks good job,0.0
we haven t talked about some things that we do when we are what sad sad not sad he s ma mad mad he is really really mad he s got that mad face going rrrr he is so ugly he is so ugly he is mad and it says sometimes i get mad is it okay if we re mad yeah yeah what is no if somebody eat people i bet that way too that must have been ow ow ow if someone s biting they probably would get in trouble

do we need to be good so jakiah does that go on our red choice plate or is that a green choice that goes in our book it s the red choice it is a red choice plate you are right all of our red choices go on our plate you were right that was a red choice put is right on top nice thank you high five good job scoot back sit down alright nicholas are you ready flip that thing i caught it what are they doing on there they are smelling that flower and blowing out the candle can you show me how to do that smell your flowers now put the hand on top do it one more time for me sometimes we need to stop and take a deep breath to calm ourselves down nick is that a red choice or a green choice green choice it absolutely is a green choice here s your sticky stuff i m gonna put it right there can you stick that picture right on top please our sticky tack sticky tack put it on top please sticky tack sticky tack good job sticky tack nice thinking okay high five okay high five nice work have a seat alright kendrel lowel are you ready yeah what about this one woah woah somebody push somebody off the chair somebody pushed someone else off that chair somebody broke that head off right there it doesn t look like he has a neck does it you re right woah that s just weird try and see me criss cross applesauce jakiah show me criss cross please thank you alright kendrel is that a green choice or a red choice red choice absolutely why is that a red choice because that is very bad don t know when to snack or probably our friends at the playground why is that a red choice because they gonna get left because it hurts their friends friends it hurts their friends that pushed somebody off the chair yep alright jakiah jakiah kendrel where does that one go on the red on the red choice plate you re absolutely right alright miss jakiah flip that pancake boom what is he doing numbers numbers they are one two three and what are they doing they re counting can you help me count to ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten if we get really mad at our friends can we stop what we re doing take a deep breath and count to ten to help calm ourselves down yes would that be a green choice or a red choice green choice absolutely it is a green choice jakiah is that a green choice or a red choice red choice a red choice is it a red choice to count no does that hurt our friends if we stop and count no teacher so that s a green choice something we can add to our book though it s the red choice that s a green choice we can stop and count our red choices are that s a green things that may hurt ourselves choice and a green or our friends choice it is a green choice can you put it right there on our sticky tack in our book sticky tack put the picture on top please i know sticky s cake alright you ready mr nick yeah sticky okay let s do one more lets see what else you re sticky we can do we could can we do this one oh what are they doing walking walking they re taking a walk if we

idea to talk to people talk to our friends we can tell our friends to give it back to give it back or to give us back the toys or to stop stop we can talk to who jakiah who else can we talk to our teacher our teacher and what can we tell our teachers to give us back our toys we could say someone took my toy and they will not give it back or someone hit me give it back teachers alright we could stop and do what that guy what can we do good kendrel this one this guy what could we do nick smell that flower and then blow that candle away we can stop and take a deep breath smell that flower blow out that candle deep breath smell that flower we could push the hands push those hands how hard can you squeeze them jakiah can you show me nick s squeezing kendrel s squeezing alright we could ask our teachers to what they get a walk to take a walk sometimes we may just need to to get out of our classroom and that is okay you re loud that was loud you re right you screamed but you know what i like how you used your words and told him you told him that you were screaming and that hurt my ears alright using your words i did you did too alright what s our last one we can one two numbers we can stop and count count we count to ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it makes my teachers happy when i am calm and not mad,0.0
okay let s get busy so before we change the car we have two more times okay let s look jacob let s help it s 9 3 what is 9 three 93 93 is there a way that we can maybe change to other things here to make it go further like the car yeah how maybe the height how about you guys discuss oh try it put that way back like that it might need help for you holding the ramp how bout you do you think that s a good idea i m gonna roll it back alright oh is it gonna stay you think yeah i bet awesome let s see how far it went watch your foot 105 what is 105 105 i love the way that you re making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in so let s take a look jacob let s look over here let s look at our data we have the roll one with just the normal way we had 101 inches and then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches and roll three at 105 inches which way went the furthest 103 roll three roll three why do you think that is because it s 101 that one is 101 and that ones 105 well why do you think roll one is different from roll three because ones higher then the other higher then the other because ones higher then the other okay so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle i think we should what do you think we should pick take away the girl take away the girl nothing what do you guys think about hailey s idea what did she say jacob s hold on what did hailey say say it again we shouldn t even try okay okay so how about jacob since jacob was trying to make the other car how bout jacob tries to put on bigger wheels we should see what happens then here jacob well look at this look at which one would we need bigger wheels on that one that one okay so that car go farther that one will go farther probably will go farther you think with bigger wheels yeah cause the bigger the wheel the easier it has balance did you hear what he said bigger wheels have balance the bigger the wheels the more balanced it is i m saying like let s say you re is that gonna work is there anything else you guys want to do to this car or do you just want to change one thing i just change one thing okay it s your car so what about your ramp ashley what about your ramp how do you want your ramp to be maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way okay 76 you want to try that way alright that s true whoa that wasn t go far alright let s measure it goes a little bit she needs a little bit of help 72 72 we re gonna put this vehicle alright so we re not going to change the car but what could we do 32 whoa look student guys this is going to be affecting weight okay that box could stay here instead of alright you guys try it you guys got it now 91 times 2 well that s up to your group can i make my car now no not yet that s not weight three yet split weight right now so how you guys doing did you guys try to move the weight in different ways ok alright back let s do it together 56 look at that let s see what happened no it s 67 where s your data at put the data over here so we re all in the same place 83 okay let s take a look what do you have here 67 this will be so much fun okay you roll it ashley can i work on it can i have it should we take something away first no no 42 i think we should put a little one gimme that you think we should i m not sure cause the blue one wow cool oh oh my gosh here i ll yeah and without these wheels now are you ready go here here we go ouchie hold the end i ll hold it 77 no it s 67 jacob 67 might be 77 what is 77 we did it for two ways so they can do it last way that was way more yeah but how many inches was that second roll look three feet so 3 f so what three feet equals 36 inches we re going to be focused on the inches so we don t get confused so hold on wait a second when we had that ramp the first way what did you do with it the same way as the first way no we did this way just that yeah we haven t done it like that i know just re adjust this yeah so when did it go when you did just that 30 seconds no it went that what is that 73 73 so then we moved it to make it which way did we do it the second way higher we did it this way what happened to the numbers it went lower it went lower so if we go it lower it goes higher i don t know let s try so what s another ramp that we can make have you tried that way before nope alright let s see hold on a second david we have to measure nope your group can help you measure let s see 35 ooh that s seven okay let s take a look again let s make sure what s that there we go so roll three let s try now let s take a look at our data hold on that s not gonna work you don t think so well let s first take a look here and then we can see if that will work it s probably gonna fall what happened with roll three where s the data look at roll three what is it 35 and what s roll two i don t know 36 so what do you think happened whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher i mean a little bit lower i m sorry it changed it changed what happened when it changed the number i see let s focus it goes more faster it might go more faster there s not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp and you guys wanna try that yeah okay let s see let s see what happens taylor what happened it fell i knew it would my box well how about you hold that so we can try it again try it again oh no fix em and let s see if it does that every time do you think it ll do it every time yes yes let s try again i ll measure this time you ll measure yeah oh oh we have to do it again taylor you can go on the carpet this time i made it lower oh so he just said something what did he say he made it lower he made it lower so what s happening every time he makes it a little bit lower it falls off when it falls off it still can roll i mean just keep it rolling when it falls off uh oh i ll measure it okay we don t have enough space to measure that one how about we change the car and try again but what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed what happened when it was super high it fell apart it didn t work so well can you imagine if you were in a real car and you were going down something that steep yeah no that would be kinda scary wouldn t it but as it kept going down what happened it didn t go off it didn t fall apart you re right alright go back and try to make a different car okay go back and try to make it be careful your gonna make me nervous alright let s see jacob what do you have come on over nope jacob come on over what in the world did you make that looks like a mack truck girls do you see this yeah tractors throwing in something now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you big girls are you watching look at how that rolled girls you next okay this was all my idea that was your idea i love it could we try it this way we could keep a hold of that you might want to try it let s see well we should be working on correctamundo see i got a good review what do we got jacob 93 93 so what can we do to change it i guess we could maybe we re learning something we are learning something what did we learning we learned the car the littler it is the harder for it to fall that is true it s your turn is that what you re finding out the smaller the car yeah the smaller the car the more it picks up picks up cars go over oh were we going over no i it s your turn preston oh did you guys hear him let s take a second and listen he was talking about yesterday s experiment what did we do yesterday we tried rolling little cars on the carpet why didn t it work out so well jacob little cars on the carpet because the wheels stopped them why did they stop you think because the carpets too rough because the carpet s too rough did you guys find that too so what are you finding about today that the bigger the wheels the on hard surfaces it s faster on smoother and hard surfaces it goes further so what are you finding out about the ramp that you guys are finding that how about you decide that for this last one you tried one way with the ramp and now we re going to try two more ways with this ramp and i want to see if guys can figure out how this works better with a ramp,0.0
like a long a not long a long o no i ll give you a hint there s some letters up on the front what is the sound er it s er er everybody say er er okay what we re going to do if you remember last week we looked at some pictures and when you heard the er sound what sound did you make er no e r what did you make tweet tweet tweet tweet because a bird says tweet tweet and a bird has er so my first picture is a train do you hear it yes ma am no do you hear an er oh no no so are you going to say tweet tweet no no shirt tweet tweet girl tweet tweet bird tweet tweet rope no skirt tweet tweet purse tweet tweet shark tweet tweet do you hear er in shark no do you hear the difference what do you hear ar that s different okay let s look really quick eyes up here when i have the word skirt what two letters make er i r very good this is a nurse what two letters make er u r good tweet this is a fern what two letters say er e r very good we re going to read some words okay i want you to look at this word first connor look at the word everybody what word is that sir look at it think about it first what word fur four fur what s this word fur very good think about it first what word spur think about it first what word hurt think about it don t say it and what word is it spurt spurt very good think about it first what word nerve think about it what word serve think about it nurse what word nurse think about it purse what you re thinking i can t hear you think all right ready what word purse good think about it what word germ think about it don t say it yet what word term term eyes up here okay good now we re going to go to our work mats and we re going to build some words okay okay you can give the students a point because you all did a very good job everybody was paying attention and participating all right watch how miss dodd is doing this because you re going to do the same thing get your word mat out in front of you and put your letters out so you can see them we have to go kind of quick i m going to put this on top of this just for now okay thanks you re welcome all right let s see let s see how fast we can get those out let s see i m going to say we can do it in 40 seconds let me help you out let s put all these out so you can see them you have a lot of words shh okay we re not putting them down on the mat we re going to put them up here and then we re going to pull them down to the mat there we go economics shh all right let s see if we made it are we all done yes ma am all right give the students another point because you did it in enough time okay miss dodd has the words up here also the word parts so first let s look at the ending parts okay what do you think this says er er very good look at this next one what does this say urt urt eyes up here eyes up here good what does this say er good what does this say urse and what does this say erve okay these are the same cards that you have so we re going to make some words okay okay first we re going to start with urt u r t so let s pull that down to where it says rhyme u r t okay and i want you to make the word hurt hurt good job all right let s spell hurt together h u r t hurt very good all right so miss dodd will pull down my h and it looks like everybody got that okay now i want you to take your u r pull down your u r okay and this time i m going to give you a clue i want you to make the word that is something that is on an animal covers an animal keeps him warm his what we don t want our h right now let s see if you can figure it out you should have u r right here okay and now we re going to so what was the answer to my clue fur fur spell it f u r fur keep your u r and i want you to make the word spur spur we talked about this word last week a spur okay yes who put the things out i did okay who remembers what a spur is something that you kick very good here s a picture of a spur remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and it makes the horse go fast okay so i should pull down my s p and this word is spur very good all right i want you to pull down your u r s e u r s e and you shouldn t have anything in front of the u r s e you should just have it just like madison has it here she doesn t have anything for onset she only has her rhyme okay all right what does that part say urse urse okay i want you to add a p and see what word you get and if you have a d you might want to flip it over it s also a p okay all right what word is that purse purse very good okay i want you to take your i r and pull it down and this time i want you to make your own word with i r it might not be the same word your neighbor makes i want you to make your own word with i r look at all the onset parts that you have and see what you can add to ir good job all right let s look at what we came up with what did you come up with sir sir okay so i ll pull down my s here this word is sir that is correct and i see a few people have sir let s see let s look at this one what did you make spir but what two letters actually say ur in spur i r not i r remember u r yep let s put it up here so we remember it spur is s p u r i ve got another one all right dirt okay oh yeah how do you spell dirt oh yeah wait oh yeah we might not have that ending but do you know how to spell dirt d i r t very good all right let s move on to another one oh i see that you have g i r gir what were you thinking when you wrote that can you use that in a sentence no okay this one is not a word okay now we re going to pull out our e r v e e r v e let s see how quickly we can get it up you all are doing a good job you re all probably going to get another point e r v e okay and i want you to fill in the blank the ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food the ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food what can we put in front of the e r v e that would complete that sentence it s got to make sense all right what is this word erve let s see what if i were to put an s what word would i have serve serve does that make sense in my sentence do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food yeah so what word did we come up with serve serve very good okay so this is what i want you to do i want you to take all your cards just like miss dodd s doing here and i m just going to put them together pretty quick i don t have to really take my time here and then i m going to stick them on my page we re going to make a pile in the middle good job all right good and remember it doesn t have to be perfect good job and let s take it all is this yours good job no all right i m going to go ahead and hand you our story we re going to take what we ve learned and take it to text we re going to read a story that has lots of words that have the er sound this looks like i have one yeah that one s his curls that swirl all right i can t put it whoa it s got 12 pages okay all right let me go ahead and take those so we can go ahead and start reading okay okay you can give the students a point because you did a good job last time okay i m going to give everybody a highlighter because as we re reading i want you highlighting words that have the er sound okay so what s my title curls that swirl very good do you see some words that have the er sound yes ma am let s highlight them what s my first word curls u r curls what s my next word that has er swirl swirl very good all right curls that swirl what are they talking about about curls what kind of curls are they talking about like curls in your hair curls in your hair very good okay as we re going i m going to be putting the words up here okay so we have curls and we have swirl and we will use these words again tomorrow okay so let s open up to the first page miss dodd miss dodd highlight it again no highlighting yet okay cheryl oh okay well come up no no we re on this page here page three at the bottom okay okay okay so let s see how quickly we can get to page three all right what we re going to do is i want you following along miss dodd s going to model how we re going to read this page as i m reading you can highlight when i say an er word does everybody understand the directions yes ma am okay but you need to be listening because after this we re going to read it all together okay here we go once there was a small girl who had hair that curled and swirled and twirled drop where you hand is i messed up that s okay we ll go back and look at it this one we ll talk about it it swirled over her shirt and way past her skirt okay now stop no no we re going to just look at that one page because i see some things that make me ask some questions what word did you ask me about that wasn t me did you ask me about a word what word there there okay let s look at the word there okay now should we highlight there yes ma am raise your hand if you say yes we should raise your hand if you say no we shouldn t okay well let s look at it does it have e r like we re looking for yes it does but does it say er no no it has a different sound every e r isn t going to say er it s just going to be special times so in this case should we highlight it no no okay and it s okay if you did okay all right let s go ahead and read it together now everybody follow along let s put our finger under the first word or your highlighter is fine,0.0
trying to find meaning for their lives or were they just trying to what were they questing for do you think well gilgamesh was questing for like immortality and that was for him and not really his people but theseus i think was i don t know i think theseus was just trying to help the people of athens i don t think either of them were really looking to find that but they both ended up finding it i think both of them were like looking to help their people and then i also think like a small part of them was looking for glory i think it s kind of like looking for their destiny like they know they re meant for something bigger but they don t know what it is yet so they re just looking for what that is so then he goes to take the test and the test kills him or not then he goes back to his father and he realizes that he s just like you know the father s really disappointed in the son and then he s really disappointed until the son i think it could happen in today s society i don t know about gilgamesh well yeah it was a really like abstract connecting in the really broad sense it could happen but like like the story line but when you look at details then like no but i mean minotaurs don t exist so it probably couldn t happen but like you were saying like metaphorically it could be something that you know like the storyline could happen but metaphorically you could compare anything that s true can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically like me no the only one was like you mean hypothetical theseus not like he goes and fights a minotaur and when he comes back he s like not dead but his dad thinks he s dead and kills himself but it s like haley said i guess thanks if you have like a test and like you re bad like a difficult situation in general yeah and like your dad or parents or someone are like you can get through this like you can beat it and they think that you or like they think that you fail it or like catastrophe fail it or they think you do then they re gonna be kind of disappointed in you but like they re not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test but still you can laugh if it was someone else but maybe like on the inside he s dying yeah your turn okay i just said what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times well the probably the whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed at least like in the to the culture like the gods and goddesses aren t like a you know big deal yeah i think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are not like in charge but that are higher up in our society like the government people and like parents and i just think more like mentors in general yeah like people that are higher than us like anyone technically could like you know that you look up to that you rely on for help it s like a figure rather than like yeah a physical yeah god god yeah well my question was show the similarities and differences between theseus and his father ooh okay so i think like they both kind of they re very different in their terms of like loss and like failure because like when theseus s dad like thought that he was like dead then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide but when like theseus like was with ariadne or whatever and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur then he just kind of you know left her on an island i think that i don t really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on crete seven maidens and seven children but like i just think that because that happens and because he does that every year i think theseus is a better leader he s just like better in charge of i think that they re definitely like different rulers too because like theseus is more like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against thebes but doesn t try to like most people would like try to steal stuff from the city but he s just going to like bury the dead and then he leaves so like that s more of a nicer leader i guess whereas his dad wasn t really like put in that situation but i m guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city and not include people very often it says that because he lived with his mom so he didn t want to have a son so then when he could lift the rock then he could come over and meet his dad is this question number no we re still asking predict what would happen if king aegeus and enkidu hadn t died if the king hadn t died i think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after and there would have been no like not formed you know what i m talking about because king aegeus no but he would have died sometime and then theseus would have taken over yeah that s true can you go dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy what did you mean by that oh just like right when king aegeus died theseus came over and said we re going to have a democracy instead of me ruling over all of you so like we don t know if that would have happened or because if he just would have stayed alive he could have like changed theseus mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea mm hmm yeah he would ve wanted him to be he would have that as king he would ve been more like his dad yeah that s true but if enkidu didn t die then gilgamesh would probably like be happy and then like conquer a bunch of other stuff and like they would probably like die together she could have sent him to athens to claim him as his oh okay nevermind you re allowed to go on all right no if enkidu didn t die though i just think that gilgamesh wouldn t have really known like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning i think he still was kind of arrogant until enkidu died so he he would have stayed like that yeah he would have stayed that way mm hmm because he went through like a stage of depression so yeah do you think that each one reached humility at the end or no do you think that gilgamesh you said was still arrogant even at the end no oh he wasn t not after enkidu died but once he died it stopped of course but i think gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn t going to be immortal well yeah that too because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn t live forever he couldn t do whatever he wanted who s your favorite character between each story out of the stories theseus yeah i like theseus too we all like theseus yeah it also said that theseus was grieving was grieving her loss or his father s loss it was both debate which character had more impact on their society can you say that one more time debate which character had more impact on their society oh she has the debate word in there okay let s hear it i d say gilgamesh i would say he wants to be king let s let him finish his reason what s your reason you think who i think gilgamesh actually i think theseus would because he changed the kind of structure of government and made it democratic that s it yeah i would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived while kind of gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story while theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind that people remembered on high rather than as like a low point of their society weren t you going to say something oh i was i thought you were i think theseus was had an impact and the reason for that because he like survived more than gilgamesh did and he helped people out of the maze with adrian s help right yeah predict what would happen if the king and enkidu didn t die well i don t think athens would be democratic i don t think the king would have done it yeah he probably would have been poisoned why is that gilgamesh i don t know because gilgamesh probably wouldn t have been searching for immortality yeah he wouldn t have gone on that journey yeah okay well my question is how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through wait what was the question how would you have handled the situations wouldn t have done any of them no i get scared really easily and stressed so that would not be good the labyrinth thing sorry i didn t hear what you said i wouldn t go to the labyrinth thing why is that it kind of sounds like a bad idea i might go and just not defeat the beast and in the first place i probably would have traveled by water and not just said i m too good for that it s too easy because i bandits have sharp swords yeah okay what s yours choose your favorite character and explain why from because you like gilgamesh or theseus okay oh not like our favorite character just in the story yeah well either way it doesn t really matter well because my favorite character from gilgamesh was enkidu is that how you say it because i think he like really changed gilgamesh for the better and helped him and humbled him do you agree with that yeah i agree with that because i feel like he was kind of like gilgamesh was so awful and like enkidu came in and just changed all that plus i thought that it was kind of cool his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy yeah i don t think that enkidu really meant to change gilgamesh though i think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen enkidu s mom kind of made that happen too didn t he did you feel like enkidu was just kind of created that he i mean we were saying that we like him but did he seem real to you or was he just something created see when i read it the entire time he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix gilgamesh so he didn t really have that much of a personality to me so that s my opinion i don t know yeah he seemed like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out gilgamesh and he did yeah he did my favorite character from these stories was ariadne oh well because i didn t feel sorry for her because she helped theseus and like without her he would have been trapped in the labyrinth but then to repay her he just ditched her on an island and just left her so that wasn t very nice so i feel sorry for her that s why okay mine is how would you have dealt with these situations in can you repeat it one more time how would you have handled these situa i wouldn t run away from the i would not have gone on this journey i probably just would have stayed home not gonna lie do you feel like that people to be great have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements that that s what greatness is not necessarily i don t think you necessarily have to seek them it all really depends on what your definition of greatness is i feel like to get that like glory and all that i mean i think you can do that if you have enough impact where you are you don t need to go off on a journey what do you think dinesh i don t know i feel like if we re going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories that obviously you don t have to i don t think you have to seek greatness necessarily i don t think you have to seek it to find it but i think that you do have to go off if you re just going to stay where you are you re not really going to be able to achieve it so if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by that s not greatness that can t constitute,0.0
so how is that energy different things like jules which are increments which are similar kilowatts hours and bcu okay you could also measure it with a thermometer if it s kinetic energy sometimes okay i have an cubic feet tons and gallons too that s mass and volume oh cause it was like hold on totally different thing i don t remember while she s looking at that what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about well there are no no explosions that s a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power oh i have and it states in lots of articles about nuclear waste that it produces very little waste at all well i have a cubic feet it s for like natural gas tons is measured for coal kilowatts hours is for electricity it doesn t pollute the air you could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it and then the disadvantages for geothermal energy is the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15 which isn t it s not that great and there s a limitation of it you can t just like keep reusing it and reusing it i think that would be like a possibility for a scenario but like we don t know if it s warm enough to be able to do that yeah if there was a good spot around our area it might be good but how would you know if your area was a good spot i don t know they would have to do tests and stuff plus i don t know that people would want it in their backyard it s hard because cranberry if we re thinking of where those people well like a civilized area people really don t want something that smells bad yeah that they don t want any disruption and where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from there are inside of the earth right but it s inside of the earth but it comes out in what ways in geysers in geysers or what else i m not sure volcanoes oh yeah so who that s definitely something you don t have volcanoes everywhere either yeah right and you definitely wouldn t want that in your backyard and sometimes if there would be a good area maybe the state or the country would buy the property to like put it there because it s a good spot sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff they like buy the property okay okay i had hydro electric and some of the pros that is it doesn t pollute at all and the actual running of the power plant is really cheap and then it s really reliable so say there was a big power outage in the area the hydro electric power plant could get that running again but it s run by building dams in rivers and they re extremely expensive to build which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that a different a business or something but it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals and people and houses i have a question for you do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here i don t think you could necessarily use the creek the connoquenessing yeah but yeah you have to have like a big river and it has to be fairly out of the way would it like cause flooding yeah you couldn t have any houses really upstream because could they d flood and for example your science book says that the hoover dam which is on the colorado river it created a waterfall of 400 feet which is more than twice as high as the niagara falls so you re talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop because the water creates the kinetic energy am i saying that right yeah and that s what causes the electricity correct so if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here that might that might work and again the whole yeah the three rivers that could do it because there s a bunch of big rivers in pittsburgh yeah yeah but if you build that up wouldn t that flood well not in the middle of the city you could maybe do it like out of the city cause the rivers aren t just like in the city they go out and also if you have a good area flooding wouldn t matter so much if you pick the right area which i mean i guess the whole thing so definitely not in cranberry here where we live well we get a lot of rain around here so i m just like flooding would be like a problem yeah we re sort of in a drought right now there s not been a big rain for a long time does it harm the animals that are in the river it s better for farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there s more fish and stuff but there s less plants and stuff like upstream it floods the animals and homes and so it doesn t really hurt too much down stream i guess it depends because the farmers need deeper waters but not if there s less life in it because that s what they re trying to achieve rachel tell us about yours my energy is fossil fuels the pros were that it s the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use it s easy to find if you know in the general area of where it s at it makes up half or more of our energy in the united states the cons are that it s non renewable there s a limited supply it makes a lot of pollution when it s mined it s expensive to transport it harms aquatic life with pollution it takes millions of years to form that s something i didn t know about fossil fuels that it takes a very long time to develop it has to be like compacted uh huh so maybe the big plant it might be able to not might be able it would probably run out fast if we started using it a lot so there wouldn t be a point in making this huge plant and then it just run out yeah so it might be something people would use more often in the future just little by little like just for little things what do you mainly use it for like energy but like what falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels coals and oils and natural gas yeah yeah and you said it when you mine it so we would have to transport it here there s so many people that live here that wouldn t want that isn t that what happened in mexico what s that called the gulf of mexico yeah weren t they mining for fossil fuels like oil oil yeah and that happens so that s like a natural disaster and that s happened a bunch of times so it s not that safe so for our scenario what do you think would be the best two maybe nuclear around here out of the way a little so it wouldn t create any huge explosions so thermal energy transfers into electrical energy so it s kind of like biomass cause they both you burn both of them except yours you use mine s not renewable yeah yours you use like uhm what s it called like plants fossilized plants and stuff and for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that actually isn t the isn t the fossilized or fossil fuels or whatever don t they keep on making them yeah fossilized yeah but it can t it takes so long to make them because you need all the pressure and the decomposing like plants and animals that once it runs out it s going to take a while for us to get more like thousands of years it takes to replenish yeah it takes a long time yeah it takes a very long time for sure so i think keeton i don t think yours would be the best for our community to use it s running out anyway yeah so how much pollution does it cause a lot why does the world just use it if it s running out why waste it we talked about the efficiency what s the efficiency cost of fossil fuels i wasn t sure i couldn t find the exact uh 38 to 47 that s actually really good cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something so that may have something to do with what your decision is right the efficiency of the energy i think so i just you should save some of it you don t need to save it but it s not that good of an idea to rely on this energy source that s not going to last forever that s why i say you could also use that as a backup plan because if we use something that s renewable like katelyn s or something but something like a disaster happens that could always be our just our fall back that we know we could use that if we have to just like an emergency generator it s like you know it s there if you need it you can use it and it can last for a little bit since it is running out would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case oh definitely save it save it i say save it too now i actually think save it because i think probably save it i would say to save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you ll be able to go back to it but if you use it all then you couldn t go back to it so what are you all proposing as your primary energy source biomass okay cause it doesn t cause that much pollution and then they harness that pollution like katelyn said they capture it and then they use it for different things like growing trees or cause the only thing that the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide and they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff wow interesting yeah i thought that was pretty good so i think katelyn s definitely provides the most for the community definitely out of all yeah i have high effiecency rates so you ll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it yeah the colorado river isn t actually renewable energy s that good of an efficiency rating actually actually the the hydro electric energy is nearly 95 efficient wow once you build it since tidal doesn t use any fuel either it s just once you built it but the down side on building is it costs so much so i don t understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things you could do it to create more biomass like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil plant roots or plants just try to find research to make that happen more quickly speed up the process so it wouldn t be a non renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything there s no they said the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that they only create like a small amount of energy and so we can t really do that in silicone valley what about the three rivers in pittsburgh could we not somehow harness that we were talking about that i was like talking about redirecting the river redirecting the river just making one big one yeah i think that we would be able to use the three rivers in pittsburgh because they re all pretty big rivers so if we just put like one dam in there and then we harness the energy from all three i think that we could get a lot of energy from it i don t think it d be enough energy like to completely rely on it i think that we d still have to use other resources to still create energy because i know the title it only creates 10 hours of energy a day but i don t know if that means like an hour of that energy runs like a power plant it didn t exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing so i don t i don t think that d be a good idea to completely rely on that and put it in the three rivers and doesn t then the with the title energy too there has to be a difference in the the low and high difference in the low and the high yeah three meters of low and high yeah so where did you find out where in the world there is that difference yeah they said the biggest title it was in france or something but we don t have any in the united states because we don t have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference oh wow so there s none used in the united states and i don t think we could use that then well what you were saying before about how like each energy source we basically have to fall back on another one yeah because none of them we could completely rely on to supply all of our energy i think that we would definitely need at least two choices at least two and if we had to pick two i would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way yeah like you only need a little bit and it can produce a lot of energy and the efficiency rating s pretty high it s like 35 so yeah wow that is pretty high remember you said it was like really hazardous yeah it doesn t produce a lot of air pollution or greenhouse gases but if like one small accident is made then it can cause like a really big disaster which would be bad for a community of people since there are so many people in it i think that katelyn and kelsey were talking about like different kinds of energy sources and according to issels uh issues,0.0
from the top this way starting from the top woo hoo that went better can we have a ruler yeah 75 okay make sure you record it 75 what 75 cm c m what s c m stand for centimeters centimeters okay now we ve got to get the average i m gonna do the average go ahead go to your next one i m gonna check on the next group okay no you don t put 75 for all of them i m not just on that one we knew it wouldn t go any farther just put 75 for the first one second part trial two now what do we do okay go ahead tell me what you found out what did you discover about bubble wrap sand paper wax paper and just the plain ramp on the bubble wrap it didn t go because it was a bumpy surface because all the bumps because it was too bumpy and had to much friction too much friction okay and so what did you discover sean i discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower what do you mean by that higher and lower and higher can you explain that a different way to me well so what does that say about the surface increase and decrease spencer what did you discover so so it went farther on plain wrap versus the wax paper yeah okay so right now you re going to find the average right how are you gonna find the average like 32 plus plus 30 plus 41 divided by three okay you guys go ahead and do that who s going to be the calculator i am you are okay i might suggest someone else also be the calculator so you can compare your numbers and then i m gonna come back and talk to you about your results okay okay let s sit down let s see what your doing it s not going very good on the sand paper because it s just like the carpet why won t it go as far on sandpaper because it s like the carpet okay what does that tell you about friction that if it s sand paper it doesn t have a lot of contact it rubs against the rug it rubs against the tires i think it doesn t one person at a time paul because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn t have a lot of friction if it did have a lot of friction it would go faster okay so does sand paper have friction or not yes or no no no yes what is friction one person at a time it s like whoosh that s friction hm okay can you explain what is your idea stephen friction when a car rolls on carpet it s friction because it slows it down sand paper slows it down too so far what have you discovered about friction and wax paper versus sand paper wax paper let s let stephen tell me okay wax paper is kinda like it s probably gonna be like the look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far because you already recorded them it s the highest so far what does that mean it s the highest so far it s the one that has the least amount of friction it has the least amount of friction okay and how do you know that because we did the experiment and what happened it didn t go as far it didn t go as far on what okay go ahead an finish your experiment go ahead and finish on the plain ramp you have one more to do i see here okay and then we ll talk about what we should do next oh 39 that s showing you more about fourth dimension let s talk about our results talk about your results that you ve noticed sh stephen tanner i need to be able to hear this group okay we found now that our total averaged out to 85cm for our total average okay what does this tell you look at your averages what does this tell you about friction that friction slows you down like the salt slows you down on ice like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice it makes you go faster right and you know what it s doing outside right now what is it doing outside right now it s sleeting it s sleeting it s snowing and the roads are very very slick so what do you think s gonna be a great idea because i know my husband s coming home from work tonight the roads are gonna be slippery what s gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer what should the road crews do salt they can put salt and salt and sand salt and sand yes why so it didn t go at all i wonder if it was small little bubble wrap if it would work better what do you think i think if they were popped oh if they were popped i wonder if they would maybe so okay down here you have a graph that we re gonna talk about a little bit later but this is what i want you to do i want you to pretend like you re a teacher and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did what would you tell them i want you to write it on the back of here what s one thing that you ve learned today that you would teach someone and then we re gonna talk about it okay i want you to talk about it when you re done writing talk about it with each other and i ll be back in a minute okay we can share when we re done writing or we can share them as we write them so what would we tell someone i would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower what would you say i would say the rougher the surface the more friction i would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying except a little bit different i would say it depends on which kind of surface it is if it s bumpy it won t go if there s bumps and air all over on it if it s a smooth and soft surface it will probably go a lot faster so tell me what you are you still writing we all shared it okay but i want to see it in writing like i want to see something written down i said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes okay spencer what are you gonna write because i m gonna write kind of the same thing as heather is there anything your gonna change about it or add to it i m gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less and the less further it goes okay i like that i think you guys are learning a lot about this sean i see your writing something a little bit different what are you writing i m writing the smoother the surface the farther the car goes you guys are right the farther it goes because why because the friction because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go but on a smoother surface barely any what what word is she looking for she said on a smoother surface there s barely any friction and i like what you said you said a smooth surface is like ice a smooth surface is like ice right i said the bumpier the surface the more friction right but you also said something that if it was a smooth surface it s kinda like ice there s no friction to keep it from like if it s outside today if it s ice your car could go anywhere but putting sand down or the salt keeps it less friction more it has more friction okay okay go ahead and finish what what do you want i wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice oh so how would be do that i like that how would we do it when it s like an icy day or something and there s a little bit of ice somewhere we could bring the car out or something not like a real car oh okay just like a play car and try it out try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice how could we change this experiment what could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out i think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap we talked about that popped bubble wrap and what else did you say the bubble wrap could be what talk about that the bubble wrap could be what guys i need you to not come in here you can use un popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile and you probably use like a grid with the marbles instead you can like use a car okay talk about that to see if it would fall off now what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off with force and motion how does that tie in well what i mean is will it like go far if you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not like if it was on the it depends how fast it would go if it went faster would it fall off but if we re talking about friction does this have anything to do with friction oh i love that so wood carpet and ice and we could freeze ice because we have big containers,0.0
i see lots of different levels of tennis i see some balancing levels blake why do you choose to balance this who wants to share keeping that ball controlled back to back catching placement find a partner and standing with equipment on the ground i ve got two groups ready equipment s on the ground you re looking for somebody you may have not worked with already you should have found a partner if not you guys will start thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground lost and found lost and found always come to the start very good when i say go you re going to turn to your partner i want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity what i have on the board over here and i also have it on my screen lifetime activity what does it mean to have a lifetime activity what does the word lifetime mean go bryan soccer baseball maybe not soccer maybe one of those yeah maybe it could be yeah soccer volleyball yeah volleyball and five four three two and one my partner and i zachary had some really good examples of what lifetime means so i m gonna use his zachary said that lifetime means you do it now as a third grader but we could do it later in life as an adult raise your hand if that s what you and your partner kinda said it s something you should be able to do later in life very good and then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life zachary said two cool ones tennis anybody else say tennis awesome pat yourself on the back and he also said bowling and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader and later in life is that they re pretty good on your body you can still do em they re not gonna injure your body too much it s gonna make you strong and healthy we have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out we ve talked about aerobic capacity and tennis will make your heart beat faster you have to find something that s gonna make the heart beat faster so now turn to your partner talk about what you re gonna choose to make your heart beat faster go and five four three two one pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity that you re gonna choose nice job when i say go you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face off position so this is where my partner and i came and we put our equipment down then we ll turn and look at the board ready go looking for an open spot with a partner thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly now we re transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges so far we ve worked by ourselves to be responsible learners brian are you looking for your partner he s right here so now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners on the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday zachary and ms rock will show you an example of what you could practice we re gonna actually skip this level today but you could choose it if you said hey you know what let s go back to this other level so zachary and ms rock both have our rackets we re gonna practice underhand striking keep up raise your hand if you remember that awesome alright here it is i tick step tock and he s gonna strike back or he can catch it and then i m gonna keep striking we re gonna keep our paddles low go ahead alright i m gonna wait til it gets low so i can strike he s gonna also wait til it gets low to strike keeping that paddle low we re trying to keep it up as long as we can awesome so that was the first level striking keep up with the balloon now we re gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner super duper cool it looks like this only one person will need a bean bag since i m closest to the wall i m the person to have the bean bag first i m going to be the underhand thrower zachary go ahead and pick up your racket create a flat surface i m going to underhand throw he s going to catch it on his racket take a step tock good try you might have to reach out and get under it now he s gonna leave it on his racket and he s gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands go ahead take a step tock i catch alright he needs to have three tries with the racket then it s my turn to have three tries with the racket thumbs up if you understand down if you got a question alright person closest to the wall you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag bring it back and place it in your racket go quickly quickly and five four three two one you should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket raise your hand if you have a question so partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up you re the tosser first with your hands you only need the beanbag you only have the beanbag grab your place on your side thank you christopher for being safe we re gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly we re gonna see how far we get we re gonna be responsible if the beanbag is not working so well you can go back to a balloon balloon alright let s practice go one catching on their racket one catching on their hand i hear good communication with a partner you have to help each other one person is underhand throwing one person is catching awesome if you haven t switched jobs go ahead and switch jobs at this time if you haven t switched jobs see how many good catches you can get give yourself a point for each catch hands or racket are you using the opposite foot to step back with both partners pick up rackets both partners pick up rackets look at the board now you re gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge count how many you can get go there you go zach excellent one and freeze alright from here i m going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners we have learned to use a bean bag with a partner we re gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball and a large tennis trainer both of these offer different challenges the first one is a foam ball as you can see on the screen they now have a foam ball zachary picks up his racket we are doing an underhand strike back and forth but like we did with the tennis ball we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to so zachary do you think if i tossed this to you you could try catching it alright let s see nice he had to figure out how to keep that balance on here he s gonna do the same thing back to me this is just working on looking for that ball getting our feet to it and keeping a flat surface we can do the catching with the ball now we re ready for the tap offs remember what we did with the balloon we re gonna try to keep the foam ball up this is what it looks like tap tap good try it went away a little bit stop it we come back i tick step tock good we re keeping a flat surface coming back slanted out the lower the racket the better control we will have i want the racket to stay at a slant to partner can you say that slant to partner so that s the foam ball challenge some of you may just stay with the foam ball but if you re like i wanna challenge myself and my partner i say zachary we can now use the tennis trainer and it s going to bounce strike bounce strike the bouncing is gonna bounce here before i hit it then it will bounce in the middle then my partner will strike okay ready zachary so it s a bounce strike bounce strike excellent and i would come back and start it over again if i need to bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike catch when needed were we controlled yeah when it got out of control we caught it so from here on out you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with bean bag what came next foam ball and then tennis trainer excellent see how far you get with the partner you re working with this uses communication and cooperation say that communication and cooperation excellent this is how it would look zachary what piece of equipment would you like for us to use or you think you re ready the the foam ball or the balloon what did you say the end one the end he said he wanted to use the tennis trainer w for wilson it s the brand i said oh you know what zachary i don t feel like i m ready for this one can we go back to a foam ball first and he said yes i m all phew thank you we just had communication and cooperation i know that i can practice with this one for a little longer i ll probably be ready for the challenge alright ready go are you able to keep your paddles low keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled are you using an underhand strike alright ready zachary bounce strike bounce strike let it bounce one time bounce strike bounce strike good bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike now i m going to give you a challenge so i can go around the room and see if anyone needs help you ll just work on tap ups you can use any equipment that you need okay tap ups or tap downs if you and your partner need a little help you can always raise your hand and i can come over try to review those cues with you underhand strike okay bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike okay say that bounce strike okay and if it s not working then you and your partner need to say we need to go back to the be responsible try it again though bounce strike bounce strike ooh this is where aiyah did she step with her opposite foot did you step when you strike no so it s key to step when you strike you gotta step try it again keeping those paddles low if you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot that s a reflection you should say ooh we a need help or b let s go to a different level responsible word i hear which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with and freeze equipment should be back on our rackets now i see students at all different levels so that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class which is excellent but now we re gonna see if you can switch it up a bit and give yourself a challenge you should be able to work with anybody so what i m gonna have you do is let s see here ellie ellie is gonna step over here come jogging down all the way down to where zachary is yay ellie ellie is gonna slide down one and that s gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner where you going very good zachary and then you go one down yep there you go now wave to your new partner excellent same thing here harrison come on down and slide on down wave to your new partner now you all of a sudden have to have more communication because you don t know where this partner is at ready go talk which one are you gonna do,0.0
yeah i have a question it says how does the skip predictions move on yeah olympic athletes how does your data compare to olympic athletes how does your data compare to the class average yeah do we do the predictions it does help to have somebody look at it with you sometimes it s not as obvious as you think scott we re going to stay on task right good we re not doing predictions right no so take a look at patterns what you want to do for this question is look at patterns do you see any patterns there okay good it s not necessarily worse by the way it s definitely different it s worse skye if you re like dead if we re talking about heart rate and yours is worse so we still have a little bit to learn how that affects you if you are inactive or not so let s look at the pattern there you see that that s kind of what i was thinking you just missed that one again one of the things we can talk about then is data collection exactly come on let s go it s not the same numbers it s the same pattern right good any patterns that you guys are seeing back there yeah a little bit what might that be this is science be more specific are there any patterns for number four you guys skipped it it s okay yeah four you don t have to do predictions you compare to athletes don t do it for predictions but do it for your class data and athletes okay now that s a perfect simple question now we take that information and put it into number six hopefully you re going to make the mental jump that we need here what does heart rate have to do with homeostasis if we challenged our body with a little bit of exercise you know how heart rates work now the question is why how does that keep us alive there you go good how much more time do we need did you get this one right if you guys did then you understand the process hands down congratulations make sure you share your answers make it quick i don t want people in and out we good how about a drink here you go we got it it s good no i ve got it covered okay two more minutes remain in your seats number six there you go you re good good job scott you re very subtle and very helpful thank you remember we ve got a mic that s on there all right got two more thirty more seconds right then you re back in your own seats if you can do six you re the best ten seconds or so get in your own seats for the next ten seconds two things are going to happen we re going to start off with simple answers then we re going build upon them and then hopefully we ll get to the more creative ones at the end this class we have enough time to do that so let s do that right off the bat question one daryl can you read it or would you prefer to have somebody else read it i can read it okay good what is the hypothesis being tested okay so let s talk about it in our experiment we were looking to get something measured what is a valid hypothesis for this experiment scott we ve got and then alicia alicia let s go how does exercise affect your heart rate good now that s a step in the right direction the hypothesis has got to include the concept alicia and anybody in her group want to help her out it s got to include the concept of homeostasis so can we do that can we tale a look at our aim a look at our model hypothesis how does exercise affect heart rate that s a good start anybody else have something else different that would support our understanding of homeostasis you re yawning you okay all right let s sit up thank you little bit more good good like you re playing third base okay matt good let s sit back now there you go got it anybody else go ahead if we do exercise then our heart rate will change okay so that s kind of what alicia said go ahead it should keep going up and then when you re not it goes down again a great great hypothesis if we were at a third or fourth grade level that s something we want to do but we re not at third or fourth grade it s a tenth grade class here i want you to get out of your seventh grade minds and add this concept of regulation you want to try how does homeostasis affect your heart rate how does homeostasis affect your heart rate think about that okay you want to reword that which causes which oh how does your heart rate affect homeostasis good but now we ve got to remember we combined exercise in this kevin how does your heart rate change to meet the needs of your muscles and cells in the body you didn t use the word homeostasis but how does your heart change to meet the needs of your cells and your heart in your body excellent i don t need you to write that i just need you to understand that s the direction we re going you want to try now i had almost the same thing i put heart rate changing throughout exercise to the needs of homeostasis homeostasis now you guys are closer on it so this is about how does your body adapt itself even when stress with exercise to maintain balance to maintain homeostasis in the beginning of this unit you guys remember i had the balance board up here how many of you got on it i forget one person two people that s it three people do you remember how hard that was to do did we throw things at the people yeah was that easier or harder to stay balanced when that was happening harder no i thought it was like easier what s the room for error how easy is it for one of the sides to touch or how not easy is it it s very easy same with homeostasis that margin of error we re in a small range here if i take your temperature dustin and it s healthy not healthy okay 98 6 no but what if you re 102 what if you re that tell you you want to try so 98 6 is normal but what if somebody takes your temperature and you re at 100 degrees or it s not normal you want to give me a word for that sick you would be sick you d have a fever something would be wrong with you you would be not normal right good that s a small number 98 6 and if you have 101 you ve got to see a doctor or something you ve got to get rest you ve got to get medicine you ve got to do something to help your body heal all right number one done number two and three daryl you did a good job reading the first one richie can i ask you to read the second one sure what are the controls in the experiment okay so controls another word for controls anybody real quick independent variables no not at all constants things that don t change so above the word controls can you guys write the word constants things that stay the same so savannah good good opportunity for you to learn okay so when we say controls we re talking about the exact opposite of a variable which is a thing that changes everything stays the same or constant what are some the examples of the constants that you have in this experiment the controls go ahead the three categories the three categories we mentioned everybody in the same three categories okay go ahead the amount of time you re giving us and how much time was that do you remember two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes the amount of time was the same the temperature temperature in the stairway good because if you were going to talk about your own temperature actually that changes again that s a whole other topic about homeostasis that when we exercise we start sweating right so you re talking about the temperature in the exact place okay anybody else go ahead where we exercise and then the height of the stairs like if one stair was higher than the other then it would be harder right all the steps are the same now here s a control one kid said in my last class and the other kids disagreed with him he said the exercise was the control that we all did the same thing no do you remember what we did we walked the stairs did we all walk the stairs the same way no well some of you kids hustled right like two minutes you were like bunnies like gerbils on the stairway you were just going crazy others were just walking and it was okay good let s move on three independent and dependent variables that would be helpful thank you for your hand up we only need one answer of the two and somebody else will give the other one so dependent or independent whatever you want heart rate is the dependent variable upstairs okay one second one second so tell me a little bit more though daryl is it heart rate and how do we measure the heart rate take a look at your graph your dependent variable is going to be very well described on your graph help me out go ahead okay you re looking at it somebody want to help him out what is the dependent variable of this he s close but he s not close enough to be right savannah number of heart beats per minute per minute you had to have the per minute on that okay that s the standard that we use in science independent variable kelsey would you like to try i m not sure i know it okay that s okay what did we introduce in this experiment to affect our heart rate to see if we could stay balanced exercise bingo so your independent variable exercise exercise two minutes of exercise is what we did very good your back group you have another one or it s all up here okay four how does your data compare to the olympic athletes how does your personal data compare to the class now remember we re scientists so you just can t say it went up and then it went down or whatever you can say that but it s got to be justified with some sort of specific numbers richie had his hand up first okay justine okay go ahead my heart rate predictions were very low because i didn t have any idea and then my actual heart rate was higher than the olympic athletes because they re used to running a lot okay here s a good example of what i m talking about first of all what you did with predictions is great we didn t actually have to even do that one for this question but that s great richie when you say they were higher what do you mean your resting rate was higher your post exercise rate was higher your recovery rate was higher all of them okay you ve got to include them in your answer you have to include that in your answer you ve got to be specific go ahead matt margaret you re next okay yeah go ahead my prediction i had low numbers but after doing the experiment only one of my numbers was lower than the olympic athletes okay so again what was that one number post exercise post exercise was lower wow that s rare by the way did you see the class data compared to you then we weren t supposed to do the prediction but i m getting so many hits here how many of you to a look at your prediction compared to other people quite a few people you guys when you were doing this you asked me what s the normal range and i didn t tell you i wonder what you would say your prediction is after i gave you a range i purposely didn t just to let you see just like you said mine was off because i didn t know any better good all right five super important question here oh i m so sorry does anyone else want to contribute to the olympic athletes i m so sorry go ahead my actual heart rate was higher than the olympic athletes but for the exercise one it was only seven heart beats lower okay so what does that mean to you how close to an olympic athlete are you is what i m asking i guess it could be exercise like with the olympic athletes i know it wouldn t be like anything for them for me to be like that far off is kind of like impressive right and how would you know that didn t you say you had like a cousin who does crew does crew at the olympic level or just does crew she does crew at an olympic level wow a premiere athlete then fantastic what s crew crew is when you row a shell or row a boat there s singles doubles and quads oh yeah fantastic anybody else before we move on christina and then scott i noticed that we re just like like i realized we re all like the same because when the olympic athletes went up class average went up and ours went up so i noticed it was the same pattern just like depending on what we were doing it was different than the olympics and all that stuff that s the big picture i want everybody to see here take a look at your graphs one more time do you agree with what christina just said forget about your prediction number did you see that there s a pattern here no matter who you are as an individual in this class or as a class average or as olympic athletes when we exposed our body to exercise what happened in all cases it went up so we would say it increased okay what happened when we rested post exercise yes it decreased it decreased right so there is a general pattern excellent job christina go ahead scott make it quick i had the same thing as her okay good all right key question if we can answer six we ve got this lesson down pat when muscles are active cells use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate and produce waste chemicals and heat more rapidly what does heart rate how does heart rate demonstrate regulation homeostasis in the body i ve got three hands up i didn t see the order i m sorry so i m going to go four or five hands up i got one maybe two i don t know gabby three go ahead richie if someone leaves something out it s yours when you re exercising like you re using more nutrients and oxygen so the blood has to carry more nutrients at a faster rate so your muscles get it it does that to maintain homeostasis so it s like using it constantly okay daryl she did a good job i m going to change the question for you what if your body didn t do that what if you re running up and down the stairs daryl and your heart rate didn t increase it would have a hard time maintaining homeostasis okay excellent and what would happen what do you think you d be dehydrated and wouldn t sweat or anything well i don t know if you d be dehydrated you wouldn t get as much oxygen because it wouldn t be working as fast and you wouldn t be like so it might get stuck in there while you re running up and down,0.0
welcome to our kindergarten classroom the library is the heart of our room where books are labeled and sorted by genre and reading level to facilitate student self selection this is also where we display author studies current student work and student made literacy charts this is where we have our writing center more level texts classroom volunteer supplies and a lending library math work is on display and student portfolios are organized and easily accessible we have a few tables to facilitate guided instruction and small group learning our schedule and calendar are housed in this part of the room and we have a message board which is portable and used for modeled and interactive reading and writing our learning center s chart organizes student movement around the classroom and our word wall houses high frequency words and rich tier 2 vocabulary words but on the morning of the fair the little calf was nowhere to be found she had wandered down to mud pond by the cornfield to cool off when she waded into the muddy water her feet sank with every step she sank deeper and deeper and deeper the little calf was stuck in mud pond get the hands get the helpers the farmer shouted when he saw her all the farm hands came running with their ropes but the more they tugged the more stuck the calf got get the big yellow tractor the farmer shouted he can save her but the big tractor just scared the little calf she sank deeper and deeper and nearby farmers began to gather around readers i think we ve come to our problem in the story i think the characters otis and the calf have a big problem talk to your partner and see if you can figure out what the problem is readers i heard a lot of good ideas i heard a lot of good discussion miami what s the problem who sank into the mud the baby cow it s called a calf oh my goodness readers i heard everybody s discussions you guys were all talking about the big problem the calf is stuck in the mud help me write that in the problem box here we go the calf is stuck in the mud that s our problem the calf is stuck in the mud let s see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story let s see how they re feeling now it tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions call fire chief douglas and the fire truck the farmer shouted they can save our little calf but the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper the farmer was fit to be tied if the farm hands and the big tractor and even fire chief douglas and his fire truck couldn t save the little calf who could oh my goodness look at everybody what effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community how is everybody feeling i like amir s raised hand how is everybody feeling amir they feel sad sad i heard you say another good word that started with w worried worried they re sad they re worried how else are they feeling sad worried scared scared scary what if they can t get her out scary call a lot of people yeah they re in panic mode they re trying to call everyone they re panicked frightened afraid afraid worried worried so so worried so so worried they might call the other tractor the big tractor can t get her out he already tried wait kanye were you talking about the other tractor the red one oh they might call otis maybe otis could help that might be a good solution to the problem let s see what they do let s find out suddenly the little calf s ears perked up over the hum of the growling crowd there came a faint sound in the distance a soft rhythmic purr put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck the crowd turned and looked you hear the word chuck who is coming otis otis good let s see what happens the sound became louder put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck let s all make otis sound put put puttity chuck put put put chuck put put puttity chuck all at once otis put puffed from around the barn he turned and he headed straight for mud pond otis put puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters edge the calf heard her friend s puttering purr and bawled it was almost like hello she s crying out to otis yeah she bawled to the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd otis slowly began to circle the pond he circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned never taking her eye off her friend it looks like they might be solving their problem with each ring otis made around mud pond the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own the two friends had found each other again it looks like we found a solution to our problem talk to your partner about how they found a solution how did they solve their problem i heard a lot of good discussion how did they solve their problem you guys i heard everybody talking about it so jabrielle how did they solve their problem what was the solution who came and got her out of the mud i heard you tell isaiah otis otis ramaya how did otis get her out of the mud just like jabrielle said he rided around the mud oh i don t know if you can hear ramaya she said otis rode around mud pond and got the calf out of the mud help me write that otis rode around mud pond it was called mud pond otis rode around mud pond and he got the calf out of the mud that s the solution now how is everybody feeling what effect is this having how do they feel now that they have their problem solved nijyah excited excited miami happy sherod glad glad edward yeah they re feeling great they re reunited their family is back together zion how do you feel when you solve your problem they are a little exhausted aren t they that was a lot of work ismail they re feeling okay they re feeling relieved relieved wow great job let s see how the story ends readers you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story it s really helping us comprehend the story better we re understanding it really well otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went following them into town it looked like a happy parade no one needed a fancy no one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf otis was a special tractor and the two of them were special friends from that day on the farmer discovered that with otis puttering purr beside the chicken coop his chickens laid more eggs at milking time with otis gentle chuck nearby his cow produced more milk and on occasion otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields but often at the end of the day otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved,0.0
clipart okay you show me well if we wanted to insert a clipart picture where do you think would be the best place to go click on insert and then where is clipart here you go and i bet you we re going to find some really cool spider pictures click on spi type in spiders and see what you come up with hold on i ll be right over yes wow look at all those spiders you have tons oh your project s gonna be neat cause you have all kinds of neat pictures um i think something in our computer is off okay let s turn this off these computers sometimes get a little fussy and it s making bad choices when i get em i just keep pressing enter well it s sort of like hitting an elevator button but you can t really make it go any faster but you feel a little better about click click click click click so go ahead and look over here hopefully that will come up a little faster sometimes it just is a little slow start with there you go you know what to do okay there s a big picture that s a huge picture that s a neat spider i think that ll be a neat one for your for your project yeah okay um well when we when we clicked on the uh and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before yeah we did want to do that we did and we clicked no okay so that s probably why okay so let s go onto clipart office online and you re going to be able to find some really neat pictures here too this is the same thing type in squirrel let s see what we find make sure you spell it correctly q u i r r e it s a hard word i r r e and then the color can i put s doesn t matter hit scroll or anything okay and see what you can find look at all those squirrels you should pick that one a moving one yeah okay so you copy it to your clipboard now here s the problem you need to accept the service agreement and you ll have to do it again yes okay now click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard three times i i know did you copy it to the clipboard did you click on it okay then go back to powerpoint let s see if it works uh you know how to copy and paste things so go ahead and paste it in there yay he ll move but not right now when you go to make him a little bigger though i would say make him fat now you can check to see how he s doing if you wanna go to your slideshow and from the beginning and see if he ll move for you there he goes yay see now you know he worked yay good job we are entertaining using second person stories last time we were together we started a story here today called aliens in the library you saw that i put my name up here on the line and it says aliens in the library the introduction page is the part where i underlined those you s did you notice how these you s are underlined over and over again the reason is because we don t typically write like this this is kind of unfamiliar for us we had fun making the beginning of this story we only wrote half of the story using this graphic organizer do we remember why we only wrote half of the story why did we only write this side of the story because that was like the one story right there are two main things that you can choose from if you look up here at the board everybody should be looking up here you can see that there are two choices for each one you have your introduction and you have your two choices we only did this half of the story so right now we re going to hide the other half because we re not even thinking about it yet so the story was that you re in the library you hear a noise like what did we say rats in a blender and so you go out to investigate what the story was now that s the coolest part about this project guys the reason we are making our own stories rather than me grabbing the book from a shelf and copying it on here is because we want to use information in our own way what s that called when you take someone else s information and put it on a piece of paper what s that called who can remember what that s called what s that called copyright infringement copyright infringement or there s another big p word too that we talked about that s a tough one do you remember what that one is plagiarism plagiarism and if you take a story of someone else s and stick it on there it s a problem and so when you have a story in your mind you want to make sure that it is your story and your story alone the best way for me to describe this is right now for reading team we designed our own t shirts for a t shirt contest maybe your t shirt isn t the winning entry and the team doesn t make your shirt on their shirt but you go to the competition and another team from another school district has your shirt design on the front of it how would you feel about that how would you feel if someone took your idea and walked around with your shirt on your idea that you came up with your in your own brain how would that make you feel kind of angry it would make me feel angry how about you sad sad is another really good word for it i would be furious if we used our exciting words for our writing but i would also be really disappointed maybe kind of flattered that someone liked my idea so much they put it on their own shirt but it s the same thing is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle yes you think it s wrong why is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle because that was just like stealing you steal without even asking right and that would hurt someone s feelings and it s illegal is it wrong to steal someone s pencil is it wrong to steal someone s pencil is it wrong to steal someone s pencil why is wrong to steal someone s pencil because it s their property because it s their property and it s not yours so stealing someone s ideas is the same idea so when you go to write your stories boys and girls and the reason we re writing our own stories is because we re making this our own we re making this our own design and i think that s really important for us to remember because the more that you use your own ideas the better it is for you you have all these ideas in your heads and i know you all have wonderful creativity so we re writing our own stories we re not taking the story of a tv show you saw last night like spongebob and you re not making a spongebob story i want this to be your own idea so we have aliens in the library and we have our half here you re a librarian you hear a strange noise it sounds like screeching rats in a blender what should you do we decided our two choices were open the door or hide under your desk if you open the door you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway i think we had a majority of people here i don t know if everyone here likes the cutest little alien idea but this is our story and we re sticking with it it has a big pink bow in her hair antennae and a pink polka dot dress what do you do you could either invite her in or slam the door in fright you invite her in she surprisingly speaks your language she explains that her name is lott and she became stranded when her spacecraft crashed she asks if she can come home with you what do you do you have two choices here you can either take her home or find another place for her to stay lott is a great house guest she even helps with the dishes you re glad you decided to take a chance on making a new intergalactic friend you guys have seen this before we made this story and i m not going to go over this story again and again but i wanted to review with you what we talked about because over here i m going to show you what the final product is going to look like this is what the story is going to be made we did powerpoint together you re familiar with powerpoint we ve done dozens of powerpoints by now at least and so on our screen here i m going to open up my document that i made while you were gone and it is what the powerpoint is going to look like when you re finished it is a choose your own adventure powerpoint and this is showing that you ve mastered the skill of being able to use powerpoint you need to show me that you understand how to use this this is kind of like our i would say our final exam for powerpoint so we know we can move onto the next thing or the next project the next exciting idea that we re going to do so while this is loading you re going to see that there are hyperlinks and we re going to work on those as well which will take you to different parts of your document so up here we have aliens in the library by mrs albright i chose pictures that are graphics from powerpoint or from clipart the reason i did that is because we own those i did not take them from the internet and drag them here what happens if you take them from the internet and drag them here they re someone else s ideas remember they re someone else s pictures yes you have to put the date and you have the put the website we have to what do we call it cite those but we re not even going to do the citation because this is more about the writing of the project so we re going to do that instead my aliens in the library i m going to show you the start of this and then you re going to go start writing your own story so here s my aliens in the library story now the best one from this class the one that we find or two that we like the best we re going to put on my website so the younger students can access these from home which i think is a really great idea these are not going to be graphic or bloody you can have some things happen but you can t have guts falling out and eyeballs popping out of heads okay because this is for a young you have to remember your audience this is for first and second graders to use in the library when they come so we are not going to make a big bloody messy gory story okay we re going to make cute little alien stories apparently this is what we made last time together all right you are a librarian you stay late one night working on your computer and you hear strange noises coming from the hallway it sounds like rats in a blender what should you do we chose to do open the door so when i click on the button that says open the door it should take me to that page ta da you open a door and you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway she has a big pink bow in her hair and antennae and a purple polka dot dress what do you do next we re going to invite her in if we invite her in she actually speaks your language she explains that her name is lott and she became stranded on earth when her spaceship crashed she asks if she can come home with you what do you do i want to see what you guys pick for this one who wants to pick one who wants to pick a direction what are we going to do take her home or find her another place to stay find her another place find her another place let s see what we decided for that part of the story you hear her shuffle down the hallway you may have missed the chance of a lifetime to meet an alien but at least you are safe the end now notice my ends always go back to the beginning so this is powerpoint that you re familiar with used in a different way are there any questions about what we did here yes how do you get the green buttons that s what we re going to talk about and that s a new part of the skill that we re working on but right now we re going to just be making these i m handing out these you re going to be in your groups and we re going to start writing our stories after you re checked and over there you ll make your powerpoints and i ll help you with your hyperlinks individually in your tables does it i m sorry she s talking does it have to be aliens in the library no no no no no that s a great question it can be anything you want any kind of story that you re interested in as long as it is not bloody or gory bloody or gory or violent violent or what s the other thing that we just talked about inappropriate inappropriate or guts you guys are really stuck on the guts copyright copyrighted by somebody else i wanted to show you a couple other ones that you can choose when you come for book exchange one of them looks like this this is actually a non fiction choose your own adventure about george washington crossing the delaware and it s about you changing history which i think is a really neat idea if you re not much of a reader but you still wanted to read some books this one is very similar to actually what we re making here in powerpoint it has graphics it s called a graphic novel and there are different pieces that look almost like comic books i have several of these also i have the newer versions of the old ones that i showed you and read out loud the ones from 1986 remember i told you how i liked them when i was a kid a few years ago this one just has new covers on it so if you re looking for those and then this last one this is a brand new series that i m hoping to get more on it s called the golden path and it s the same idea just different characters and a different set of authors that made those so if you re looking for a choose your own adventure story and you go to type it in the library catalog you can type in choose your own adventure the problem with that is you need to know how to spell adventure a d v e n t u r e that s exactly right thanks i wasn t even expecting that the other thing to remember when we re keeping in mind i m going to be coming around to help you with your powerpoints remember we have to use that rubric that rubric show me that you know what i m talking about which rubric am i talking about show me show me your papers yes this is the one that you need to do also you can put that down this other one that i want you to remember the other thing to keep in mind is we color coded these and we numbered them the slides need to go in the order that you need it to be this is a review of powerpoint so this shouldn t be anything new that you haven t seen before this is kind of our graduation project for powerpoint so that we can move on to the next project next time so we re working with powerpoint who remembers how to insert a text box what were the directions we went over this before and we went over it a couple different times how do we insert a text box you go to insert you go over under the text box click on it and then you ll drag it and there it is there it is and how do you make it change color does anyone remember how we make it change color how do we make it change color we re on insert and text box and make sure you make one down here yep and then you can type in it and then you do what with it that s not wanting to cooperate is it that s okay let s work on this one together if you click on text box you make the text box and you start typing in it who remembers how we change the color of the text box that s what we re going to need to be able to do for our buttons and our hyperlinks that we talked about who remembers you double click on the box and it will show up right you double click on the box or sometimes even triple click until you get those three a s at the top then you can change your color i ll be around to help you are there any questions about this right now anyone have anything that they want to talk about before we get started every slide has to have a picture what happens if you do not have a picture that you like from clipart what do you do i want you i m encouraging you to use clipart because it s something that s already there and we don t have to worry about where the source came from but what do we do if you want to find a different picture somewhere else what do we do find your picture you can find your picture under google images then what do we do then you copy it and then you put it back and then we copy the source you have to have the source very good very very good okay if you would like to have a whole separate slide with sources you can do that and we ve done that before and the date and the date is very important i m glad that you remembered that okay so i ll be around to help you go ahead and get started back again on your project make sure the slides are in order do you want to format your designs you go under design you two can agree on a color scheme do you like that one that s good let s look back at your thing let me see which one was number two that was number three click on number two and it should be exactly boys look at how you did that you put the words at the top now i did check the word vial on yours and it s spelled wrong v i a l maybe my writing is hard to read and then you have the two text boxes here at the bottom if something gets stuck can i have you guys be the experts and go over and help them sure okay great thanks yes can you help us sure what s the problem we can get well this one we want to get rid of remember when you go to do the insert and you insert a new slide you want to make sure that the layout is the title only remember how we talked about that one so you want to insert the text box you show me what do we do right and then what do we do okay so you drag it what are you typing in there okay so you need how many text boxes then exactly all right so you go ahead and type in there so you can show me you know what to do with that can you click on it and then use typing upstairs okay now you want to how do we make sure you pull that up there you go are you okay with all the pink i don t care good make sure everyone s input is added though maybe he can help with the graphics everyone needs to be able to do something we have to make sure this is fair for everybody you re working the mouse you re working the keyboard and he s holding the paper let s maybe switch it up a little bit closer okay so everyone has a turn,0.0
work of art in front of the class using the smart board we have to continue working please we have to finish the whole thing today you should have enough time if y all aren t drawing on the artwork that much but y all been working hard and a little bit of playing but working pretty well after you get finished with the analysis go ahead and flip over and start on your interpretation what you think is going on or what the artist is trying to portray in the work of art all right so y all are on interpretation yeah what do y all think of the work of art kaitlin what do you think of the work of art well it makes us feel like calm it made me feel calm it made y all feel calm no it made me feel calm it made me feel calm okay now have any of y all been out west huh out west like colorado wyoming places like that yeah yeah well sometimes in the mountains they have places where the snow has melted and there are actually small lakes or ponds up inside the mountains so you could actually either be looking at a lake where you could drive up to or something that s hidden in the mountains so if you re calm that s a pretty good idea all right guys what are y all working on now we re on judging the building i keep working on one okay can you tell me what you have about interpretation i think of this art as a rainy day the sky is a dull gray i like the bright colors on the doors it s like a mixture of happiness and boredom since it looks like it s raining the dark clouds at the top of the painting when it goes from white to dark like from light and it s going to dark that s when you can tell it s about to rain okay gotcha gotcha sounds good that sir is my interpretation okay and with judgment what are y all think about the work of art right now my judgment of the art is that it s kind of a boring day it s slightly dull but you don t know what s about to happen sounds good so far keep working y all doing all right over here yeah we re doing i wrote my opinion now he s gonna write his opinion yeah and then brody will write his opinion sounds great all right y all on interpretation what y all had oh y all are each doing interpretation yes sir we were going to do that for judgment and interpretation sounds great and what are y all looking at now for interpretation with the subway painting we re doing what it makes you feel okay what do you have so far well he wrote most of them okay so he can read it okay actually it makes me feel like traveling okay since they re on a train and that s pretty much it all right who would like to tell me what they are thinking of for interpretation on valley flowers i don t know i mean it s a good painting but it s not really my favorite okay it s not very exciting so that would be for judgment you don t find it exciting okay kind of boring what do you think of the work of art i think it s a bit dull because there s not really any colors or anything like that and it s got the same colors where each right here is green and right here is orange and blues back there you know if i was using my imagination i would think of maybe the incredibles in where the mole men came up at the end and were taking over the earth so these could be tunnel boring machines start using the principles of design okay so you look at the packet for the principles of design with the principles of design you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art so instead of shapes you may be telling me what s something you see in your work of art you ve got gold is where you find it what s one thing you see in the work of art gold you see gold what else do you see the miner miner and what is the miner doing drilling drilling okay so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art so go ahead and start on the second part with analysis if you re ready to start on that alright are we doin alright here yeah we don t get how was the work created okay you may have actually answered that when you were up here if you look at the packet right here and the title of the work of art is the sky pond read the rest for me who it was who created it kauvar kauvar yeah close enough smith smith born cape ugh this is hard if you can t pronounce it just do the best you can giradeau missouri missouri 1893 died denver colorado 1977 oil on canvas uh what did you say oil on canvas is how it was created and it was about this size right here okay so that tells you how the work of art was created later on you re gonna look at why the work of art was created and what purpose it served yes what do i say how i know what we do it says if they draw it in three dimensional okay and they take some kind of colored pencil or painting and then sketch it like you do and then they go from dark to light yeah and then they make the texture from the sun is over here and there s a little bit of shade because this would be covering all this there would be a shade right here so it s over here it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree yeah and this side of the house roof and that side of the house and you ve got are these shapes back here or are those somethin else these are shapes okay are shapes flat or three dimensional three dimensional shape forms are three dimensional alright oh yeah yeah so those are forms so those are forms yeah but you were right about everything you were right about the sun you were right about the texture the shading everything that s really good so you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger and also oil on canvas continue working please alright so y all are on analysis now and what work of art do y all have y all have got subway alright so what are y all lookin at in the subway for analysis so far it s something asymmetrical balance it s asymmetrical balance yeah there are three types you ve got symmetrical balance when everything is exactly the same you ve got asymmetrical balance when it s weighted the same so there s the same amount of weight visually it s not exactly the same and then you ve got radial symmetry which is a project we did a little bit earlier okay good so is it saying that shapes especially right here these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat cause these are more 3 d than these these kind of have shadows and are free so we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the outside factors i guess yes mm hmm good keep going alright would this be water that is possibly water right there yes it is and what part are y all on y all are on the analysis right now okay and y all are lookin at the valley farms by rose dickinson okay cool so what do y all have so far for analysis colors from the scene go together it can show could you speak a little louder sorry colors from the scene go together it can show a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there a small fire is going on with smoke coming from the flames smoke is coming from the mountains sounds good keep going alright let s check in over here how are y all doin good okay wow y all have got a lot for an analysis alright what else do you have so y all are about ready to start on analysis yes sir okay so let s look here now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made are related to each other i e how the effects were organized complement one another or create harmony or distress this step can often be the most confusing because it is very similar to the first and can easily overlap a good suggestion is think about all the principles of art movement rhythm variety portion emphasis and balance and contrast work together okay so think about how they work together to create this work of art and tell me everything you see in the work of art but not by shape and colors alright the shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will what a texture what the the shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will like he is actually drilling near a cave creative now would you say these warm colors or cool colors warm warm way warm warm now why would you say they re warm colors cause they re darker they re darker okay it shows that the colors of the background yeah now something else does it look like he blends into the background no he doesn t yeah uh huh okay so think about that too if he stood out he would look like he maybe didn t belong but it kind of looks like he belongs there i like what you said keep working i ll be back in a minute to check on you alright guys turn around alright what are y all workin on now analysis analysis what do y all have for analysis so far patrick i didn t get that i got one for variety and balances okay so something is different from this picture can you just read to me what you have so far please something s different from this top picture because the floor is green beneath the room because it s different because i thought i thought the floor s just one color so that s why it s different okay that s good and it s also different from up here you could say that there s a contrast let s look for the definition of contrast in here do you all know what the definition of contrast is or what contrast is two things are very different from i was on balance i m on balance now okay so contrast is what one more time i m sorry two things that are very different and have a large contrast okay so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast yeah because they re bright colors and they give out perspective what about the two cs okay two c s so keep going alright what part are y all on now analysis and y all have got the subway okay so can you read to me what you have or tell me something that you haven t added but you were about to jaymen s adding that okay i wanna add it has radial balance because you can kinda see where the center print is and then you can kind of see all these people all these stuff okay now i have a question have y all seen that there s a commercial on a few months ago it s a radio commercial yeah the tv where she s sitting in the train and she s watching the tv someone s reading the newspaper and she s watching the tv and she steps out and it looks like they may have gotten the idea from that ad from this work of art cause there s lots of people on the train car they re reading newspapers and she steps into the future by actually reading her s on a samsung galaxy or something like that so that d be a good connection to popular culture okay hello i was just which one we were talkin about earlier okay sounds good what s up okay alright what ya on okay what added or what have y all gotten to since i was last over here we see the ocean behind the mountains green grass is covering the farmland and the lines on the mountains are curved not pointed the mountains are curved okay the houses are spread apart the sky is a light green blue sounds good and it sounds like y all are just about finished with analysis so are y all gonna be moving on to interpretation next okay yeah active listening right hand active listening left hand ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups but please remember that we are all doing different works of art studying them and we re also discussing them together so that everybody s able to work without yelling across can we take it down just a notch a little bit please keep it a little bit lower i m not telling you to whisper and i m not telling you to stop what you re doing cause your doing a great job just let us take it down a notch please keep working please alright how are y all doin over here we re doing really good okay what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art it said that for the first question well the first thing we said the artist douglass crockwell is using repetit well is repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting and right now we re writing how classes are organized and how it s saying what we introduced for description okay now with paper workers now let s look at the workers the workers do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art no they kind of look like they blend in so could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery mhmm okay so that s something you may wanna think about when you re working on analysis or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit can you go touch the keyboard to bring the smart board back on please alright what are y all workin on now i don t know you don t know okay you don t know what principles you ve covered or you don t know what aspect of the painting you re working on right now we re working on analysts and so far we ve covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other we covered what colors they have and how they can relate we re about to work on shapes shapes are in there so let s think about texture some yeah we are look at the definitions okay and let s look at i wouldn t look at space or balance variety and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion okay okay we are completely totally and absolutely confused of analysis i m not you re just analysis okay i m not i m completely finished she s going all haywire okay what s wrong with analysis here i don t know nothing nothing s wrong with the analysis nothing s wrong with analysis she s going haywire i do not understand what art is active listening right hand please active listening left hand table four please ladies and gentlemen when we stopped a moment ago because we had gotten too loud let s take it down to a whisper now that way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud so right now let s take it to a whisper for our discussions please alright with analysis what you re doing is you re looking at the principles of design don t worry about balance let s flip to the beginning now let s look at texture do you have a texture in here yeah and what kind of texture do you have well it s really bumpy but some of it is smoother like a snow okay so that s what you could talk about in the analysis also in the analysis with balance is it asymmetrical symmetrical or radial now symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides radial is when it s radiating out from a point like a rim or a pizza is it either one of those so i d look a little bit at asymmetrical balance and then variety i look at the definition and then determine what variety you see in here and after that go ahead and move over to interpretation okay that way if you re being frustrated you don t have to get bogged down and worry about it you can move to the next step you might find that easier okay keep going thanks alright so y all are on interpretation now yep okay what are y all about to do for interpretation can someone read me the interpretation part basically how does the painting make you feel what does it make you think of don t say you think a painting sucks artwork sucks that said that goes in the next step what do you think what do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer okay so let s bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you re working on the questions and think about telling me a story or what s going on now does this look like you re in a cafeteria no does it look like you re in a school oh yeah no it looks like a barber shop okay and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop he s shaving cutting someone s hair now what about over here these guys are probably waiting for their turn okay that s what you need to tell me in interpretation what all is going on or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story we re talking about the story that s created in the work of art alright what part are y all on interpretation yeah okay so it kind of makes me feel like it makes me feel sad it was when i think of it before and it really doesn t make me feel sad i m not really sure how it makes me feel but i kind of think that maybe he was trying to say it went from cause this is kind of simple okay and i keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason but i think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler and it kind of got more modern i like that i like that and also one thing that this makes me think of is earlier this year we studied the artist jacob lawrence and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train controlling that with only industry in the background with the big cog or wheel here it kind of looks like a train over here with industry in the background but i like what you re saying about the calmer times and the more difficult times and i think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation it doesn t look like a train though yeah alright how are y all doing y all doin alright hey what part are y all workin on now y all got valley farm yeah yeah interpretation okay what do y all have so far for interpretation this painting makes us feel bright but kind of boring the smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it we also wonder why is there a fire with nobody there okay sounds good ah can you put your stool back up on two legs one more time thanks alright what are y all on right now analysis and y all have moved on to interpretation mhmm sounds good active listening right hand active listening left hand right in here we have about seven minutes left this should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation and start on their judgment today after you get finished with your interpretation one thing i would like you to focus on is why you think the work of art was created think about the time period in which it was created and why the artists were creating works of art think about your work of art particularly and you ll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that so continue working on what you re working on we have about seven minutes next time you come in what we re gonna be doing is we re gonna be working on presenting so those groups that have enjoyed this will be able to look at the smithsonian packet find their information add that to what they ve been doing today and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about,0.0
i m not gonna have no peace with that if you feel something i don t know something like done bothered me that done made me like brought me down to the point where i was crying about it the first thing he say i ain t gonna tell nobody but i feel where you coming from he tell me it shouldn t get to that point where you mad over something that doesn t matter if it s good or not that seriously don t matter that s in the past the past ain t gonna do nothing the past can t hurt you okay alright that s what i d tell him so really this kind of conversation should ve been held with what kind of friend a pretty good friend a pretty good friend or maybe even your best friend nope not your best friend oh yes my best friend you already know who i m talking about he s my best friend now he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad i ask him man why you doing this i thought you was different from everybody else but not once have i actually went out there and played the cards while i m at home how i m not gonna tell nobody and then come two days later everybody and their momma walking up to him and asking him questions uh why you did this to her so let me ask you this so your saying you ve had conversations with your best friend before and then he s divulged information that you ve said to him no from time to time he might get mad and he ll say something then we have to have that one on one talk ok this was between me and you i don t want to hear this coming out nobody else s mouth cause then i know point blank that you done said something let me ask you this if you would have that conversation with someone is he truly your best friend is that a conversation that jay chime in any time if you got to keep reminding him that hey man if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else honestly are they really your best friend no like i said before that s another acquaintance because you can t trust him like that man he telling you he ain t gonna tell nobody but he going back on his word he going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat that s why i said it s about you johnny no between what you say i don t blame johnny if he s truly your best friend he won t tell nobody he won t tell anybody but then you got like it s a boundary between stuff you tell you can tell your best best friend something deep but it s a certain boundary between that which you wouldn t tell him certain stuff i tell my best friend almost everything but certain stuff he don t need to know right cause certain things we my business don t need to be his he have one of those days when he feeling down then i come over there blah blah blah don t say nothing to me then he flips out on me and he wanna tell something that s so deep to me that i m sitting there looking like did he really just say this cause your shocked you re in shock and you don t never expect well anybody wouldn t expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that s not meant to be told me i would never expect chris to say anything i tell him so far he has been a best friend he don t tell nothing i say i don t want to have to tell what he tells me because we got that best friend relationship cause a best friend should be loyal all the way to the end not when it s necessary or needed that s right not when it s necessary but at all times right yes ma am okay alright let me go to the next scenario you decide you would like to take in a movie but you choose not to go alone you finally reach someone by phone who is just as bored as you and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant you both enjoy yourselves so much you plan to do this again where is that person at on the grading scale i d say that s a group thing because they interested in the same thing that you re interested in group friend okay alright group friend group friend someone that you know through association now in this scenario it s just you and that person and it could be someone that you met through the group or it could be it s not necessarily your best friend you just started hanging out out of the blue you met them and when your friends not around y all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then i d say that s a pretty good friend pretty good friend i could say a pretty good friend cause i would hang out with a pretty good friend a pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y all enjoy yeah because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group kind of like we re together because once again you know that person through association of someone else but a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say okay you want to go out yeah you wanna go out let s go it s nothing between you guys if its a girl you understand that she just want to see the movie and i want to see the movie we laugh we joke we go out eat pizza together but it s nothing else there we ain t trying to be boyfriend girlfriend you can t try to make it more then what it is right then if it s just a friend one of your dudes that you hang out with y all like the same movie like i you know you can t call me cause we re not on the same level i m your teacher at all times even though you know i like the same type movies you like and we always discuss the same type of movie we re not going to go to the movies together cause you on the adult level we on the young people level right and we re different types of our friendship scale is different is not even up here it s right okay now someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum you were glad to hear it because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway so your parents tell you both that you can go and you can the exhibit is in a different city your parents tell you both that you can go and you can spend the night over out of town what kind of friend is that is that just an acquaintance that would probably be with like with my best friend i wouldn t go out of town with somebody that s not by best friend i ain t going to go out of town i got to go with somebody that i know is going to speak to me you know what i m saying mm hmm got to be somebody i can trust i don t have to many friends i can trust i don t know why but all my friends is just the reason why i don t get too close to them i can t exactly tell you why i just don t because i can t trust everybody okay alright because you ll never know who will be your best friend today and they might turn on you tomorrow so you ll never know okay so that s why this is a good piece to do because we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance who is someone we that we will just see on the hall hi how you doing bye got to figure out who is the acquaintance and then we got to figure out who is the group friend who is a good friend who is the best friend because there s somewhere there s a fine line like you guys said there s a fine line between all five of them but you got to know the line you got to know where the line is drawn you got to know the conversations to have with all of them because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend that you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall right right cause there like you just telling me your whole business but you don t really know my name or nothing about me that s something the stuff you telling me i wouldn t tell you i would tell it to my best friend but as far as what s going on in my house i ll probably let you know i got sisters and brothers the basic stuff but not oh my momma s strung out or doing this and that cause everybody s business is not your business your business is not are you that s right we always got to keep that in mind because so many times i ll get calls from parents and they ll say so and so just talking too much especially when people are getting into a lot of issues or getting into confusion at school or what have you and a lot of that comes from the fact that they don t know when to be quiet or they don t know what to say or how to say it or who to approach because if someone says to you stand up for a minute in the morning when you first come in and the first thing i say to you is what good morning good morning good morning vincent how you doing good morning ms jenson how was your weekend i went to my cousin house i got to spend time with my godmother and i went grocery shopping okay so that now you told me i didn t say what did you do oh i said how was your weekend it was good it was good and that s basics of that conversation it should not be oh guess what my momma my momma and her boyfriend was fighting and they threw the cat out the window and then the police came over because at that moment you have just did what stepped out of bounds you ve stepped out of bounds you ve divulged way too much too much you done opened the book before it could be read or you done read the book before it could be bought because really i didn t buy into all of that i didn t want all of that you just wanted to know your name and how was your weekend i just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend and then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper but you not asking for that you just asking for the simple that s right that s right jeremy i m going to ask you stand up for a minute jay cause you re a pretty secretive guy mmhm so normally we got to pull stuff out of you cause i said to you earlier i said your dad called and what was that about i was stuck on the river and he said i was stuck on the river my first thought was jeremy got a boat so i said you got a boat that s what i said right yeah i was over there at the wafflehouse over there by brian gates behind over there at the apartments i went to see someone and so he went to see someone but again sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation and when to divulge it and when to divulge it because even though he went to see someone he didn t give me no elaborate details yeah this honey she was because a lot of times you don t need that i don t need that you just wanted to know where i was at just wanted to know where you was at i want to make sure you was okay make sure that your dad got in touch with someone to be able to say jeremy s okay okay alright alright yeah you can have a seat that was a good conversation huh this was a good conversation this was a good conversation you thought this was a good lesson today was a good day it was a good day because some people don t know their boundaries of talking and telling it all some people just give up too much information some people around here got to even say what did to you and everything from here we re going actually the next thing we re going to discuss is conversations that s where we re going to go from here i wanted us to because the other day we kind of looked at friendship but i wanted to go a little deeper because i know i want us to realize that friendships they should be reciprocal not always and when i say reciprocal everybody understands what i m saying the same no should be the same like how i feel about you you should feel that same way about me i feel like you trustworthy but you feel like i m going to tell on you any chance i get right exactly but they re not always reciprocal but keep in mind that friendships are always changing because who you put down on your friendship scale on thursday it change it changed you gave me a whole different not a whole different set but you gave me some different people and you actually moved some people where you had yolanda as a good friend she became just a group friend four days later okay and you had valid reasons and keep in mind that things do change just because someone was a best friend last week don t mean they going to stay your best friend they re not nine times out of 10 i promise you guys when i was in high school i could there were three there was four of us and i considered them my very best friends now i don t know how deep they would ve had my back but i considered them my good friends we talked on the phone we shared secrets we shared stuff you know when we was sneaking and doing stuff we shared those things but today i really can t tell you where they re at now there was some friends that i met in college that we re still friends to this day they re friends that i ve had since i came into teaching that i don t know where those people are because i ve been teaching when you think of teaching for 18 years people have friends people have come and gone in the teaching profession but i haven t kept in touch with all of them because there has to be a there has to be something in common that s going to keep you friends it can t just be i see if i see them just at school and that s all we ever talk about is school and schoolwork and complain and fussing and about lesson plans and stuff then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates those are just acquaintances people that i pass in the hall we laugh we joke but we don t share any intimate conversation okay i m glad this was a good exercise for you guys and next time we re going to look into conversations the type of conversations you have with each one of those type people,0.0
we all know it s splash just put it next to it your turn okay let s see how are we doing how many animals do we have do you have a few we think mussel it can be in the middle it can be in the high tide and the low tide because it can move around and then it eats clams and clams would be in the high tide it can grab on to the wave it eats clams it says this eats clams i saw the of the mussels sort of in the mid high tide one day when you were out at the tides before yeah excellent so you re using some of your previous experience to help you good excellent okay i ll be right back it s a snail the shell protects its soft part as a hermit crab grows it moves into a new shell it may take an empty shell or steal one from another so it s like war i think that would be in the high yeah that s a high yeah i think the high tide i thought it would be in the mid or low but no well it could move down there what s your next one tuesday put this circle right on top of the clock same time same height wow that s pretty interesting isn t it good for you oh you re looking at your first one what s your first one yeah just line it right there on the clock that s eight yep like eight yeah excellent and margo you re getting your first measurement negative one oh awesome monday s negative one hello kazhu i will show you where you need to go it s negative something i don t know what negative it s right here look here did you find out they went that low yeah mine went to negative six wow i didn t put tuesday and then i m going to put a block under it you had one that went really low look at that awesome you set that up first pretty well didn t you look s like we got monday and tuesdays getting done wednesdays are being worked on perfect so much to hear what it is you guys are gonna discover from the charts let s do a worm whatever that says they have a veil of flaps on each side the worms usually stay buried in the sand if a wave comes it swims back down toward the sand and wiggles into it i m pretty sure that s low yeah no how about maybe high high tide high tide no but the waves crash there a lot actually splash there s more of the sand yeah i think it would be splash want to try splash on that one good and you guys thought that because what did it say it said it buries in the sand and if a wave crashes it has to wriggle back down okay so it stays in sand as much as it can how many does nate have oh two the whelk that s a scientific name that s a tough one isn t it ah it s hard it s hard it s okay you can skip it just say look for the whelk on rocky beaches on rocky beaches and on rocks sift or muddy gravel beaches the shell of the snail can reach about two inches in height it is a scavenger feeding on kin it also preys on injured animals such as limpets the snail has also so i thought the sentence said it also preys on injured animals such as limpets so preys on them what does that mean i think i know what do you think andrew it means catch them and eat them it catches them and eats them where do you think that would need to be if it s gonna eat limpets i think it would be in the high tide oh you ve got both of them so you also might want to talk to addy and find out what addy has and try to figure out where those guys are before you place your whelk no so addy what do you think what is one of yours let s find out what yours are right under each shell i think it s already in the high tide zone i thought it would be in the splash wait no high high high yeah high tide okay the limpet guys i thought it would be in the splash no remember you gotta like figure okay i ll let you two go i thought it would be splash because no i don t think that the thing should be underwater most of the time it says watch for whelks on rocky beaches and muddy or gravel beaches it could be in the middle true yeah mid okay mid no you have to say where the other food is i put it to high splash okay you go then you go guys look too much heart one that was lower than negative four and this is negative four what do we have margo did you finish your graph excellent how are you doing on yours joshua you finished i m on friday you re on friday so maybe you two should start setting up your circle pick your question margo joshua and this is your question and set up your circle right on there grab your graph and a chair and sit in your circle off to the side there i think it s either low or splash no not splash not splash otherwise there wouldn t be anything lower mid i d think low no no remember at the aquarium they were underwater completely no things sticking out only some of the spine yeah but the rest it was just boom there i am doing it i m doing the sand dollar for my report and it s high no remember at the aquarium also it was at the bottom of the tank remember no it was at mid i remember i checked and also anyways i m doing the sand dollar okay okay so margo do you have your question with you so everybody gets a chance to converse and talk about the answers to that question or maybe you might realize something or come to a realization about your information and all of you can contribute to the answer okay so go ahead were there any patterns you noticed doing your graph what are they i noticed that first it went to medium then it went lower and then it went higher and higher the third fourth and fifth time my pattern was that each time each level started getting higher and higher and higher and so it s really high mine would go to 12 to 12 then it would go to 11 and then it went down to 10 and then it went down to nine it went lower and lower and it was kinda like a mix monday and tuesday were the same and then it started going higher and higher and higher all the way what was unexpected i ll go first it went lower than the average on the chart it went lower and then it started going higher and higher i thought it was just gonna stay in the negative parts but it actually went up to the nine in mine i expected it to be some different levels but it kept going higher and higher and higher and then when it started to go even higher it just kind of stayed the same mine went higher and higher and higher and higher again okay who s next i am unless you want to go read your question what was your highest tide what was your lowest one my highest was tuesday and friday they were both negative one and friday and thursday they were both negatives everything was negative everything was negative on yours wow negative even one below the negatives you have five negative negative five yeah that s right because you re grabbing you don t realize you ll get a negative five that tide s really low very low tide level yeah margo has her hand up go ahead margo on the day that was highest was friday it went all the way up to nine and my lowest was monday and tuesday because they re both negative one oh and my lowest was thursday thursday and it was 9 thursday and it was nine yeah and maia what was your lowest tide my lowest was monday it was about at eight and then it starts going higher and my highest was at 12 so i m wondering now if we look at all of our charts all of our graphs who had the highest tide of everybody who had the highest so you had a 12 i had two twelves no she had 11 so it looks like maybe callen and maia have close to each having a 12 i have the lowest score i have the lowest i think joshua got the lowest with a negative five reading on his anybody else have a negative five no i have a negative one but no negative fives okay alright so whose question s next alright i ll be right back,0.0
at first we put only tap water in it and then we all of a sudden changed it so but there s still tap water in with the oily water so you think that s why the control got messed up because it had too much well that s not variables changed my only reason what s the other reason my other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was like the seeds were duds were your guys s the oil ones that one s not yours no ours is the one that s all grown oh why don t you go get your cup and show people so this is oil okay well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden it died it looks like kind of so like at first it was normal with that thing and then well i don t understand that chart yeah me neither because it looks like it looks like it didn t grow then it grew really really fast then it went down super what happened was it grew and then it over polluted and then it just died looks like that well like well like what i don t get is i see the other oil one it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones it just like suddenly grew all of a sudden all the oil is the same with the control which you have all of a sudden all of a sudden also these diagrams also in the control diagram that went back down to zero centimeters i don t know yeah this chart might have messed up because that means both these plants die and then the control regrew yeah it doesn t make any sense it doesn t it turned white and then it died and turned brown because on my chart it grew point it grew it grew 0 14 and then 0 14 again and then 0 04 so like alive dead alive and stuff when it grew the second time did it grow or did it subtract the second time i think it died and then the last time it just kept on growing but the first time it started growing it grew second time it grew one centimeter what did you put in to help it grow what did you put in it to help it grow oily water so did the oil or the manipulator control grow more the manipulative one grew more because it grew and then it died so why do you think it did that because like i what i thought is that it was too much oil on it and then oil gets on the leaf it like it helps the plant grow or something just killing other doesn t the plant feed off the leaves so the oil got spread on the leaves and then it s feeding the oil then it died look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant do you i think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because like acid is good for you and it s mixed with water so it s not too bad for the plant but i think it got way too much acid and acid actually eats things it kills it and that s why i think the plant is all dead because like you said nolan it did grow because acid is good for us but yet when we have too much it dies so that s why i think this plant is all shriveled over i agree with you because acid is part water and that s what rain is but there s a little bit of acid so water s good for you but acid it doesn t grow it s not good for you so well actually it is good for you but not a lot i think you re maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on maybe it got too much acid rain and then the acid rain overtook the water and died so it like decreased by a lot that s why i think it s just like the red bull because red bull is like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy see right there just like red bull it increases and then decreases what d you think misha well yeah i think like what you said nolan because the regular plant grew just fine and then that the experiment grew like good and better than the regular one but then it like the acid overtook the plant just like nolan said what else i noticed about my control plant it started big at first and then it decreased in size then it got bigger so it s going off and on in size so it actually did kind of better than this because at the end it did better than that one and the last opposite it like died after the second one it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks yeah but it was only to a point it was living because when i did my second observation it was still kind of full but it was broken on the side so it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water basically it died my actual skin and everything the plant grows faster but it also dies faster and i figured from like the oils on my hand why do you think it did that because the oil on your hand because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as like oils in a car but oil still has the same base but how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand i don t know instead of wearing gloves maybe it s just the stuff inside of the oils and everything but it grew faster and also died faster like the plant that we have now is dying faster but this one since it has water normally and everything it s healthy and stayed big the whole time but the other one is like that but it died if you have what you were saying earlier when you have oil on your hand and then it was you polluted it with oil don t you think you polluted that one too no well like it s my whole point is that it speeded up the process what speeded up the process like the oil when i plant a bean or something when i plant bulbs for tulips or something and i touch it with my hands instead of my gloves then it actually seems i may just be paranoid but it grows faster and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn t grow as fast i don t know the depth of that part or something i don t get what you re saying are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster no i think it s just the oils of your skin so what would the oils in your skin do for a plant like the oil for your plant here is it the same like the oil that we used like it didn t make them healthy but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger but the other one show me your data that suports that this yeah what s your data that supports that the these ones yeah the one the data that supported it was that oops is is it went with the control it already had grown and it was after a week and ours still hasn t grown and it was growing at 0 16 centimeters per day and then the next time it was growing 2 7 centimeters a day so what does that tell you that it was growing a lot faster but it wasn t necessarily growing as efficiently okay what do you mean by inefficient efficient what do you mean by efficient i mean like it grew faster but it wasn t necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast so was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn t healthy yeah because the leaves now they re all gross and blotchy and they re dying and they re crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these and they have a shine to them because of the oil what did the rate of growth confirm that at first it was kind of spiked for a little bit and then it started going back down and now it s dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants it grows in a steady period of time with that it grew really fast and now it s dying really fast so what conclusion did you get that oil still makes the plant grow but it s not necessarily healthy for it do you agree yeah because me and because my group my experiment when we did this it was growing super fast and now it s like dying and stuff and we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because on the grass a little bit and the number of leaves will only be like two and then it shrivels up and died and then the color would stay light green and kind of brown like how it is right now and then my data was according to my graph the acid rain plant grew more than i thought it grew 25 centimeters but it started to die because of it turns light brown and started to die the leaves increased from two all the way to six leaves by the end okay my question was what would the effect be if i changed the water to salt water and i put if i change the water to salt i predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant i predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant i predict the color will be white ish gray ish my manipulator variable is water to salt water according to my data i was correct because the height was the same and the number of leaves were the same the data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants the rate of the growth was zero on the salt water there was crust on it and it was restate that so that jessica gets it and see if jessica knows and then like we were saying olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt and then like you know how water it attracts a lot of light and so people get tan yeah faster and then so maybe the shine for the oil maybe it attracted more of the heat from the light and it burnt the leaves so like the glisten from it yeah maybe that s why it looks all burnt and because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it s a burnt reel piece of paper something like sands off in the reel of a video and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen that s what it kind of reminded me of because it has a brown wrinkle around it and then it s dark and then it s kind of brown and crisp so that s what it kind of reminded me of and that s what made me think of it yeah and then how i thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how olivia said that when you re in water it attracts more heat and light to you so maybe that s how so that s how i got the idea of maybe that s what happened so do you have anything to add jared no you jessica no okay okay so i think the reason why mine didn t grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water because when mr kelson sprayed it all of the salt right here you could feel it it s all stuck to the top so the water can t get down to the soil and all that so it can t grow at all,0.0
yeah the oil okay so we discussed that one so maddie is going to write down about the peanut butter what the observation was at the first observation it was 9 centimetres and it has grown in joshua s words it has grown good and you re gonna do that for all three of them okay um the peanut butter no we just did the peanut butter oh no i mean the banana it s it s it s grown like 4 inches taller its like 1 1 and a half inch taller its like one and half inches okay what is that look its like 9 and a half 10 and a half 9 10 and 12 that s 1 2 3 we re looking at the bananas yeah wait that s half an inch alright so did you get that were the cheetos recorded okay good alright so now we ve got let s look here josh go ahead and read number 9 compare and record the results from all three fat absorb absorption observations observations observations okay so we re going to look at all three here we ve got our data laid out here look at your cheetos um the first time cheetos was eight and a half inches the second time it was 10 and a half inches and the last time it was 12 12 centimeters so what does that mean joseph what do you see when you see those numbers going like that um its like growing because every time you check one its like a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on and it gets a little bit more big so basically the longer that the cheetos sat on the paper towel the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel right okay so um josh if you ll just go ahead and write that down about the cheetos and hailey what did you notice about the next food the apples um two times it stayed the same and one time it got a little bit smaller just got a little bit yeah okay it says two are the same and one is just a little bit different and that could have been just um where is our centimeters it could have been just human error where we just sort of measured a little bit off okay um cause if you look at this apple sample here there isn t really any coming out of the green circle is there so nothing was absorbed from the apple did you see that okay alright so if you ll add that to our list that we ve noticed we observed shemaire you look at those potato chips i m going to leave that one here tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips the potato chips talk real loud for me um ok the potato chips they like changed each time like the first time it was 5 the second time it was eight and a half and this time it was 7 and what are those that you are talking about what units of measure centimeters centimeters okay so we want to make sure we get centimeters written in on there okay uh huh alright so what does that tell you about potato chips um that its not like that fat it doesn t got that much grease in it cause pretty much it showed like it was lower and then it got a little bigger then it just got a little bigger okay so comparing the three here what do you notice pretty much that this one has more fat than these two it looks like with this observation just this one here in class today and later we re gonna do we ll look at the food labels of potato chips and cheetos but right now just on our observations it does look like the cheetos have more fat right now okay but when we start reading its gonna be potato chips oh that leads us in it s gonna be cheetos so go ahead so um let s look at number 10 read that for us josh what can you conclude from the observations and recorded data which snack has the most or least amount of fat so you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there put most and least fine okay i d say the apples have the least amount of fat and the potato chips have the least the apples have the least amount of fat then the potato chips second and the cheetos is last and why do you think that might be why do you think the banana has expanded the most because its i don t think its because of the fat in the bananas and getting in talk loud i don t think its because of fat with the bananas that s getting oil on the paper towel because bananas are pretty healthy and they don t really normally have fat in them yeah yeah okay so that s your background knowledge you are aware of that what were you gonna say it s like its not fat or oil its like its just water maybe water absorbed in it what prediction would you make if we were to let this sit over night to where like the water would have time to dry up what would you predict this paper towel would look like tomorrow let me go with tray it would be all wet and soggy so you think it would actually be more wet yeah okay emily what do you think well i would think that the way it is now that the paper towels are gonna end up like that and the bananas would get all and more disgusting and okay does anybody think that the banana might that the wet watery part might dry up maybe i think it would expand a little bit more and then start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too okay well alright we ll actually leave that one out and see and we ll check on it tomorrow and see what it s doing and we ll kind of answer our own question there okay okay wait we re not finished what do we say about the banana you have to talk louder though the banana i guess the banana like expands the wetness it expands a couple centimeters like a half a centimeter good use of centimeters i like how you re using the actual mathematical term there the centimeter is good okay while she is writing that i m going to let tray go ahead and read that next question well if you can see it maddie will you let him read that so we can kinda be thinking while your finishing up there um what can you conclude from the observ observation and recorded data what snack has the most most and least amount of fat well um as my opinion i would think that the banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge okay josh well i would think that the fudge has the least amount cause it has the least amount of absorbed like grease and fat but the banana has like all this oil water and all that like sinking into it okay maddie i think that the peanut butter has the most amount of fat because um like i said earlier the bananas are more healthy than the peanut butter and it s probably just water and this is like oils and salt and stuff making it more greasy and that s probably more fat absorbing into the paper and then the fudge hasn t had very much at all so i would say it has the least amount of fat i would agree with like most of y all because the banana and the peanut butter is like has like a lot of wetness in it and the fudge has like a little bit of wetness like a centimeter yeah about a centimeter but also the bananas could have the least amount of fat because they are healthier and that s probably just water compare the results to the original group hypothesis our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat talk loud our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat our group decided this after discussing cheetos versus potato chips deep fried and adding salt and cheetos are made out of cheese so cheese is made out of milk from cows which is healthy oh wow lots of thought went into that okay so read that question again how do we compare our original hypothesis to what we ve discovered now in our research we were wrong say that again we were wrong okay so according to our data what did you find why do you say we were wrong because like the cheetos they had like a bunch of fat grease and stuff talk louder and the potato chips they like barely have any they had some but it wasn t quite what you were thinking right what were you gonna say josh we re gonna come right back to you no yes joseph she thought it was the cheetos which we thought it was that and afterwards now since we found out that it was probably the cheese talk loud when it gets stuck on you fingers it s all wet and oily and everything okay no she s the one that said cheese was healthy okay well think about it some cheeses are healthy this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese added to the cheetos right go ahead josh what were you gonna say she said that maybe the salt from the potato chips could ve dried up the grease maybe okay hailey pretty much what josh said it s the same okay so you just agree with that so josh maybe you could all just write down some of what you all discussed about the change from what our prediction or our hypothesis was to what we found now okay and hailey if you want to go ahead and start some of our discussion questions okay based on our discoveries from today what snack has less fat joseph um apples claire definitely apples josh apples yeah apples when you go home today what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why joseph i d probably do the apples because it pretty much has no fat which we learned and i d probably want to eat no more cheetos since i found out how many fat was in them now never again never oh you wouldn t live would you very good hailey say that again i wouldn t eat cheetos very often you wouldn t eat cheetos as much but in limited quantities right okay very good shemaire which snack would you choose i d probably have to say apples too because they are healthy either way and i love granny smith apples they re my favorite oh good good healthy snack eater i m going to have to say now since we found out cheetos how much fat it has then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there we probably don t know how much fat is in there right well we re going to look at those food labels closer now that we ve investigated these and see which one really does have more fat the potato chips or the cheetos,0.0
okay so what s going on with this group you go ahead since you did it we made like a t chart oh fantastic graphic organizing love it we put the ones that we re going to delete over here and then keep over here now we re discussing why we deleted these or chose them was it pretty easy to choose the keepers it was yeah we agreed on most of them what about the delete have there been some discussions we had to think about the smart and the healthy and religious yeah okay good oh and stay in school they don t have to stay in school so there were some that you had to discuss a little more yeah tell me some of your thoughts which was the most difficult probably the religious and also smart tell me a little bit about the discussion you had with religion well first of all we thought that it wouldn t be but then we thought some people had different religions and other people my dad has a friend my dad has a friend that isn t a christian but he s still a really good person it s just like as you grow up being a christian that s just what you think but then as you think about it that s not how you re a good person okay so you stepped back from what you knew and you looked around were you able to come up with some examples like was it your uncle no it was just a friend a friend so were you able to come up with some examples of people that were not religious people yeah can you tell me some qualities on the list that they have even though they are not the christian my uncle he s not religious but he s a teacher so he s helping kids and stuff and he s really nice my neighbor she s really nice you can t even tell that she s not religious you always think she is she s kind and friendly she s respectful i don t know just really nice okay so when we first put up our list that was one of the qualities that were on lots of list boom boom boom then just religious so we had to step back from it to really stop and think about that or they could be not doing their best in school but they could be a really great friend or person very good there s more than one kind of smart yeah do you think that having good qualities and keeping yourself with those qualities is another kind of smart yes and you re right i know some mentally challenged friends people that are some of the most kind hearted people good discussion good going okay why did you do happy because whenever you re sad then you just have that gloomy feeling hanging over you all the time yeah and also if you re not happy all the time you don t have it all the time every minute you can t just be depressed all the time and then stay in school yeah why did we go into stay in school thank you lexi come on over here veronica okay ladies what is your question we re going two ways i kind of think that you need to be religious because if you go to church it helps you become a good person but then at the same time there s like people in the world that are really great people but they re un relgious they can t be religious like countries and they re still a good person even though they can t also we were thinking people that do go to church aren t always taking what they learn and using it in their lives so you have found some examples of religious that are not exhibiting other qualities and then people who are not religious who show a lot of these qualities yeah okay so that kind of goes both ways i think we should delete i don t know i can go both ways so you can see both sides yeah you don t have to be religious to be a good person okay so can you set aside what your own religious beliefs are that if you believe this way if you don t believe this way something bad will happen to you can you set that aside and just look at the person s qualities my sister has a friend that goes to college with her and she doesn t hang out with her that much but she doesn t believe in god and that s her religion but i guess that would be their religion so really everybody has a religion kind of but they can t express their religion or go to church and stuff like that okay so which one s our leader jordan you re our leader so do you want to take another vote and see where it stands okay you re changing in a way okay so where do you stand now those are all qualities that make up a good person but again we all had to make a decision on it but again other groups can have different opinions about that or different opinions on how to make a good person so we can think that you need to be religious but then another group can say you don t have to be religious right it s all about what this group decides i was also thinking about the ten commandments that it has a choice if you want to be religious that s also putting that in mind okay so are you leaning towards deleting or keeping we re just talking how about you grace i kind of think it s i don t know i think we should keep and then i think that we maybe should delete because you don t have to go to church to be a good person does anybody have a personal experience in their own family of somebody who s not religious that is a really great person well like they don t go to church or they re just not like okay that is a great statement that jordan made that will give us pause to think what does religious mean to each one of you so maybe that s another place to start what does that word mean and then that might help you decide whether to delete it or keep it because going to church doesn t necessarily make you religious you can just walk into the church and listen to your pastor s sermon it doesn t mean that you re a good person so discuss that for just a moment okay what does religious mean to you i think it means being saved and saying sorry for our sins and asking for forgiveness so that s like the main writing in my opinion of being religious i think that you take what you learn in a church s sermon and you use it in your world you know what i mean yes if it s a very touching sermon and it s what you believe you can take it back and you can use it to help you go through problems or whatever and then i think also religious is that you re willing to share with other people yeah you re not embarrassed you re not just holding back and keeping it to yourself no matter if people aren t religious and they ll come up to you and make fun of you here at school you re just willing to put it aside i used to go to a different school i don t remember now but he was a very very very good student and for some reason they did want to i don t know why i didn t figure it out the pastor got fired because it was just a job to him he did something very very inappropriate that a pastor could do with another person within church and he left because he was so embarrassed why would he have been embarrassed i would have felt bad not just embarrassed and he was married you know what i said about you have to be willing to share well there was this one pastor let me turn the camera on you hold on so there would kind of be a way of saying that it doesn t really work out so if both sides are okay all right regan let s hear again what you said about the deleting why would you thought you would delete it oh i m not the one who said delete oh okay i said delete it because i know people that are not atheist who are not yes ma am i will tell her thank you scarlet vicki is not here today thank you ladies for getting quiet when the intercom rang now discuss continue they re still christian but they re still just as good as any other person would be that s why i think we should delete it but i don t know okay maybe it s the way she put it because she said it changes you inside but being christian it does kind of change you inside okay so you have a person in your life that you consider to have some qualities that make them a really great person but they are not religious yeah they re not atheist but they re not christian okay do you have anybody in your life that s not religious that you find a lot of good qualities my grandpa he s not saved but he still believes i guess it just depends on how the person acts okay how about you do you have anybody in your life yeah named delaney she s an older person but she really really likes her house and stuff and would you consider her to have qualities that make a really great person yes but you would not consider her religious oh no but she is not really atheist but she doesn t believe in anything but she doesn t believe in being atheist so we re kind of on the fence on this one in that some people think it needs to be deleted and others think no it makes a difference do you know anybody who says that they are religious and they don t have qualities of a great person yes some people as soon as they get out of church they ll go out and do stuff that wouldn t be religious yeah it s kind of like they don t have a christian background they ll sit in the church room and they say i m a christian because i m here at church but really you go do this at other places so then i guess it all boils down to what do you believe or what do you think that religious means a lot of people would say oh i m religious but then like you said spend the rest of the week doing things yes but they re kind of being truthful if they say they re not religious and they re not really religious so it s kind of two things so truthful but they re not religious or maybe being a fake christian like sitting in church they ll watch a football game just waiting for church to end but maybe that s kind of worse than saying i m not a christian but also be a good person okay so you re the leader in this group why don t you poll each other again and see if they want to now delete other people okay so go ahead and ask okay so i put i m not sure yet we re still not sure that s fine that s fine if we re not sure yet we don t have to put it in one side or the other yet if we re not done discussing it this may be one that the group can t agree on i think it s a good thing to have but you don t have to have it to be a good person yeah i think we can just delete it it is good to have but people can be really good people and not be religious everybody agree with that if you re still thinking no i don t want to say that this is the safe place to say that nobody s going to kick you because even religious people can also be,0.0
more important cause their friend maser something died the day before and they stayed in the village for that long they didn t have to stay but they decided to stay they didn t have to do that but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important well and it may have been a choice for safety also if they stay with him if they run to another village they may be you know picked off trying to stick to the customs that they are so used to like back in normal life and stuff like that so trying to get back in that but the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life like their parents and stuff but saved their lives yeah okay emily and simon simon emily emily and spencer i mean simon that s her last name do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village and blaming him for missing i think anyone would get mad they need to get it out on someone what do you mean by being right to get mad do they have like a valid purpose a valid reason for getting mad i mean yeah they were probably just mad out of frustration if you would have went in with them before like earlier before the rebels attacked they wouldn t have been able to see their families so that s what their drive has been for the past couple months or however long they ve been running it s to get back to their families even if they would have died i mean that s what he was saying is that he was mad at him at dishmrael for holding him back because he could have seen his family he would have died but then later on when his mind cooled down he was like yeah well he saved my life cause i would have been killed it was probably like an in the moment thing i think in that kind of situation you always look for someone to blame cause there is no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them so we should hurry and go see them he thought they had time to go and see their family like let s stop and rest and stuff like that there s no way he could have known that was gonna happen so they can t really blame him but they need to blame someone yeah i d want to punch someone too i d be so mad if that happened to me i understand why they would blame him but looking back on it and how does his age impact that also well he s not he not really old enough to really think about it all he s thinking about is his family with maturity you think before you act but as a little kid you just act and don t know the consequences well and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all there s another aspect and he used to follow junior and everything he did but now that junior s gone he doesn t even have that right exactly okay keep going war is hell oh yeah you can sorry about that it s okay so want to go kaylee okay ask the question the question girda is a young woman at the time of the book and so was valentino and wutuzuwut how do they change through the course of the book due to the tragic events in their lives i think they re forced to grow up real fast because of all the pressures at the time i mean valentino doesn t know his age but let s say like 15 and 20 and when i haven t read the end of this book but she comes home to america and so does valentino and they just come over and even though they re like like a 40 year old so it s kinda weird coming back to america and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures yeah the whole event just kinda makes them you know kinda step it up a bit if something like this happens to you you don t easily forget it it becomes more of a part of you it kinda takes out who you really are inside yeah it shapes you yeah well and how did the stages in their life coincide that s a good question kaylee well first of all genocide i thought was basically kind of done the same so it was usually like they lost their families they re forced to go out on their own they re forced to make a life for themselves and both of them kind of think or know that their parents are dead and so they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them cause i think ile or i don t know how to say her name she kind of motivated girda to kind of stay in the camp with her and have maybe a friend there where with abek s family she wouldn t really have a friend she d just have like she d owe it to their family to do things for them and then with achek he had william k to help him just had a friend to make it through yeah so they both had a strong friend what kind of life did they both live before disaster struck they both had the perfect ideal family life you know they were happy they were all together it was you know like what would happen in a disney movie pretty much everything s kinda perfect and then something happens in the first both in the person that happens to meet their family ties are cut and their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them and kinda grow and become stronger yeah i think yeah no you go okay they were just i mean they were forced to grow up and they just lived like ryan said like the ideal life with their family or whatever but once their parents left they had to find a friend or someone to group with in order to well what were they replacing what were they replacing with william k and ile yeah they established a family without being blood related they just had to make it through by that it s cause if you don t have motivation then you re not going to get through things so even though they didn t know that their i mean they assumed their parents were dead but they didn t know for sure cause on page 80 of this i mean she said that she never saw her father again but just to know that their parents are alive and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive not knowing they both have that in common right assuming that they re dead but not really knowing for sure just to keep them motivated to survive so it s a good tactic so what is a really simple message that we can take from that from both of their stories what do you need in your life motivation you need family you need some kind of family unit to survive or friends everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to and they can depend on no matter what the situation is right and if you re going to friends a lot of time at least in like a high school or whatever you go to friends with questions instead of your family or whatever sometimes you ll get the wrong side of view on things and it will change your life drastically cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be determines how the rest of your life but also you got a different perspective cause your family doesn t necessarily know what s going on in your own high school yeah so it s good to get both but family is more important cause you can count on them more usually and they re older and wiser you need that kind of like wise person cause my mom knows more than i do or my friends yeah but you need those relationships as connections right right to keep motivated both of those stories show that really literally life and death situations those connections with other humans it is a human basic need that we have to make those connections or you cannot survive i think both of those stories that s a really good question in looking at the stages it also shows globally globally what can we say about families at the beginning of the story you were talking about it s like a disney movie right yeah so what can we say about families literally around the world they re all usually together nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where like how they re supposed to live and like what s good and bad you usually nurture your kids til they re about nineteen and then they go off to college i think that s just how it is everywhere it may not be that way in some places but you usually have schooling and then you go off and then you figure out for yourself once you ve got a base yeah they re usually pretty perfect or ideal until like a third party like nazis or the arabians come in and just wipe that out and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves and i guess their friends since they didn t have family and that family unit seems to lend to safety even if you re living in sudan or if you re living in poland the children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives right right and if nobody knows you what makes you if you die who would care that s what i would think like if nobody cared about me or nobody knew who i was that s what a lot of suicidal thoughts yeah i was just thinking i don t think that but i m just saying if i had nobody to be like i care about you you need to stay alive or like your parents there wouldn t be a reason to live yeah but like in those stories like they find symbolic fixtures or whatever i think in both yeah the moon they look at the moon and they see they just see the moon and it s like their kinda friend but they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere or wherever they are cause they don t know yeah their parents are looking at the same thing that they re seeing kinda yeah so it s kinda like right there keeping them together and what s funny is that s a main the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone yeah and he refers to that also i think cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth it s a connection i think somewhere yeah yeah totally it s kinda like the bright light in darkness you know the night it s a pictch black but the moon s shining you know kinda there no matter what good okay keep going and the german s are just coming in and everything s getting really bad and like going back to their past and showing it as such a nice place what she does is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison okay what was the question how does the author implement setting to contrast good and evil how is it affected okay purpose and we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker because it s happening in this nice place but she s forced to saying the dark side of things cause she s forced into her basement where it s all dark and you know there s mildew on the wall and it s flooded and it s just really gross down there and that s what s happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in and then her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days you know running with her friends and chasing butterflies and eating sweets and it s just really happy and bright and cheery and so there s a major contrast and as you go into the book does that darkness continue or is it broken by light how does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps there s go ahead but i have an answer ok at least up to the point where we ve read she s kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything arthur s letters stopped coming and that s kind of the climax from how far we ve gotten where the darkness is so now it s about finding the good things that are in that darkness right i think she has little flashes of good things and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her of a bright future but it is surrounded by darkness and in the camp did she talk about physically light and dark also like the dramas and she wrote plays and they had fun there the single light shining in the dark room do you have anything to add abbey can you think of times when she talked about light physically light in the camps i was trying to think and how does she portray it cause that is an interesting motif in the book the light and dark and it will continue to play a part which camp is she in at the middle part she s in the i can t pronounce it it s the first one where she s they re sewing they re weaving so they re at the looms right yeah they re at the looms did she pass through auschwitz or was that the one she was in jail i think she passed through volkenheim yeah does she ever get outside that would be a key at volkenheim outside of the camp itself just outside in the outside well here s a reference to outside she talks about how the night was starry and beautiful from heirgonk i could see the hill through a window slowly the full moon rose so that is like a light in the darkness literally because the stars the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky and just her finding that comfort in that also shows really extreme light and dark but her comfort comes at night in the darkness and she has one source of light so keep looking for those motifs of light and dark cause they play a part throughout have any of you gotten past the halfway point yeah yeah we ve gotten a little bit past in the march you know that becomes very important alright good good job alright you guys bell s gonna ring keep your questions for tomorrow,0.0
welcome to mrs dunford s first grade classroom here you see a word work center where students are working to build words all around the room student work is proudly displayed along with anchor charts to anchor student learning at computer center students are working on differentiated computer programs based on needs at listening center students listen to stories to build their fluency above them is our word wall which displays our sight words our center chart the students are working on the smart board to integrate technology into reading here we have students at read to someone where they are enjoying reading books to each other around the back of our room books are separated into book bins for genres and they have their book boxes at read to self area students read independently and

things about him you guys are doing great keep up the good work,0.0
that one hurts it says volume by use the formula to find the volume okay so i got 53 when i added up the numbers yeah i did too i took it and divided by three 17 6666 just do 17 6 no 17 point three sixes so we ll just just no hayden we have to find 17 666 cause all six of them put 17 6 i know but we are now let s just round it up one to 18 okay yeah so with average it s 18 okay so now we have to do based on our average how close were you to your guess so how close were we to our guesses so like i was close by seven i was close by nine we have 18 here how far was nine and 18 i don t know nine nine plus nine is 18 right oh yeah so write nine right here i was by five okay all right based on our average how many drops would it take to make one liter 18 000 what oh yeah you got us correct a few times multiply it by if we had it to drops times 1000 cause that s how many milliliters are in a liter we get 10 000 okay so now we do water disposal follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid so first we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter so we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this so giselle you wanna do that no okay that yeah pour it so this gets to 20 okay i ll pour it then oops whoa okay try not to put too much i ll pour it out let s try again it with a dropper no you re supposed to do it with a beaker i know but if we re really really close and we can t do it with a beaker then we re gonna have to do it with a dropper so we just do this okay we re at 20 i think that s 20 we re at 19 i got it okay just don t drop it too fast cause i okay okay so now we have to add the three marbles so we ll bring em on this side yeah you have one hayden has one and i have one no let alina have one you do alina poured the water so it s you amy and hayden okay okay so we have to like tilt it to roll down the cylinder i think i can do it yeah i know but it s the easiest way no not that much you don t wanna don t wanna pour some out sayonara sucker okay the water level now is 26 exactly all right so it went from 20 to 26 so the difference in volume is six and the volume of the three marbles is six right what do you think alina yeah how do you think i got six i don t know well subtracted 20 from 26 because it s 20 before the marbles and 26 after so the marbles must be okay kay how we doin over here pretty good all right i m gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume what have you learned about volume so far whenever you alina look at the board that i made for you okay whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder what s happening to the volume what happened what happened to the volume of the water it was at 20 and then 26 it got higher it went higher it went higher okay so we can say then that volume does what what did it do rise it rose okay volume rises okay so the volume rose good and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement did you get that far yet yep okay we got six because the water was at 20 before and then after we put the marbles in it was at 26 so it s six cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20 good okay if you can switch places with me i wanna be able to hear alina okay all right so i m gonna ask you another question when you were doing if you got six if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have we need to change that to a solid measurement okay this is the solid measurement cubes that we use to measure solids marbles are solids so alina can you can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes to centimeter cubes each one of those is a gram and if each one of these is a gram that s correct and if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed and all and in that case it must also be equal to one gram so that s why for this i wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams i could also figure out that these are our three marbles and we have six grams then each one of them is 15 grams okay but grams is that a unit of volume or is that a unit of mass mass mass good alina it s a unit of mass so what hayden said is correct one centimeter one milliliter is equal to one gram one milliliter of water is equal to one gram but what do we know about the cubic centimeters we need to put the units in this term so if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles then how can we change it to centimeters cubed how many milliliters is this is one centimeter cubed do you remember one it s a one to one ratio like eli told us in home room so six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed so and this is the unit of volume but you re also right the mass must be it will also be equal to one gram but we re talking about volume not mass so it s the weight it s the volume yeah it has to do with three times three times four but you have to explain why because so how do we know this but why do we do that you don t know the answer right now because it said that three cubic centimeters and a height of three cubic centimeters i don t know if that s really a three with a height of four yeah with a height of four so we have to do our work cause we built the work right there and like height from a and the height hold on so so summer three times three and then yeah times four i m up to three times three that s nine and then times four gives you three times when i did this it was four times three i know that is so three times 16 no three times three is nine times four is okay it s three times four okay it s nine times four why would that be 60 36 yeah so we did three times three we calculated nine times three so that gives you nine and then because there s a height of three you multiply by four which gives you 36 because it s a basic math problem and it gives you 36 okay so explain why you know that and then and then we go on to number two but wait for her to finish i am i m just gonna be a little change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try and it and explain of course not because we re gonna feel like i think is something s wrong well we can well i guess if no we can t cause you can take that one off the building height no we could tip this over this way and solve for why would you do that what we re done with problem one so now so i guess we could yeah but no but in we d still have we would still have the same volume all right so the next problem is can you change summer are you still i m fine i know but we already read it though she can read she needs to read it ryan so what say we couldn t because the numbers we ll have to do the oh wait no no we could no because like we won t we re doing the height and we turn it sideways yes we would it s true okay so so how are you guys doing for number two we wanted to we had it like this and we wanted to turn it sideways cause that would change the height around okay so let s talk about number two that s the one you re on i m completely knocked it over all right so the question is on number two can you change the length width can you change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try it and explain okay so first of all the first rectangular prism you built so this rectangular prism okay was one centimeter i mean three centimeters long we did three times three it was nine because it had a line so three times three is nine then times four times height of four i don t know okay so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one correct okay and then you just multiply its length times its width times its height and what did you get summer i got 36 36 and i m thinking that more than one thing can equal 36 like if we had okay so how many cubes did you use to get this two for 36 this 36 how many cubes were there in all in all that was 36 it was 36 you had to count out the cubes right so can you use the same but have like a different height but have a different length width and height well yeah the answer would be yes because more there are multiple pieces you could do six like well you do two three and six okay two times three equals six six times six equals 36 two times three times six would equal 36 right as long as the three would be height so six could be this okay summer what do you think they think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes could you still use 36 cubes build a rectangular prism and but get different numbers here you can why do you think so because it has to change it from then like the 36 would still be the same,0.0
anything else so what composter would you want i think we would want maybe like a three tray or four tray vermicomposter and i do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper maybe you guys have a different idea maybe i was thinking that maybe we can make one because i printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter so again that would save us a lot of money just to make it like this might cost 20 to get all these supplies and i know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this and this might cost 20 when a store bought one off the internet may cost 100 yes but the store bought one s are quality and a professional makes it so they know what they re doing i doesn t really matter i mean it has the same purpose it does the same thing i just matters on the worms the only thing that we really have to buy is the worms dylan and ben i got to admit i do agree with claire buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about i know it says what do we know about now where are you guys in your conversation we re deciding to do wood metal or plastic but he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust it could rust because of the moistness of the compost okay it s not metal we re not talking about metal so we might do plastic on what if we make it purchasing one no if we make our own but this one is award winning seventy dollars all right and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class this is buying a vermicomposter that would cost 70 and what did you say about yours this is about like 20 because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes and we need two of them and it says the cost is about five dollars each and that would save us a lot so we could get weebly pro tools and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags so what are your thoughts on helping the whole community i think we should build this because it s better and we would have more money left over and how would you spend the other money left over i would spend it on like stuff that we need for composting like for tools okay wait we have multiple conversations going here in this group so let s wait i would spend it on the tools weebly pro and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost and then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out and that way you could get more money and then we could get something else what s weebly pro it s like an extra you can search it up on google isn t it a website it s 26 compost and then you can have a many slides as you want videos and then we can sell our compost on the internet and that would help a lot so how is the weebly pro better than the weebly that we already have because you were the webmaster on the class website on the composting website and you want to what do you want us to do we can have buy the six month plan and then the guys for next year they figure it out and how would us buying the weebly pro help the community it would help us to sell it and to inform about compost okay any other comments or thought we could it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own okay inform who be more specific the viewers of the website all of our guests yeah there s a greater chance it s not gonna fail guys we re not playing the what if game i not saying but we have a chance that the cups might break because they re cups and they have an easier chance it has a bigger chance of not failing we have to take risks we have to plus you would have the pride of making your own if we make our own and we mess up then we re just wasting money what if what if what if what it i m not doing the what if cause remember last time when we built a if you make it there is a greater chance you will fail maybe instead of cups we use pvc pipes i mean they re that cheap and i mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups shhh too many people that s better quality i do agree with you adam but i also do agree with dylan and ben on two different subjects guys why don t we just make everything we can make the compost bin but if we make everything reusable bags why don t we buy the vermicomposter and then we make the bags the reusable bags are more like for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag and then the tools we might really need later on when we don t need the reusable bags we might need the tools or we said we might need to go buy this now and it might be too late already what s the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags jessica what s the major difference between the two in vermicomposting it keeps reproducing there s three products while the reusable bags when you sell them once and that s all you get from that bag and with the vermicomposter it keeps going it s very unlikely almost impossible that all the worms are going to die in one night plus why would you buy the bags if you can make them cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags like walmart and target bags and she melts them down and puts them into a bag why don t we buy the vermicomposter so it s a better quality and we make the bags they re easier it s very hard to find a perfect vermicomposter that s plastic and won t break most of them are terracotta and they ll shatter if somebody knocks it over it s also wood and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad how do you know we re going to do wood compost things on the internet are using either terracotta or wood terracotta shatters really easily okay so we need to do more research on this i found a four tray bin that s plastic for 89 99 but still why would we pay 100 when we can pay for quality a mere 20 i know but the materials we use aren t made for composting listen to carly for a second what carly because if we do what ben s mom s friend can do you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter do you think you could get your mom s friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does i think we should buy the vermicomposter first like buy it or make it and then buy the reusable bags so just like ben s mom s friend s bags but we should make them both because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools like a new aerator if we make the reusable bags we won t get to put our symbol on it which i think is part of the bag we re thinking about doing ovens cause it s like one two three four five six if we made it we wouldn t have a guarantee that it would work because we could screw up the way we make it or we could just mess it up in general but if we bought one it would be kind of guaranteed to work but sometimes we miss a part or a tool that we need to put it together how do you know that sometimes what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren t always there because when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools so we couldn t do one part of it and then it just all got all messed up it just threw us off so from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something we don t always get it this part is the leading thing right there it comes built all we have to do it put the plastic bars together and it will be kind of easy cause it just like goes yeah and you can work as a group to make it because it s like those styrofoams where you pull it together and you can just see where it s put together the sticks like the couplers on the sides so we have something to be proud of that we made everybody said that we wanted a see through one so we could actually see the dirt and this one s not see through so if we made our own could we get a clear tote cause the worms don t like light so you can lift to look and the worms don t like light so when you look at it lift it up look at it and then put it back down that s a good idea no one else has thought about that christian and how do you know that the worms don t like light because we looked it up on the internet and then one time i was in my house and i saw a worm out in the street and it was kind of like rattling rattling in the sun so then my sister kicked it in back in the grass so then it was much happier and i re research that okay but do we have to do vermicompost no we don t have to do it at all it s going to be our class we need to vote on what s going to be the best for the community what about reusable bags i think the reusable bags are and why how is the reusable bags different than what we re already doing if we sell the if the people next year sell them at the holiday boutique then if we sell compost then it would be the same customers and if we give the customer something different more people will come because they ll yeah and they need bags they could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy and for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag they could use the reusable bag i have an idea i think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler and then we should get the bags and we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea and then they could buy the bags and they could buy the compost and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it s not that hard so we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost yeah that s what i was thinking it s gonna cost extra and then make it just a bit more expensive cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost you know if you put your money in the bank they give you money this would basically give you money because you can make the compost yeah the interest yeah so we can get the money from this and then we can buy the bags for the high level tea but that has no holes for the worms the sun is coming right into but would it fit in our room so we need to get more information on this remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size yeah but normally they don t do false advertisement this is like in a this the bottom is like this size of a desk you could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in it s like a shower it s like the size of a shower yeah you guys need more information we need more information before you can make a decision on that a lot of information on this already but we won t make tea if this one would have really worked cause it s made you know the more it costs the better it works do you agree with his comment no yeah that s what cara said can anyone give an example i don t agree with that because when i was real little i bought some toy cars and they didn t work as well as i got some that were cheaper and the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones okay you guys continue discussing that,0.0
all right so i showed you all that video for three reasons number one i want you to see that volleyball is not a girl s sport here in the south a lot of people think of volleyball as a girl sport because we don t have a lot of male high school volleyball teams i don t know why we just don t that s a common misconception that volleyball is a girl s sport everybody in that video was a male everybody in that video was over 50 years of age that means volleyball is a lifetime activity raise your hand if you can take a guess at what a lifetime activity is yes ma am a lifetime activity is something you can do when you re older a lifetime activity is something you can do basically for the rest of your life would golf be a lifetime activity no golf yes golf would be a lifetime activity there s people 70 80 90 years old that are playing golf as a matter of fact playing golf is an accomplishment to be able to go out and shoot your age so i m if i m 70 and i go out and shoot a good golf is a lifetime activity how about bowling yes how about tackle football no no tackle football would not be a lifetime activity if i was to go to the ymca do you think i would be able to find a league to sign up for tackle football at my age no no can i go out to the ymca and find a volleyball league for somebody my age yeah yes so volleyball is what we consider a lifetime activity something you can do the rest of your life okay the third thing those guys were pretty good mmhmm and they were pretty athletic so by playing volleyball and staying active you re going to be more athletic than a lot of people that are your age so not only is volleyball a lifetime activity it s going to help you stay in shape help you stay active okay first thing we re going to do is the serve with the serve there are a few things we need to remember okay first thing i want us to remember with the serve is that the ball must stay at the waist when we hit it out of our hand we want it to stay at our waist if i hold the ball up here and i hit the ball is going to go up it s all about the angles okay if i hit the ball right here it s going to go up and out like i want it to go all right so then i want to hit it at my waist second thing that we re going to remember is that my opposite foot needs to be forward if i hit it with my right hand i want my left leg to be up front like this what other activities have we done that your opposite foot is forward yes catching throwing right with the overhand throw we step with our opposite foot what else yes ma am the underhand toss the underhand toss that is exactly right i think ms beldo taught y all the underhand toss step tick tock point which foot do we step with the opposite the opposite foot do you see a trend can you make a little connection there opposite foot forwards okay now the next things that i want you to remember kind of go hand in hand they are tick tock tick tock looks like this tick tock pretty easy right tick tock tick i want to pull it back back here tock our arm is coming forward now we are going to add a little something to the tock part all the tock when we do tock i want you standing like this and do tock when we do tock we are actually going to transfer our weight from our back foot going forward into the front foot what do you think that s going to do if we transfer that weight forward yes if we transfer our weight forward it s going to put more pressure it s going to put more pressure on the ball am i plugging it harder or softer harder harder it s going to produce more force right i m going to hit the ball harder if i do this than if i do this does that make sense because you re getting that momentum going forward it s just like in baseball if i m playing baseball and i m standing in the outfield am i going to throw it harder if i do this or if i do this the one with more force the second one right because my momentum is going forward does that make sense so my momentum is going forward just like in four square if i m playing four square and i want to hit the ball and i m trying to get somebody out in four square am i going to hit it harder if i do this or if i do this that the second one i get my force from the momentum going forward that s right and the last thing i want you to remember with the serve is the follow through follow the ball john will you stand up please if i want the ball to go to john my follow through should be towards john right if i want the ball going towards the flag my follow through the flag towards the flag if i want the ball going to the cougar my follow through the cougar going to the cougar but right now we re working on hitting it straight so my follow through goes to my target watch see me take everything out ball s at my waist my opposite foot is forward tick tock tock just like that okay we ll do it a little bit farther ready john opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick tock all right did you see everything that we had just talked about opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick transfer my weight into tock all right you re kind of hitting it like that i hit it good that s great tony you ready tony you ready tossin it up and hittin it and stop just a second put the ball on the ground ball on the ground a lot of people are doing a good job getting that opposite food forward but they re not transferring their weight to that foot they re getting that opposite foot forward and they re standing like this am i going to generate much force by doing this no think about baseball i could step with that opposite foot but if i step and then throw is that helping me generate any force no no i want to step into it same way in baseball when i throw a baseball i want to step and throw at the same time to get my momentum going forward we re generating force so instead of tony are you ready instead of this opposite foot forward and like that i want to generate more force so i m going to start with my weight back here and go into it you see the difference ball on the ground please yes so work on generating that force going forward okay continue go and stop just a second ball on the ground all right one more way that we re going to try to generate force is by following through after we hit the ball so instead of alex are you ready i m going to serve this to you instead of doing this kind of almost like you re punching the ball and stopping i m going to follow through to my target if alex is my target my arm should finish up here at my target watch do you see the difference in the force between punching it and following through to your target so that s another thing to work on remember if you are doing a good job with the ball that you ve got you can switch to another ball if you ve got one of these big yellow ones and you re doing perfect every time i would recommend switching to either this or one of the yellow and blue ones challenge yourself a little bit let s go ahead and switch stations so that if you were here one person walk up here and get a clipboard and paper so you can leave notes for your partner if you were over there come over here if you weren t over here just put your clipboard on the steps there and everybody stop put the ball on the ground just a second no balls in the air everybody stand up everybody stand up alright put everything on the ground everybody should have to free hands together let s work on tick transfer your weight through to your target ryan go in his place tick arm back transfer weight follow through to your target i still see some people doing this where s that ball going to go that way that way if i m aiming at the ball on the ground if i m aiming at the white poster my follow through is to the white poster everybody pick out a target tick step follow through go pick out a target tick step follow through go get that ball we ll get you another ball who can raise their hand and tell me the first thing we need to remember for the volleyball serve yes sir the first thing we talked about yes ma am the ball should be at your waist the ball s at your waist and what is that going to impact and what s it going to influence how far the ball goes it s going to influence how far the ball goes all right so if the ball is up here it s going to go where up up if i m down here the ball s going to go go out so i want to add my weight in order to get that angle so the ball will go over the net and drop what s the second thing to remember yes sir remember it s what we talked about with the underhand throw four square and the overhand throw our opposite foot is forward forward right our opposite foot is forward like this what s the third thing shift your weight i want to shift my weight we actually did tick tock when i talk about shifting my weight but shifting our weight is one of the most important things because that is how we produce,0.0
oh water or more i guess and what gets thrown into the pond the pebble is there a pebble oh that s so cute okay so wait what order these do these rings show up what order yeah like what s the procedure when this was like like this and then this one or then this one they start small and bigger and bigger so drop your pebble in the pond there you go and it gets bigger as it goes up okay and so now maybe talk through maybe talk through what is the given what s the constant rate of change where you re looking for it and how would that be seen visually so the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second per second the adt is two pi r br the first which one are you guys on number one okay good in order for you to find for qr may define the adt we need to find the adt of different orbs what the adt concentrating with them so it s like four for dr okay so what did you do with your sand show me what happened here okay air is gonna come into the clear hole and then right into you picked the sand problem tell me about your sand problem it s talking about sand quality to a how to apply it at a rate to be permanent okay and out of the following the diameter of the base in it is it s going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot that s the idea and the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from okay so our cone has been smooshed but you see how it s still kinda narrow a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone right and what s the unknown what are we looking for here we re trying to find the rate of the height of the pile oh you can do it we said that s possible okay so kathy you re able would that be dvdt dhdt drdt all these dts we can kinda run together just blow it up can we do ahdt sure ahdt because you re looking for a rate of change for the height now you re actually on the hardest problem this is the trickiest problem and you have correctly chosen the cards for these but here s what makes it tricky i want you to read through this slowly and let s figure out the unknown and if they give us what other rates they give us now you actually just told me what the unknown is right dhdt dhdt okay what other variables do we have on this card besides dhdt and the rate of change ar ardt ardt and dvdt okay now you read it again while y all are listening and see if you can pick out maybe do dvdt or drdt what was that for both at a sand and gravel plant sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of plus what information did you just get you can say it again if you need to sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute okay good that s dvdt cause it s the amount the volume changes and the label kinda gets screwy too right okay so now we re listening for drdt we hope we hear drdt because we need that also right the diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude so okay so it s giving us information about radius compared to altitude but it doesn t seem to be giving us drdt right which means we don t have drdt and the radius is two feet and the radius is two feet so what s the height again it s the height of dt so we need to find how fast the radius is changing so this right here is the decision nice the dvdt equals four pi r squared to the drdt so this is the hardest when you get to the math what we need to find is drdt when the radius equals two feet okay all right okay i guess the next one we can figure out right now how many cubes we got three three okay all the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second how fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter we have you doing the edges of a cube the radius of an aired balloon so the radius one 370 370 370 so d ds over dt is three right plug that we can just plug that in cause it s not a constant tell me a little bit about the problem you re on does it have three cubes in your problem like why does it have three cubes in the box we started with that this other one okay and it shows after a second it would be that big and then after another second it would be that big oh good okay so it s showing that it s the same cube and it s getting bigger it s like three stages in an environment very good very good correct interpretation yes and it also shows the volume of the now what does this question ask you for at the very end what are you gonna be trying to find how fast the volume changes when it enters from yes i have a question for you here s a think about it question cause you re finding dvdt when it is exactly one centimeter right that s what the question s asking do you think dvdt would be greater or smaller when it s past one centimeter do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster or will it slow down slow down slow down slow down my challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with try two centimeters and see if you were right yeah so go above and beyond the question was your conjecture right or were you like oh no we were backwards kay okay the base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball at a descending rate and it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part oh you look great d two so okay let s pour the sand again so what five so it s pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute talking about the change in output so what s constant its cubic feet per minute so that s the the sand being poured in it so that s the volume i don t know okay we have choices as to who can t i have four and zero to bring it down yeah i m just gonna bring it down problem number what problem one okay next problem are we agreed a ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house the base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second how fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall so then you definitely got the demonstration item perfect that s right that s exactly what s happening all right okay you guys are gonna get this one it s what s supposed to be a length and what made you pick that one it s the pythagorean theorem and then why would you wanna use the pythagorean theorem because it s a three sided it s equal to the right triangle yeah exactly uh huh all right okay now i ve got a question for ya is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning okay good good all right what would that mean about your derivative card what would you know for sure if you put 25 right there get a constant rate of one foot per second anything special for this derivative card dz over dt equals well if the original if your ladder is 25 right here where would the 25 originally be put in the z in the z okay i that would say that x squared plus y squared equals 25 now take the derivative of this with respect to time would it look exactly like this or a little bit different one we re at a constant rate right and so when you do your math you can go ahead and put that as zero and then just work with those good that s good so what s the the balloon s increasing yeah following the radius it s the what s the radius it s four feet the radius yeah you have to find what the radius is at four feet and find the radius when it s at four feet which one are you on p two when the radius is four feet at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area so you would define the area wait which are you on okay so you have three balloons right and you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what okay okay the rate of change so if you have one balloon and put one back into it and then that s when you have okay let s see what they look like so let s see if we can have different stages of our balloon here you look like you must be at the last stage cause that looks pretty big okay that must be the beginning that looks like the beginning too can one of em get middle stage i think you ve got the baby balloon though i think that s the biggest that guy s getting i didn t know they were different sizes yeah they are actually different sizes one more do it and you let some out maybe you got it oh perfect okay tell me about what s going on with this balloon what s goin on oh increase four cubic feet and they oh what are they i think i m thinking of the wrong one like it s not like it s not measuring each breath it s something no you are thinking right this is is this like what we had two days ago yeah a couple days ago like is what was constant a couple days ago in our activity air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of yes so like the volume the rate of change of volume is constant is that true on this or is that a different problem okay and so what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out the change of the radius how the radius is and what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets it ll stretch out that i m sorry it ll slow down yeah i think that s a good conjecture that would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got sounds good and it is because it was what the volume cause the volume yeah f four for that that ll go on the left f four and d six have you gotten to the balloon part yet let s talk about the other one okay one okay the other balloon problem was about surface area is that right have you done this one yet yes okay how many blow up the balloon and let s see what s happening in that balloon kevin what was happening on this balloon it s the rate of the the puddle b a formula problem okay so how is jesse gonna show us the surface area of dvdt okay so let s demo that causing ripples thank you nice demonstration what is constant on this problem the area and then yeah the radius,0.0
so can you record two on that it s harder to write two remember here you can use your number line if you need it to help you do you want me to turn it so there s the two can you try to write it i did it awesome that looks like a two so was this awesome all right or super bad super bad super bad why do you think it was super bad because it s not heavy because it s not heavy okay julia what s our second problem ow the styrofoam ball the styrofoam ball can you find the styrofoam ball yes that one we can first we re gonna make this one is bigger how does it feel though is it round it does we re gonna be answering questions over here julia can you let make his prediction which one did you pick that one you picked all right why did you pick all right because it s little how does it feel feel it no it s not heavy what do you think is there anything that you re wondering about that what s next what do you think all right again you think all right too mark them all right you think awesome you think it s gonna go 15 or more okay let s see are you ready can you pick up the tape and do it again gonna get the tape you re supposed to do it again because there s another space yep we re gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time okay put it this way ivan s gonna put it in is everyone ready oh wait you have to keep it upside down so it can push okay can you try it over ivan are you ready let s try one more time i m gonna put this cup right in front one more time well feel it is it heavy that s okay i m gonna be right back has anything surprised you so far what happened the orange ball so what kind of push was it an awesome an awesome push so did that surprise you you didn t think it was gonna go so far i though it was gonna go like is that where the tape went so you guys can pick up the tape should we do the green ball the green ball which ball so far a zero a zero and it didn t move at all yes why do you think it didn t move because it s so tiny it s so tiny but does it weigh a lot no no it didn t do you think that s why it didn t go far and it s so tiny and it doesn t have more mass ahh i see so should we do this again yeah the super bad is actually this one right here oh it s so tiny so feel it how does it feel let luka feel it how does it feel so jacob why don t you make your prediction from all right to super bad what do you think sofia what did you put why did you put all right so right there how far do you think it s gonna go what did you put sofia sofia picked luka what do you think which one do you think what s it gonna be awesome all right or super bad good pick all right so we re gonna do it down here on this one all right are you ready make your prediction and then we re gonna put it on the ground what do you think awesome all right or super bad who picked awesome sofia right do you guys have anything that you re remember when we were i do remember when we were trying to what did we find out what is it what do you think for the second ball you think a rock is inside maybe if they were rocks then they would be so hard that s true is it really hard a little a little bit hard what do you think is inside can we find out we can open one of these probably let s put it down first everybody write it jacob are you the recorder what are you the counselor are you the starter okay guys is everyone ready you know what we re gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup we can move the tape now sofia we need you to count move the cup over how far did it go one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 will you count again with me ready one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 jacob this went 10 can you write 10 down no for the super bad it went 10 yep it s super awesome so what do you think where did it go was it awesome all right or super bad awesome all right it was all right why was it all right and is 10 more or less than 15 less than 15 so that s why it s all right okay guys i m gonna go to the next group now what you re gonna do is trial two you re gonna do every ball one more time okay yep we re gonna do it one more time okay i will be right back how s it going over here has anything surprised you what surprised you which ball didn t push it very far wait how far did it actually push so that means that the cup didn t move at all why do you think the cup didn t move because it s so light which one moved the farthest so far which ball the orange one is the orange ball really light how does the orange one feel like it has more mass is there anything you guys are wondering about if they re bouncy let s put this ball back does that one bounce i wonder why not okay so what are we putting next on your sheet what should you do are you putting the rubber ball yeah are you guys all putting that you think it s gonna be an awesome push ready put tape here alexandra are you the taper it s on the wrong side no she got it she did it so move the cup over now nicholas is gonna count one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 can you help write in 13 yeah this one right here has a one and a three can you try writing that it s gonna have one more it s gonna have one more so if the styrofoam ball went zero and the orange ball went 13 which one is more 13 how do you know that you just know that when you count does it come higher yes it does okay ivan s ball is next we need to do a trial shoot of which one okay you have a red yeah mine what do you guys think about this ball it s awesome it s awesome why is it awesome it s awesome because it s red and it s the cardinals color well i would love for you to come should we see how far it goes all right let s check it it knocked the cup over let s try one more time it knocked it over again we re gonna put the tape here do you think that was farther than the rubber ball but when the ball goes farther seven eight nine 10 11 what can you find it on the number line where s 11 uh huh that s what it looks like is 11 more or less than 13 is it more than 13 or less which one is what more than is more than 11 if you look on the number line so you re right 13 is more yeah yeah okay you guys can start putting the balls away,0.0
until i say switch so you stay at your center when you are finished when i say switch you may go to the next center okay all right so here are different centers you know where you go you may go to your center and you may begin let s go back again let s make sure we re pushing there you go 14 14 14 where should we start them good job nice job where do you think we should start our cubes when we re gonna measure here yeah because we wanna line it up where it starts good nathan used more force to do it right nathan used a little bit more force than you didn t he so when you used more force what did that do it made it go farther it made it go farther good job all right guys if you are done put your thumbs up if you are still working raise your hand in the air okay i m gonna give you about one more minute to finish up all right how did it go okay very nice where should we start it now if we re measuring where do we need to start the cube nice job all right i want you to stop what you re doing you need to pick up your clipboard and your pencil and you need to switch leave the cubes and the pucks at the station clipboards pencils and switch we have no puck over here here it is have an idea for you okay hold on a second let s go down the list i want you to come back put that away i saw teddy go like this and put his fingers here and go up why did you do that teddy where it was but when he marks the paper there he needs to really leave it there and then push the other ones up and i need someone else to come over here and measure now we knew it was 10 here what are we gonna count next what comes after 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 15 okay go ahead and record that how do we know when it s supposed to be a okay so whose turn is this one mine where do you need to start lining it up 50 15 50 50 so if we did 10 what comes after 10 11 12 13 14 14 right there nice job all right stop what you re doing i want you to go ahead pick up your clipboard and your pencils and you may switch let me do it can i ask a question sure what would you like to ask me all right okay that s a good question all right who s gonna go next in this group okay why don t you hold on one second can you move over a little bit get behind it and push it 11 12 13 14 15 yeah i did what do you notice about those two numbers oh it s two 19 s i think amber might get the 19 you think she might get 19 no she didn t do you wanna try pushing it again here start behind nice job all right guys go ahead and switch one more time take your pencil and your clipboard you can go first okay guys let s get our pencil so that we know exactly where it is right here okay so now go ahead and count so what did you come up with 13 13 good job let s turn the clipboard around so you can three backwards 35 whoa all right now whose turn is it damonte s turn go ahead damonte now where do we need to start counting right here can you give him some tips where do you think he should start counting right here okay and why the line that s where the tape begins right or you could even go like this and start it at the tape and then you use your pencil so where does the pencil stop right here okay so then count to there i ll hold it for you you count 10 ben what do you think can you help him seven so ben thought that he got seven yeah it s seven okay so we re gonna stop where the thing begins so we re gonna stop at the seven okay here you go good job okay i want you to stop what you re doing i want you to quickly come to the carpet with your pencil and your clipboard come to your circle spot i m gonna count down from five i want you to be on the carpet at zero five four three two one and zero i love how you guys get to the carpet so nice and quietly thank you give yourself a pat on the back for doing a really good job now i wanna know what you noticed about using the different surfaces what did you notice about the tile what did you notice about the wood what did you notice about the cloth and what did you notice about the carpet sophia i noticed that the cloth and the carpet was harder it was harder and so what do you think happened the puck slowed down the puck slowed down what made it slow down the bumps on the towel the bumps on the towel and when we watched that video that talked about the bumps do you remember what they called that what is it that causes those bumps nathaniel it pushes back it does it pushes it back what s that big word that we ve been talking about friction friction so do you think there was more friction on the towel not when i did it okay so monalisa share what you noticed when i pushed mine it went all the way down it went all the way down so which one had more friction when you were testing it which one slowed down or did not go as far which surface was slower do you remember the carpet the carpet so the carpet for you had the most friction okay so does anyone else wanna talk about their surface kayley the cloth when i pushed the puck it went kind of far but not really far because of all the bumps which surface had the least amount of friction daniel wood the wood give me a thumbs up if the wood was also the one with the least amount of friction good job,0.0
inner circle number two again this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we re going with this why did the accident happen the accident of may 10th 1996 why did it happen any questions yes the may 10th 1996 thank you for clarifying where everybody died well not everybody but a lot of people died why did it happen because okay so i think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren t prepared for for the climb they thought it was going to be they re just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn t expect the challenges that they were going to face i agree they probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park turns out that they weren t ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain you were talking about they weren t prepared and all that but they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn t normal and i was kind of taken aback by that because i was like if there s a guide who s going to be guiding me on a life threatening thing i would want them to be seasoned trainer you know exactly i would think the same thing that the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew i agree with all of you but during reading the article krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn t really anyone s fault because people were so not in their right minds they were tired and injuries and how thin the air was they couldn t breath very well so when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming they didn t expect it to be as bas as it was so nobody could really prevent it anything to add to that i agree and i think that they were just having so much fun that they weren t really paying attention i think that they would ve all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds i know you mentioned the clouds but why weren t they watching them why do you think they weren t watching them they didn t think that they were actually serious enough to actually i agree with matt that they were so they wanted to get to the top so much they weren t too worried about looking at the clouds oh okay we can make it back up and make it back down maybe before not expecting trouble along the way yeah i agree i think that they weren t really prepared they were too wrapped up in what was going on to think about the downfall and what was happening they re tired and probably weak they didn t have safe they weren t really all there to think about what are the consequences of this and what would happen like the guide if it were me i would have made sure they had this that you re gonna help me out more than not really being able to anything you wanna say krystin well i said that this quote at the top it says that ambition has a steep price and i think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren t too prepared and weren t qualified but i think that well and the author mentions this too that climbing this mountian is it s taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when you re putting your life on the line there s nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive it s just basically putting your life to chance and so that s what i really got out of it what do you think i agree i think that then not as many people would ve died they should just listen to what they re told and and not risk their lives to do something that i agree with that no but i think that what krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and i agree but i think it s understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely cool and i would definitely want to go up there soon as possible and not worry about the weather like go all in or don t go at all i agree with lost or injured i mean but i m like half way there go ahead and accomplish what i set out to do and i think that would ve caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we re doing i agree with what ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at mount everest i mean it says that they caught about safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life one thing i noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn t go back and check themselves and i didn t understand why they didn t go back and and like when the one guy says there s no oxygen here there s no full tanks why didn t they go back and check that themselves i mean i would trust that person but yet again if my life on the line i would be checking it does anyone else think the same way if my life were at risk i wouldn t be relying too much on other if my life were at risk i wouldn t be relying too much on other people i d be a little weary about something like that i don t so much disagree but i came up with something a little bit different i didn t really think that people relied on each other that much at all who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain in a way i would say that it was selfish mission but in another way i mean if it was my own life i would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and i think we saw that at least i saw that a lot happen throughout the story it s a choice between am i going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this does it matter or am i going to get down this mountain and survive some people were relying on others like at the end someone was trying to help was trying to help he tried to help her down she grabbed his arm and he tried to pull her down but she just let go and died i agree with erin too i mean i think that right now wouldn t be able to you would think about yourself more whenever you re out there and and you re with the same people for that long of a time and you re doing the same thing that you become sort of closer they would mean more to you then than they do right now you d be more willing to sacrifice something to survive to help them give them another chance to get out alive too that s definitely shown at the end of the article when he s talking about how he can t live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost and how he couldn t even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time i agree with erin i think there was a lot of at the end i think he was talking about the there was a lot of blame involved and why couldn t we prevent this and it brings me back to what you guys said i think they really wanted to help each other and i think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases i thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn t prevent someone s terrible death tyler what do you think about this like did he grieve or even just the fact that who they were relying on well what strikes me all right outer circle what d you notice what d you notice i noticed that people were and books and just kind of in inner circle and i felt that that really helped them to get the instructions okay blake what did you notice i just thought that it was more and more like erin really led the conversation and krystin really led the conversation and i think that those were like the two main ones but like levi and elliot and alex they all also communicated a lot but there wasn t just one person who was talking okay so there were definitely two leaders but there were other people that were contributing as they went along okay good anthony there were some well developed conversations well developed conversations what do you mean by that like erin would say something and someone would build on it then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic yeah did you notice what was the question they started with yeah we got a little off topic no you didn t what what was the question you started with what caused the disaster and then you went into something totally different but did you have good conversation about that absolutely you guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life okay i really like how i mean it wasn t like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing mount everest it was definitely very connected to what you were saying dorothy what d you notice i noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn t stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another right it kept bouncing from one thing to another you could see like steam coming out of your ears they were all impulsive blake i thought that also remember erin said you re relying on someone and krystin s like well i don t agree backed up erin and other people backed up krystin and there was people who didn t yeah is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you absolutely but you need to do it respectfully like krystin did krystin said i don t exactly agree with you erin then she proceeded to say why and levi was over here he was nodding his head and shaking yeah all right great i thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses they always had something someone would pass on to someone else they paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses you guys ever heard that before it wasn t a pregnant pause it wasn t a big spacey gap okay anthony pretty much everyone talked pretty much everyone talked yeah pretty much yeah did you notice that they built on to what other people were saying okay they agreed i still heard i agree a lot but then they told us why they agree with what they said all right anything else you guys noticed yes i think that we looked at our more because they had wider subject that they talked about eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details it wasn t the whole story it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that all right anything else,0.0
no i want you to swing the eighth notes okay we re going to swing the eighth notes so remember when you swing you just make the first note longer than the second note so go like this don t be stuck at the tip of your bells here we go one a two a three and go every single person here please make sure you re playing f natural try it again here we go one two and go okay now when you guys improvise you ve got to improvise off of this d dorian scale okay so watch this if i was soloing and i was you know playing along with the music and i played this all i did was play the d dorian scale going up and down that s all it was it sounded a little fancy didn t it it really wasn t did it sound difficult yes it really wasn t i just did this like really changing the rhythm that s basically all i did okay so it s really not that difficult i m gonna play some rhythms i want you guys to echo it please sit up thank you nice and tall i m gonna play one measure and you re going to repeat exactly what i play we re playing this one on open d only on open d great now i m going to do two measures okay two measures and you ve got to echo it back to me this is still open d here we go wait for it i ll tell you when to go excellent okay it goes like this i m going to change it and go there it is okay it s just four notes in the second measure so try it again and go do this for me and go try this i m playing d and f so the higher pitch that you hear is f natural so play this for me great fantastic i m only going to add one more note you want to play d f and g okay with the exception of basses so do an open g okay so d f and g are your three notes all right get in playing position okay so basically that s improvising i m giving you a lot of ideas for improvising okay and you will only use three notes when you improvise d f and g you don t have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes when you improvise there are certain rules to improvising you can t just play any note because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice okay so we don t want to play the wrong note so please make sure that you only play d f and g do you see that tune that s on whatever page that s on for you guys there should be a page that s got solos at the top and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune you ll pick the third one with the tune do you guys see it yeah okay make sure you re on the correct side i ll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds and then i m going to have you guys play it okay listen to my tempo are you guys following along okay play it for me here we go watch your rests one two and go much better now good now play it again one two and go good i want you to play it one more time i m going to play the piano with you though all right here we go great now i m going to solo for you guys and i want to show you how you can do this okay a couple things that i did in there all i did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note that s all i did it sounds really difficult didn t it yeah it was like whoa no i m just going i can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult you can do it too okay so we re going to go around the room each person is going to solo okay whatever musical idea you come up with remember your notes are d f and g you got it d f and g whatever rhythm you want to play within the rhythms i gave you so don t okay here we go here s how we re going to do it we re going to start with maybe two measures we re going to start with tessa and go around maybe after helen then we go with tallulah priscilla listen carefully after tallulah we re going to go around this way after jada we re going to start with sammy and we re going to end with zoey okay we re all going to start with two,0.0
what you just said they re going to go back together well i ve glued them down so they can t the green and the red charts are locked down in place they can t get back but i ve taken up the orange field wouldn t it generate a new field they re going to make a new field and that new field will be say it again oh like the earlier drawing we can actually say a little more than that in this vicinity here they ll be trying to pull each other back together so we re going to end up with a field that s exactly opposite what we did was they move around as long as it s still running they move apart until the field is basically nullified let s look at one more example do you have one more potato shape in there most people most people right so let s start for this last one let s look at this shape and say that i observe fields coming out like that write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction based on what you re seeing in there what can you say about what you see are those lines all supposed to be straight yeah to the best of my drawing ability they re horizontal parallel lines my drawing was perfect mr shields what they re going in two directions the orange yeah the orange one like a very large plate it could be just a potato in there and that s the thing in your hand this one yep okay let s take a look chris can i get you to shut the door to keep the noise down we ll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so it s nice to have the extra period here first thing before we talk about this new one i failed to address hannah s question and good insight earlier yes the orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they re going to bend and will be coming outward from the positive end so you re definitely going to see this sort of pattern i think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations anytime you ve got a conducting material anytime you ve got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with it s a conductor so it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field let s talk about this new one there s a couple of observations ian give me one observation and claire give me the second observation besides the fact that the lines are straight no that s a good one the lines are straight very important claire they re going in opposite directions exactly opposite directions okay hakim give me another one well the lines are coming out of it okay they re coming outward not inward good to indicate that the okay so that one we know from the very first piece here the net charge is positive the fact that they re horizontal they indicate like a plate or something yeah is it like two parallel plates two parallel plates so where would you draw them above and below there are two on top so like above and below like this four plates four plates let s make it 16 but if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just but what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle then it would push away on both sides two positive plates two plates sounds twice as good as one but i m not sure that it is four plates sounds even more appealing an infinite number of plates sounds fantastic i m hearing good ideas here i want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios so two positive plates okay two positive plates and i m looking at the vicinity in the middle here is that right and do i want my two positive plates to be on the sides negative plates well negative plates okay two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what bend okay we re getting a bending because if i draw it here but you still have to compare it d be like this kind of a picture it d still be bent greater than the distance okay so you ve got so based on that you ve got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape what about two infinitely long two infinitely long plates both negative what would the field look like forge the potato shape what would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long evenly charged negative plates wouldn t they go if i take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle what would it do what if i release it a little bit to the left side an infinitely long plate we derived this one before a single one remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane it s constant it s a constant exactly right brittany didn t even have to look at her notes on that one but you remember what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate yeah gravity on the earth here you know big flat earth i don t care how far above the ground i am it s the same number it doesn t change at all that s exactly right so an infinite plate the field is some number another identical infinite plate it nullifies it so in the same charge okay well that isn t going to work infinitely far infinitely far away from each other when brittney says it s a constant even if you go to infinity i guess it d still be a constant either that or you go to zero it would be two sets one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they re infinitely far away where two horizontal plates like this yeah because i don t think that s going to work either ben you re getting agitated back there and what are you saying we were just talking you re saying there s no way in the world they can be infinite is that what you re saying yeah you can t have an infinite plane anything because you re defining the shape so that s a good question when i ve got the shape here do we require that the thing that i m talking about fit inside of the shape no i m going to say no okay so does that change your answer okay i think we can and will look at situations where the surface and remember this is all leading up to that gaussian surface idea we mentioned on friday where the gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object like an infinite plane we need to be able to study those even though i can t fit it inside of a box so we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there an infinitely long positive plate right in the middle right in the middle is that what you said about seven minutes ago yeah i tried to ignore him because i didn t want you guys to get the answer too quick but i do want to acknowledge him yeah tell me if this makes sense and why somebody besides john and ian it doesn t make sense that i ve got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it s a positive plate would it have to be infinitely long much longer if i don t now i m not very good at drawing in 3d so is the potato lines are they diverging this way at all i can t tell they re uniform this way parallel lines this way so we know that it has to be infinite this way and not have divergence this way well i didn t draw any lines coming out of the do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging that s going to change the answer that you give if i draw another red line that s coming like this that s clearly diverging from this red line so i m going to assume that every line for this problem every line that i draw is parallel and then we ll get a new perpendicular with the plate yeah perpendicular to the board and then all positive coming out both sides very good alright i ve got one more drawing on there i want to hit and then we ll just say some fantastic summary words and then i ll give you guys a break the last one here instead of the three dimensional shape now all i ve got is a single sheet of paper and this sheet of paper i ve got i noticed i noticed parallel lines arrows coming straight out of that shape write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict based on what you observed here what and where if you want to what the source of the field lines is what can we learn from the electric field lines they re all coming out parallel in one direction yes parallel in one direction one direction they re parallel this way and they re parallel this way also so they re normal to the surface everywhere are they coming from the other side all i see is lines penetrating this way so i could actually draw them like this and that s fine do you know anything about the other side of the plate like is there anything there it s a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate oh okay yeah they re not diverging at all yeah uniform orthogonal all that good stuff into the paper so they re coming out of here they re going into here and coming out here oh okay to the differences that s a closed shape this is a two dimensional surface if i had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference right okay guys let s see what we ve got here i m going to ask paul first emily second and then we ll see if michael can go for the trifecta oh no no pressure you can be wrong it s alright paul what is based on your observations what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object on this sheet i think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through where they re just passing through yeah so then where do you think it s coming from what does that tell you about the source of the electric field i m not sure you have more to say no emily give it a try since it s positive on this side yup you can see that there might be a positive charge okay so if i had a positive charge on this side i would get electric field lines going like this that s correct okay or if you had a negative charge ah okay so you re answering two things which is pretty overachieving but i like it that you re saying that instead of a positive back here it could be a negative over here okay now there s something incomplete about what you re saying the positive here versus there could be a negative here that s a great insight that it could be one or the other but michael s going to help us out because you re a little incomplete on what you re telling us they have to be infinite infinite infinitely strong charge infinitely long whatever a plane a plane yeah a plane back here that s infinitely large distributive charge that s positive that s the only way to get a uniform field here can it work with what emily was saying about it could be a negative over here it could be an infinitely long thing here there s one more option does anybody it could be intro that this piece of paper here is neutral and you could just put a new positive charge but be careful any positive charge if i start off with the very first drawing and i look at what happens when i put a sheet here the field lines are like this they re diverging i m not having divergence here at all so it can t come from any old point source we are going to assume that this thing is neutral though okay that itself is not it s just capturing the story of what s going on hannah could there be both a positive and negative along the plate yeah you can have both you bet that seems like a little bit of overkill but as long as you re making your sheet infinite in size you might as well make two infinite s you have all your infinite that s right and two parallel plates two plates that are parallel to each other one positive one negative is a very common thing so common in fact that it s on my tie today oh yeah there it is see that hakim do you have a question okay so it s the positive plane that s standing or negative plane yeah the infinite plane the infinite plane i was about to say that that it would be infinite yeah i think michael was saying that it would probably be not the charge distribution the sigma how much charge per unit area will be some number but it would just keep on going on chris yeah you know that would be a lot reasonably speaking if something goes to infinity all of your homework is easy so there s no purpose for me doing that what is the answer infinity or zero it s got to be one infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge but it s distributed infinitely far away so that s okay now remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field and here s the thing in the first three or four examples or five i guess for some people if i take a closed surface i can learn a lot not everything necessarily but i can learn about what s inside of that infinitively is the first one positive yes yes the next one that i drew was negative absolutely this most recent closed surface it had to be a positive plate shoved in there this last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with to gauge what s happening i don t know everything we ve got a lot of ambiguity and this is why with gauss law we need to use this closed surface we need to look at it from all sides we need to be fully envelop in what s going on or else we might miss something we ll go back again the equation that i showed you last week we ll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes,0.0
today is wednesday yes i would clone myself good why why would you clone yourself because everybody deserves a second me so you would just and i would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on honestly what would some of the negatives to cloning something like that well it s another me but it s still good because you know i m me and i m good and bad do you know your clone is not going to be like set right you re gonna have to wait for it to grow up so i have to raise a little baby clone of me yes and it ll look just like me when i was a baby pretty much oh that s wrong oh my god there are so many possibilities alright so let s start off with i ll get it a baby raise your hand if you can remind us like what is cloning there s only one of you like taking the dna or like i don t know like whatever out of one person like trying to like duplicate it into another one okay great we re all well was there only like one type of cloning what were some of the different types well one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only and another one is let s see animal and livestock cloning anything else you want to add to that gady so what s one way they do the cloning so they take the dna from one animal what do they do do you remember what parts they used like what kind of cell they used nucleus they did take the nucleus and they used the eggs of the other animal okay it s kind of interesting you can take the egg from one animal and completely change its dna so now when that turns into a new organism it s an identical copy of the animal that it came from and if you take you can bring back endangered species too because remember that or whatever then they put in the cow yeah but they were like related in some kind of way so it wasn t like weird that s true it was probably a decendent do you guys remember that from the video they had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct in fact they couldn t actually do the tests on the animal remember they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn t even do the tests on them right how long did last does anyone remember three days yeah it was about three days right but it was the first time so when they couldn t open up that cow the cow died right i don t know that for sure but i m guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically they were oh no i was just wondering because there s a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb that s true that does happen i mean i don t care if the cow died honestly that s another hamburger for me but that goward that goward that s swole you can t get any other animal like that anybody else in here agree that it s okay to do that testing to save endangered species well yeah because if there s like a hundred million cows and one whatever that thing was called so we should probably try and get more of them yeah why not okay we should clone pandas let s hear somebody else though is there anybody else that has i said alligator try and bring it back that s true what happens when there s so many i mean how many of you have ever watched the movie jurassic park oh my god i ve seen all of them at least twice so that s a good question so if we can bring back something that looks like a cow fabulous what happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool but has bigger teeth well you see it breaks out of the cage like in jurassic park the lost world and it starts attacking all the great well yeah it kind of started eating people that was wrong fabulous but what could be some of the downfalls on that like any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct well hardly any of the you need to the dna might get messed up yeah but remember that when we re messing around with the dna yeah maybe there could be a mistake what happens then it could die it could die yes i would say one good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to that s probably what scientists are thinking wouldn t that be great if i could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does because a lot of things they tell you about you know dinosaurs is what they think they do well we think they eat this and we think this is how they lived wouldn t it be great if we could actually study those what if dinosaurs were never real well they found skeleton remains so they re pretty much sure they were around they also found because you can t just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive because it will mess up the chain of life anthony has a really good point because what s going to happen if we have dinosaurs we can t just stick them somewhere for them to roam around because they don t have anything they can naturally eat anymore and they don t have any natural predators anymore that s why you just bring back t rexes and velociraptors and what not then you just feed them cows you don t know if they necessarily eat cows though you don t know that well it s meat it is meat but that s also your food source well that s not going to be maybe eight or nine maybe 25 for a t rex you re underestimating the size of some of these animals but the same thing applies to actual animals instead of just dinosaurs what happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses and we re expanding our cities so we re moving into some areas where there are some animals and they start to die off because we are taking over their land so yeah we could make a hundred copies of these animals or whether it s plants or birds or certain insects but that is a good question where are they going to live if we just bring them back wildlife park so that is a good thing and again remember that you all add because if you put them somewhere that a park they won t necessarily survive so you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that so yeah the food chain interesting how everything s connected raise your hand if you d like to share one of your questions from yesterday we ll start with anthony okay so like say me and this lady get married we both can t have kids so they take my dna and they make a clone of me i m married to this person would that be only my child or would that be our child and if why maybe yeah but what if you re married well does it require two people that has your dna i m sorry i didn t hear you maybe it is maybe it s totally the environment who s to say maybe if you raise it and you re like this is our kid well because of that case then there can t be any more like if we depended on cloning there woudn t be any well there d be less drama in the world because we wouldn t be doing stuff the natural way and like people being knocked up in bars and stuff and random places and stuff and like not knowing their father in life you know but you know what i m saying right do you think it would be hard like what if people were 100 dependent on this there would be a lot less problems eventually if you keep cloning yourself and then your clone cloned itself and your clone clones itself you d have the same group of people you d have the best group ever yeah but how would you know because you wouldn t be here that s dumb that s what that is that s interesting we can t have just a bunch of the same people that d be one stupid that d be dumb man i don t know walking around seeing all the same people that s stupid you re not going be like like the matrix everything repeating other questions let s get one from a female this time we got the guys questions let s get a girl don t all shout out all at once mayra what s one of your questions i said like if they clone a sheep and it s like sick wouldn t it or let s say there s a regular sheep and they clone that wouldn t the clone be sick too what did she say not necessarily no because it s like you said it s two entire different bodies of life a lot of things can go wrong in one person so how could it just be the same thing two different unless it s like a problem with an organ that the one had and then well i want to say that like a disesased kid maybe what about remember you just did genetics right if it s in your dna what would happen if it was in your dna it probably would get it if it was something that it caught it probably wouldn t get it that s true so it depends i guess maybe what it is right so you have this sheep just cloned it and because it has something very serious with it and if it s genetic then yeah there s probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on i think they were showing remember when they were doing dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned i think they were talking about the sheep dolly and then they had some mice that they had cloned they had said that the animals they had cloned does anyone remember what any of the side effects what they ve noticed sometimes they can t breathe right what else sometimes they died really young so just because it s a clone maybe we haven t quite figured it out yet because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal if they re dying younger or having problems growing other questions hector what is one of your questions or if you don t have your questions ready or you feel like your questions were answered maybe you just have a comment you have none what do you think about cloning do you agree with it or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it um i agree with it like the pros i would agree with it like for food for what like cloning for more food oh like the chickens right cloning to make more chickens wouldn t it be great if i have a perfect chicken and i could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken i ve had all types of chickens they all taste the same that s true everything tastes like chicken but have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick well like a tiny little drumstick they still taste good true but what one gives you more food you got a point there okay so maybe right but still you could put them together in the case of kfc the reason why their chicken s so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big yes that s the way they approach that that s the best way to do that right there not really people get cancer from that so would this be a good solution so instead of making eating our cows and feeding pigs and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones to make them larger and grow faster would it better to just take the large big cows and just clone them or make chicken and make copies of it yes no does anyone see any maybe this sounds really great like we re going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat but is there any downside to that no honestly no i don t think so not for you great is there anybody else money money how they could cost more to but they could cost less and be more affordable which is what we want good money is a good issue right people won t have to think about money issues i don t think there d be a money issue if you were cloning chickens because you can always just get you know take a syringe and like but that s what he was saying that maybe it d be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff yeah mm hmm it would take longer what do you guys think about the cloning for body parts can i go back to the chickens for a second sure go for it wouldn t there be a lot less farmers so then there d be a lot less jobs because you know like the whole that is true like a lot of companies will go out of business because i don t know i feel like there s like a monopoly on it more private industries are going to go out of business and that s going to destroy livelihoods because all the big livestock companies like kfc and mcdonald s well they re not a livestock company they re fast food but they re going to be selling it to those right they re going to let it go off of just by show of hands who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with that s just because you guys are okay with dying chris not sure or does it just kind of i don t care really what was the question oh i said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food no before that the one before anthony started talking we were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens we ll get there i know the question we ll get there i want to say something we ll get there alright erica medical the cloning the body parts like if people are sick and they need a new heart or new lungs or a new kidney ms scott i wrote the name of it it s called therapeutic cloning they refer to it that way so that s what it s called when you do that so when we re using it for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues whether it s like just a few cells or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries what do you think about that i think it s a good idea it s a good idea do you have any reasons to be worried about that it would be better than nothing any concerns anybody else have you heard of of a book called what was it called i don t think i have what s it about that s okay levon is going to have to read it now because he ll be like what it s about like in the future will people if parents don t want their kids any more they can like they can give them a like they can take their other body parts off and they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff so they like your body parts are still alive so one arm could be like your real arm and your other arm could be like interesting i ll have to read that book sometime now when they re doing the therapeutic cloning they re not actually creating like a whole new human and then the body parts up there s a couple of different ways they were doing it do you remember what they were using to how they were growing the organs that is true but what were they trying to do with the cloning how are they trying to avoid that do you remember does anybody remember how is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting because do you guys remember what happened to the woman close very close to that so remember when you get a body organ like the lady with the kidney right who d she get the kidney from her aunt yeah so she got it from her aunt somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family like they were a match she had to take remember all of those pills she had to take to make sure her body doesn t like get rid of the kidney and then unfortunately it still did so they re looking at getting making kidneys and i think that they were growing them inside of a cow i think it was a cow might have been a pig it was a big animal so you re going to grow human kidneys that are functional mm hmm on a cow they were using another animal and they were actually growing it like not in the animal it wasn t part of the animal they were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning so on the outside of a cow there d be kidneys underneath the skin yep and then they would take take them out and transplant them into humans this is like that episode of south park where it s a little bit inappropriate but not too much then let s not go there it s a little too inappropriate then let s not nevermind nevermind you re going to watch it for yourself fabulous but they are also trying by cloning because remember a lot of times they re trying to find animal parts that might match like for example did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart so you could have a pig heart they were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts the problem is of course is it s a pig s heart which means the outside of the heart looks like pig cells so your body would know that it s not a human heart it would know that it s a pig heart and your body probably won t want that in its body so they were trying remember they had trying to grow new pigs i think they had little piglets running around the pigs had human dna in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside so that when they keep those body parts if they put them in a human your body wouldn t recognize it as being something different did you know they ve actually done that my dad s friend s daughter has pig intestines,0.0

so good morning everyone good morning good morning today today what we have is we re going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced one was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that s required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent okay and so we had a field trip to wastewater treatment plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they re doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city so today i m going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates the overarching question is up on the board if you d like to see it it says how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws the environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city so i ll discuss the format of our debate first and that s again up on the board i will be finishing up my introduction here and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves who they represent and what their major goals are for today s debate okay then we ll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story so that our city council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said so city council members please be writing your notes when we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate it s going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing okay at the end each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today s debate good and then as i said at the end we will have a vote city council will vote on whether we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city are there any questions before we begin okay excellent and so i believe the this side had choice and so that means that corbin and his group for representing industry will be allowed to have that closing the last closing statement today and so we ll start with tyler and then we ll try to go back as fairly as possible back and forth so tyler if you d like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you re here today our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate we believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted the hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled while it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option excellent so corbin we re ready to hear your side and who you represent our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate we hope to persuade the epa and city council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness and that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that outstanding and so and then we will begin i guess then with tyler who can go ahead now and you can ask your first question and we ll be looking for city council members if you have any questions that need to be clarified statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it please raise your hand and we ll make sure that you get in immediately okay this is so funny okay we figure that since you say that our waters don t really need to be it already meets the standards of cleanliness but already in colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered as the more chemicals because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry have already become endangered and extinct and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water s clean enough okay let me ask you this do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish we have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the epa the standards that they re trying to enforce now like we saw on the video this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae algae blooms start to produce so it s mostly the nitrogen phosphate that s preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe technically okay i d like to follow this up with an article from i believe this is from the gazette which is our colorado springs newspaper since we re focusing this debate on colorado most likely our city we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms says the writer of this article so therefore when you talk about algae blooms we don t have a problem with this so why should we be focusing on it because the water runs off the lakes that does cause a problem with us okay but even if we did have i mean a few like i said again our city does not have problems with these so we can t therefore we can t focus our debate on these things because it doesn t apply to us well that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don t have problems with algae blooms but i ve been in the mountains around our area and i ve seen many lakes ponds just completely covered with algae and scum and that so many of our local creeks monument valley park and stuff are just littered with gross algae and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot and the same thing happened in the 1960s with lake erie and it later happened with chesapeake bay like we saw in the video and the same thing was happening where they said we don t need to fix it everything s fine and then just as nothing nobody did anything the lake soon was dead and it was like there s no fish in there and the water s just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes so doing nothing isn t really okay so i m gonna interject what i m hearing is that there s a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue so i d like to hear from somebody in the city council area who will be making a vote today how about your thoughts about the current water quality what you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently right now what level of danger are we at have you heard a lot about this do you feel like we are in need of serious change so we can direct the rest of the debate okay anybody who would like to contribute okay stephan well all i know is that where we re located we re at the we re pretty much the first people that use our water and then it goes downstream for other people to use it so so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution the pollutants that we put into the water it s not it wouldn t be really affecting our city but the cities that are down the stream from us okay but this article says that our excuse me i think i read this wrong our state does not have a problem with algae blooms regardless of the algae problem it says without the oxygen the fish bugs and other organisms that live in the water will die and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life but that s a worst case scenario that we don t have right now and we haven t had and it s not an issue in colorado granted it might be an issue in like chesapeake bay or lake erie but we don t have it here it says so and multiple scientists have backed that article as well now corbin do you have any measurements or do you have some values that you can back that up with not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous i tried to find some but i found so does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this okay i would like to comment on i m sorry behind you i just called on her oh excuse me so even if it s probable wouldn t you want to prevent it from like happening here with the algae well if it s not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening yeah if it happened but it hasn t happened yet yeah but what she s saying is it might happen yeah i mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might i mean i could say that you know an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow it might happen we don t know if it s going to happen but fish and other organisms are dying it is happening it s not necessarily just the algae but it s the future problem we ve already seen issues with the yeah let s see what nina has to say as far as city council well i just have a question wouldn t it be better to be safe than sorry you re right it would be better to be safe than sorry but like i said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the epa required standards so therefore it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the epa but we re saying that the epa standards need to be improved yes yes we realize that because they re not they re too low and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams and those chemicals are getting through how would you go about doing this how would you go about stopping the pollution because something that s important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it s something that s misconcepted is for example cars people think cars pollute the air and it exactly does pollute the air but when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it s also a pollutant therefore industry s not the only people who are polluting the lakes it s actually u s citizens doing the same work too okay i like that and so can you be more specific did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains yes that may cause issues yes okay i ve got a whole bunch of them alright corbin why don t you share then what it is you want me to read all of them or just so we re not focusing just on one group there may be other groups as well but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate go ahead corbin well the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he s found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants some of those examples were railroad ties dentures and he found a live person inside of them one time so it s not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there it s you can t stop humans from putting out waste and a lot of the stuff that they re putting in there that they re actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion which some of the machines there do do are poisonous things like fluoride which actually the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually mason which is right up there and lead and mercury and it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion well first of all i would like to answer mr dunmar s question or mr waz question i m sorry we do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water and it s 10 parts per million so that s just to answer that question and then to move on to yours yes of course as you said in your own words you can t stop people from the pollution that they do cause however it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment and when we don t have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people but for also the wildlife for the economy for you know natural systems that occur within colorado it s all you re putting it all on the line okay let s talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water okay well let s talk about the costs that everybody s the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying before you talk about cost would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying okay i would like to comment on that that s an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution i do have a statement from the secretary general of the united nations ban ki moon says more people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war you just said from the united nations yeah this isn t yes we re talking about a local issue now but that is a statement that proves that okay i would like to comment on this once more when you said united nations that s okay i m sorry we re going to have to go to hand raising i believe because we re getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish so theo finish up and then corbin will follow behind you no i made my point okay well like you said you do realize that s a local issue but the u n is united nations of the world so that s not a local issue you re bringing up a fact that s from countries like africa that don t have clean water at all nonetheless water so of course they re going to die from water poisoning but here in the united states we have the cleanest water in the world no matter where it is and colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water if you will out of all the states yeah because of the regulations we have in place and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water we need to restrict our regulations what are the new chemicals yeah they ve been there for awhile we re having new problems though can you explain it everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous it hasn t been an issue before why is it an issue now it has been an issue it absolutely has it has happened all over the united states okay when we talk about nitrogen we re talking about if we restrict that we re talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here as we all know that we are we do grow many crops in our state and nitrogen mostly where it comes from is fertilizers used in that industry so to say that we re going to restrict nitrogen would be we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food such as what what industries for fertilizers fertilizers you can t use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have and not even lawn crops crops lawns anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains which go into creeks which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was so shouldn t the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities we re already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into okay so will i hear you re saying that we re doing a lot what was learned on the field trip specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city what role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant and how does that affect your group s goals for today s debate what are the scientists doing specifically and how does it support your side like they said on the fieldtrip they use bacteria e coli to break down the wastewater that s in the water it s not like they re adding pollutions to it their job is to take it out which they are trying to do by doing that they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it but they remove a lot of those afterwards it s not like to clean it 100 it s going to cost 25 billion dollars and that s just for the state of colorado okay let s see a city council members i m trying to get to them quickly i m sorry amanda behind you stephan where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars this is from the gazettte the gazette article it s from the article science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water which is you guys s goal to restrict it it s going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all if you just want to do parts of it it s still going to be 2 46 billion dollars which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water wouldn t that be better tough than having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy well i actually on the fieldtrip i asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into fountain creek and what we re doing for the environment and they said the water they put back into fountain creek is the water they get out of it it s cleaner than that yeah so in my opinion that statement is totally absurd we re putting cleaner water for nature and nature seems to enjoy it more as i asked the chemist as well and farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops and it helps their crops grow more than fountain creek s streams already excellent point corbin why don t we try alexis and see what she has to say i have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy you can say a lot about the economy what do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy well you say that,0.0
that s a start ok devon and sasha 3 1 3 what are the classifications natural no not natural rational yes rational real yes ok it s rational and it s real now brian you had first said natural yeah i kinda because a fraction isn t natural ok right a fraction is not natural who else can tell us something about natural numbers then what do we know about our natural numbers they re the counting numbers yeah ok counting numbers what do we mean by that the counting numbers numbers that you count with like one two three ok our natural numbers are our counting numbers so 3 1 3 again was just a rational rational and a real ok very good somebody else ok go ahead natalie square root of 19 what are the classifications rational hold on one second thank you can you show us your number so the square root of 19 ok irrational it s irrational i decided it s irrational cause it s the square root of a nonperfect number nonperfect square nonperfect square ok so sasha and christina both agree that it s irrational and christina what else did you say i m not sure if they heard it s a nonperfect square ok it s not a perfect square and it s also real ok it is irrational and we wanna remember that an irrational number is also a real number even though it doesn t end or repeat how did you know without using your calculator that the square root of 19 was an irrational number it doesn t make a perfect square ok and how do you know it doesn t make a perfect square because i have no idea if you multiply two numbers you don t get it ok very good that s exactly right you actually can multiply two numbers to get 19 it s just a decimal or yeah it s an irrational decimal it s an irrational decimal ok so you can multiply and we looked at an example of that we did a little activity with the square root of 19 is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply to get 19 mm mmm and that s what makes it irrational compared with if you did like the square root of 16 what two numbers can you multiply to get four and four four and four ok good ok how bout another number go ahead the classifications of 1 3 rational and real ok rational real anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1 3 mm hmm the greater the decimal it s repeating right it s a repeating decimal it doesn t end but it does repeat ok so if it were if it was you could get a rational number right and that makes it a rational number very good ok we looked at several numbers how about someone ask a question someone wanna throw in a question ok go ahead scotty what integers are also whole numbers ok what integers and let s make sure everybody s having the opportunity to answer questions repeat that again what integers are also whole numbers ok so what integers are also whole numbers two can be a whole and an integer ok what did you say first two ok two is an example it can be an integer and a whole number positive numbers positive numbers ok our positive numbers negative numbers could be too can negative numbers be whole numbers though no no it can zero ok zero positive numbers ok who remembers what example did i give you when we re thinking about whole numbers pets what can help you think about whole numbers pets ok sasha says pets who can elaborate on what that means the number of pets you have count the number of pets you have and then we asked for a number or something they wouldn t say like i have 3 4 of a dog or something ok so if you d ask somebody how many pets they have their answers are always gonna be what a whole number a whole number which and what are our whole numbers zero one zero to infinity zero through all the way ok mm hmm zero and all alright good good question scotty let s have another question go ahead luke is a negative number rational or irrational ok turn that around so we can see so is a negative number can it be classified as rational or irrational it would be a rational number no a negative number is a rational number it would be both yeah it would be both if you have the square root of a negative number it s an integer take the square root of a negative number an integer is always rational so an integer is rational and a negative number is a is rational but his question let s see that again is a negative number so it could be rational can we have a negative number that s irrational can somebody give me an example of that negative pi ok negative pi mm hmm the negative square root of two ok the negative square root of a number would the negative have to be on the outside or the inside of the pi outside the pi i mean outside the square root sign so luke can you conclude us what was your answer to that question sometimes both ok it can be both mm hmm good alright good question too what about another number what s another number madison go ahead the square root of 144 ok the square root of 144 who can give us the different classifications real ok damian says real natural natural whole whole integer yeah integer any others rational ok it s rational do you agree madison yes ok very good so we looked at when that s if we look at our graphic organizer when it starts here with natural we read this going out that it has all those different classifications good ok how about another number go ahead amy what is the difference between these two numbers the negative square root of nine and the square root of negative nine ok i like that question so what s the difference between those two so on the first example we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign and then we see it on the inside one s real and one s not ok damian says one s real and one s not when it s in the inside it s not real because you can t take the square root of a negative number exactly we cannot take the square root of a negative number so when we see it on the inside there s not a solution to it what about when it s on the outside you can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign ok so what would that answer be negative square root of nine negative three right negative three let s talk a little bit more in depth about when that negative is inside the square root why do we not have a solution to that so it was a square root of negative nine because you can t multiply two numbers to get a negative right exactly so if we had like the square root of nine what two numbers can we multiply to give us three oh nine three and three three and three and remember how we talked about what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number squaring it mm hmm so there s not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine good alright let s have another number go ahead brock ok 3 14 pi i m glad you showed that number 3 14 that is not pi it s rational and real it s irrational no it s rational it s not rational because it never ends or repeats it is rational yeah but 3 14 ends yes it ends it s 3 14 not pi that s not pi pi doesn t end that one ends pi doesn t end ok so are we all in agreement that the number pi is an irrational number that doesn t end or repeat yes but what is brock s number 3 14 3 14 so that number 3 14 ends it ends so what are the classifications for that number rational and real it s rational and real now when we re working problems like area or circumference of a circle why do we use 3 14 because it s easier because it s easier right could we use a whole number for pi to do a calculation no no way it s gonna end right it would never end so when we re doing our calculations we use that 3 14 but brock i m glad you had that number so you know there s that difference pi doesn t end but just 3 14 does end mm hmm square root of negative 41 ok can you show everyone your number so the square root of negative 41 not real ok not a real number but if it was real then and they were on the outside then it d be irrational wouldn t it ok and why would that be irrational the square root of 41 mm hmm no two numbers that can multiply not the same two whole numbers let me ask you a question about the square root of 41 what if your neighbor came and said i d like for you to help me make a fenced in area for my dog and i want it to be a square and i want the area to be 41 how would you maybe respond to your neighbor make it 49 ok cause it wouldn t be a square it wouldn t be a perfect square if it was 41 ok so you what did you say damian to make it like 41 so you could have a seven by or 49 so you could have seven by seven ok good or make it a six by six 36 ok i would tell him to make it way bigger because a dog needs a lot of space no that wouldn t actually be a very big area would it no that would be small unless maybe it was a small dog yes a really small dog like a teacup chihuahua ok how about another question oh ok are repeating decimals ever fractions no yes 1 3 so you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction yeah 1 3 ok 2 6 it s a bunch of threes yes ok 1 3 definitely that was the number damian had a bunch of threes and you said now two what about 2 6 it s repeating also ok cause that will reduce back to what 1 3 1 3 ok alright how about another number ethan square root of two alright i don t know if you can see that but the square root of two what if you try to take the square root of two it s irrational irrational ok it s an irrational number but it s also a real real number good alright another number that we can look at maybe someone who s not answered down here nicole five divided by zero oh that s a good one we ve not had that how about five divided by zero it s not real that s not real ok not a real number again can we go a little bit further why is that not a real number because there s no longer a number you can multiply by it s zero anything divided by zero is not a real number ok i had several of you talking and i do want to hear everyone what did you say natalie it s undefined ok we do say that s undefined michael could you add to that you can t divide anything by zero ok you can t divide anything by zero and if you look on the overhead if i were to write that out and put five inside as our dividend and zero as our divisor is there a number i can multiply by zero to get five no cause anything times zero is zero so that makes it undefined ok very good ok another number ooh ooh ok cliff go ahead and then brock you had your hand raised i ll come back to you the square root of 53 ok hold that up so everyone can see ok we have the square root of 53 classifications for square root of 53 irrational irrational and real and real very good ok brock how about your number ok the square root of a prime number is always what ok brock s given us a question can you repeat that again the square root of a prime number is always what oh that s a very good question irrational ok so if it s a prime number and you re trying to take the square root it s always irrational ethan you said irrational can you expand on that i said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number you have to have two for it to be a perfect square you have to have two numbers prime numbers and you have one and the number itself ok only those two factors right ok very good ok maybe another question mm hmm is a repeating decimal rational or irrational so if it s a repeating decimal rational rational yes ok very good how about another question that we could discuss madison true or false a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats it s false ok it s false what does that mean mariah if it s terminating it so if it terminates it it ends it ends right exactly ok how about another number anyone an example we ve not had many with integers i see you how about one with a negative number anybody have one with a negative number brian you do ok i have the square root of negative 225 not real ok not real again why is that not a real number because it s negative the decimal s inside ok well not the decimal is inside but the negative the negative s inside i wanna throw a number out how about negative 4 5 for the number negative 4 5 rational yeah rational ok it s a rational number and it is a real number is it a negative number yes no yeah no hmmm so negative 4 5 wouldn t that be considered an integer no because it s not a whole or a natural number ok very good what do we know we haven t talked too much about integers what do we know about our integers how do we classify an integer that it s whole numbers and their opposites ok whole numbers and their opposites and we used our number line in class do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line no so what numbers are not considered integers decimals decimals and fractions ok so if they have that negative sign in front of them then what do we call em if they re not integers,0.0
so here s the first set i thought i d start a little bit easy so go ahead and within your groups now i ll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate how to figure out which one it is okay go ahead you can uh you can you use beer s law for this right you aren t able to taste that you aren t able to that s not big enough our okay so doesn t dissociate how s the temperature boil it yeah that s the only way so the one with the highest concentration s going to have the highest boiling point yeah you could freeze it and weigh it okay freezing it the point three would have the most weight weight yeah but which one would freeze first point one point one would freeze first because there s less okay what else point three weighs more but we would need to freeze it first no what we wouldn t need to freeze it the first one being would be with the tasting one or the volume one i don t know the tasting one okay you say the tasting one you say the volume one whichever one comes first the one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one right okay so the one that boils the fastest point one you could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes alright so we can have equal volumes of each solution right and then after like a certain time alright that s it everybody stop stop stop stop okay so who want to go first we ll start with with miles i think you had your hand up first so go ahead what s one way that you can identify these things well you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0 3 molar 0 2 would be the middle and 0 1 would be the least okay if they were all the same volume ahh yeah you guys heard that now good good listening skills on that if they were the same volume at the beginning alright does everybody agree so one method is boil away and weigh did you say weigh how do you know which one has the most i would imagine you could weigh it right you could weight it start with equal volumes okay there s several other ways how about joseph if you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration okay anybody have comments on that jimmy i don t think we re able to distinguish the taste that well because our mouth isn t that sensitive okay miles what if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there so there s two concerns obviously i think miles is the most important you know you guys can see that i m smart enough to put the right substances i keep forgetting i m getting old and i may go in the back and i reach for the lead nitrate or something right and then the other part what do you guys think of the other part could you taste the difference between a 0 2 0 3 and a 0 1 and just say ah that s the sweetest one it s kind of hard miles you d need some salt the problem i think is this is something we would actually need to try right i don t think this is a theoretical thing that we re trying to we re practicing theory here we would actually have to do this in a lab right i would imagine we would wouldn t it be different for every person because we could it could be different for every person right because i can t see as well as you for example maybe right so there could be variations in tasting of those ian given excess humans oh wait you re on the next one no on this one alright i didn t get that either okay so let s look at another method alright we re not going to list that one because we don t want to be tasting things okay so paran your group what about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0 1 would have the most and 0 3 would have the least because there s more sugar covering it what do you guys think okay juan he didn t say how you could measure it the way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure everybody agree yeah okay so that was my concern too right how do you measure the vapor pressure you re not wrong but how do measure it and thank you juan for bringing that up could you repeat that okay so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they d always be evaporating the one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0 1 molar would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time so i m going to write this as evaporation rate who s got another method different view alright jimmy okay so you re gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 then the second one is 0 2 the last one 0 1 what do you guys think could you repeat that so you re going to take equal amounts take it into the light make sure it s the same conditions for each one and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 second is 0 2 last is 0 1 what do you guys think i know some of you guys are thinking that s bio but you took it most of you at least right so we could finish this what do you think wouldn t it take a long time for the algae to start growing it s going to work right nobody sees where s the algae you re always asking me come one folks you think about this i m going to say the problems but i want you to tell me first alright alright let s go with ivan i don t think the results would be consistent because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason so because you didn t mention how much algae you put in there could be an issue there what else though no juan you go alright i don t think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place so i think juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things not just amount of sugar and amount of water there could be other nutrients is that what you re saying yeah nutrients and other things of that sort could i just back up for a sec algae produces sugar right assuming that you re talking about algae that grows they use carbon dioxide so my hunch is there s several right one i think as ivan pointed out you ve got to put in a certain amount why don t you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end you picked algae so yeah although is that a bad idea it could work but we have to be careful with conditions a lot of conditions need to be met anything else you boil them hold on let these guys go if you have equal volumes and you add heat to them 0 1 should boil first okay so you could use boiling point elevation i wrote this down before we even discussed it but everybody agrees that works right so what s another easy one that we boiling point elevation right you need me to repeat that or you got it what immediately follows with that idea freezing point depression freezing point depression okay what else i have a question for you then could we use beer s law for this no tell me why could we use beer s law for this ian you have your hand up at first glace i would say no because i do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution what do you guys think yep don t you need color unless what unless come on keep going with this stuff not you ian you spoke i d like to have as many people participate as possible alright nick go ahead you could add food coloring possibly yeah you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker possibly nick we re trying to figure out the difference between these right yeah what do you mean add you mean add a drop to each of these yeah but then what would you be measuring the food coloring you wouldn t be measuring the sugar you know what i mean yeah i know what you mean you re still okay with that uh i don t know wait nick if you add food coloring how much one drop yeah okay one drop to each of these right now they all look the same don t they yeah and if i stick this in my spectral photometer they should all measure the same did i succeed in figuring out which one is which you understand that right yeah yeah okay nat could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads that s interesting could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads you d have to indicate that high concentration would teacher hang on but once again we have to be careful of conditions right all the temperatures have to be the same what do you guys think sure why would that work because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it s not able to spread through the molecules so that would be in the 0 3 science glad you like it alright how about wait gevorg hasn t spoken so i m thinking gevorg it s your turn buddy what did you want to add you wanted to add a new technique okay go ahead if we did a benedict s test i don t know if it would just turn the same color because i m not sure how the benedict s reacts with different concentrations but maybe if you put the same amount of benedict s and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test what do you guys think benedict s is a reaction between this benedict s stuff with sugar to show the presence of sugar what comes out of the reaction i m not sure but it s a color change oh well the more color change but if the color change is too intense it could just be like it s all going to change that color or not see what i m saying that s what your pointing out right so again that sounds like an experimental one could i share one more how about this you know when you take your ap test you just don t know what and we started with something that i think is sort of easy could you use density what do you guys think someone who hasn t talked yet could we use density and how do we use density what do you guys think no alright ian since nobody s going for it do i have to say it go ahead and say it tell me how tell us how take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it exactly which one s going to weigh the most the one that has the most sugar okay if you take equal volumes this one will weigh the most this will be the most dense the more sugar you add the denser it gets you know this right does anybody have any more alright let s move on set number two now this says solid and i m trying to get you to see a different range on these go ahead and talk about it i ll give you a minute or so colors conductivity we could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity well they re solid you have to remember so solid has a lot of problems with it that s just solving it it s hard to conduct a current well you could dissolve it it s doable it s just a little difficult potassium then um wait calcium what about ph sensing so cacl2 well they re solids oh if you put them into a solvent yeah can we put them into solvents can we make it into so lead can t dissolve in water right lead i mean lead chloride no lead chloride will not dissolve in water but then kcl and cacl2 would they would so you can rule that out that s one way but then how do you figure out between the other solution couldn t there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate i wouldn t say form a precipitate i would say actually i m thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn t dissolve at all with boiling point elevation freezing point depression because you re going to have more little bits in the cacl2 than the kcl as an end result calcium chloride potassium chloride get what pbcl2 does nothing so after that if you boil it right calcium chloride potassium the higher value alright you guys that s it let s gather up okay some of you guys just got back so you guys know what we re doing right yes okay let s get it together alright everybody stop now christina you had your hand up first take the easiest one what s the easiest way to distinguish these you could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them and then pbcl2 would be the heaviest and the kcl would be the lightest equal volumes i mean equal amounts what s an amount though like grams but if i take equal grams then i could have ten grams of this ten grams of this ten grams of that no i didn t say that alright what did you say then i meant like equal equal what volume volume okay now let s answer that one what do you guys think she s saying take let s say 10 milliliters 10 milliliters 10 milliliters and this one s going to weigh the most this one would weigh which one s second oh sorry second would be cacl2 okay so this one would be second what do you guys think someone other than ian okay ian go ahead does atomic weight atomic mass directly influence listen to this miles does atomic mass directly influence density that s the question does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids they re all ionic compounds and the answer to that is no you cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass that this is the most dense okay where just to follow that up where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works ivan oh wait let s give it to him just he s just walked in niresh is it in gases gases right does everybody agree gases you could do that if the formula mass is high on a gas then it s going to have more density could you do that for liquids now could you do that for liquids ivan you could do it if it s all the same subsets for different concentrations,0.0
do you know how to make a u shape like this you re gonna make the u shape with this first it s gonna make a u you re making sod homes what are sod homes tell me what all you know about a sod home there were some homes that were dug out that were built the dugouts were in a hill okay tell me what else you know about sod home okay and why did they use sod to make houses yeah okay so they didn t have trees what kind of land were they on a prairie a prairie and what is a prairie it s a flat kind of land and it never has any trees okay okay would you have wanted to live in a sod home i d choose a log cabin where okay were there any good things about a sod home um yeah what is something good about a sod home okay what are the walls like in a sod home are they thick are they thick walls okay okay did they have any furniture in their sod homes they did why didn t they have furniture jd why didn t they have furniture in their sod homes because they weren t i think abby do you know why they they didn t have furniture in their sod homes no but did they bring their furniture with them no because of the wagon it would take up the whole wagon okay so what did they bring what did they bring hannah a gun they did they brought a gun and food okay so they didn t bring their furniture with them why not why didn t they bring their furniture cause it was too big and it would take up the whole wagon okay okay didn t they have more than one wagon yes that s right a wagon train very good okay i m gonna leave you guys to work and i m gonna be back and check on your sod homes okay it smells very good okay and i ll help you i see that you have trunks why do you have a trunk oh that s very nice to help eli why do you all have trunks because um the pioneers had them the pioneers had trunks why why did they have trunks for their clothes and stuff and toys and toys like we re making the doll okay what were trunks made out of wood wood oh you guys are sharing it s so great thank you so their trunks were made out of wood what kind of homes did they live in sod houses and log homes sod houses and log homes log cabins and log cabins okay that s right that s right and so when they traveled when they left their homes what did they travel in a covered wagon a covered wagon was there just one wagon no they got in a wagon train a wagon train and what was a wagon train it s a bunch of covered wagons oxen in a wagon train in a wagon train would you have wanted to be at the front or the back of the wagon train why i have an idea erase erase erase erase you won t get that dirty you won t get that dirty why would you not get that dirty at the front because they can t move their okay okay what would happen in the wagon train would they take care of each other yeah okay what if a wheel broke off of a wagon they would have to help each other okay okay they would help each other tell me this eli where was the wagon where were the wagons going west they were going west why were they going west cayden they thought they would settle the land okay karev why did the government give them free land okay they were what did they have to do on that land build a house okay build a house that s right that s right so what kind of house did they build a sod house they made a sod house why did they not make a wood house because there weren t a lot of trees on the prairie okay but you said the trunks were made out of wood how did they get trunks made out of wood because they made it before they left they made it before they left that s correct can the doll have long hair you re doing a great job you re just gonna have to imagine that that s right they made their trunks before they left did they just need one trunk no okay twice okay do you know eli can you go show me on the map where the pioneers went on the prairie where the prairie was okay and what is that the prairie the prairie and how do you know it s a prairie because there s no like mountains there how do you know there s no mountains because these are the mountains just like regular colors are not okay and so on the prairie what kind of homes did they build sod houses sod houses so where did they build their log houses at right in this area okay very good and why did they build em there what was there wood a lot of wood good job you can go sit down thank you you did a great job very good job did they take everything with them on the trip why did they not take everything with them okay so when they got there did they have furniture to put into their sod homes no because they just moved in they had just moved in where there good things about a sod home eli what was good about a sod home that s right and what made them that way because the ground is cooler okay the ground is cooler were the log homes good as well yeah okay but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house it s not warm in winter and do you remember when we did a venn diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two yeah so that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through what was the best structure to live in a log cabin a log cabin so that animals couldn t get on top of it and if you lived in a dug out cayden would you if it came a big rain storm would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out back why it s a dryer place isn t it okay you guys continue to work okay tell me what you know about a log house willie tell me something you know about a log house okay they didn t have any air conditioners kennedy you guys are making a log house what are you putting in your log house dolls and some family and some furniture okay did they have a lot of furniture for their log house brody did they have furniture for their log house yeah but when they got there they had to have time to gather up some furniture that s right when they first moved there they didn t have any furniture but eventually they built some didn t they i see you re putting a fireplace in there what did they burn in their fireplace they were burning um buffalo chips they are in a log house they re burning buffalo chips that s right in a sod house they re gonna burn buffalo chips why not wood in a sod house because in a prairie they would run out of if they had enough wood they would build a wood house build a log house that s exactly right were there buffalo chips where there were log houses no why were there not buffalo chips so buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were where did the buffalo live what was it called the prairie the prairie and what is a prairie open grasslands that s exactly right and what are you making dillon a quilt why are you making a quilt tell me why the pioneers needed quilts for to sit on them what else did they do with them willie they on them when they were on their way what else dillon okay did they not have beds yes no they didn t okay that s right okay they had to sleep on the floor are you putting a kitchen in your log house no because they well where did they keep their food at the root cellar where tell me about a root cellar what s a root cellar it s where they kept their frozen food okay was it inside the log cabin or was it outside outside okay and what was the root cellar like okay brody you re exactly right that is great thinking that is great thinking did they keep any food inside their homes yes what d they keep inside their homes flour and sugar flour and sugar and where would they have kept those in what container what kind of container were they barrels that they put them in yeah yeah they were barrels you guys are doing a great job and you re working together and i m gonna come back and check on you in a little bit all right look what i made what is that willie it s what a lantern a lantern why do you have a lantern in your log house okay and so you can see yeah that s right cause they didn t have electricity did they cause they had so they could see to cook good thinking i need to do my little girl okay i ll do the girl,0.0
how you guys doing so 3 oh what did you do by touching those it made a short circuit it crossed wow the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple yeah it s only 3 why do you think that is 03 maybe because it s like different rods or something oranges are more sour than the other fruit not and like have more acid or something because it stops the energy we want it a half centimeter apart right yeah two centimeters around so okay go ahead make sure they aren t touching 0 1 it s not even measuring at all oh 0 1 0 01 oh 01 that s crazy i know how this supposed to be one the other two were so high 0 98 i never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy except for oranges i thought this would have as much as the apple my hypothesis i actually thought that the orange would have the most go ahead alright lizzy you can do the voltage reader stick them in a half centimeter apart and a centimeter in okay lizzy make sure they don t touch don t short circuit them it s like completely zero the bigger it is the more volts it has the middle one it left like a little here and this was the most i think it s more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else hmm i wonder why that would be okay so now we have to get a calculator okay so 0 22 plus 0 09 plus 0 28 i got 0 1966667 so what are you gonna do with that number round it up okay 0 20 but wait doesn t someone else need to try it oh yeah yeah yeah that s a good idea 0 22 plus 0 oh never mind divided by three i got the same answer so what was the answer to the investigative question what do you think the the apple had the most do you agree with that yes why do you think that is do you have any guesses it s it s bigger it could carry more volts it has yeah it has like more juice yeah that s true i think the juice was your hypothesis correct actually it was like right here well well actually i said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with but i guess apples would work better what was yours i thought the i thought the carrots would produce more because you know usually when you like eat one it s like very wet wet when you just get them so i thought the carrot was going to win but guess not i thought it was the apple i already said that my hypothesis i thought i think the potato would have the most because i heard like i ve heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts so i suspected that they may have been have a lot of voltage also okay to our investigative question our question was which fruit will produce the most energy and the kiwi kiwi and apple had tied for it 0 98 so i don t know maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results i wonder why the orange was so low though maybe because we since we put it too deep or something no we did the same thing we put all of them yeah i know well so then our so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest so how about your hypothesis i thought orange would have it i thought orange would have it i thought orange had it too and had the highest why because it had like i thought the apple would because we didn t i thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was how about you kirsten what did you think i thought the orange because it has more citrus in it i mean yeah i would have thought kiwi would have less because it s so small yeah me too that s what i thought then what was our evidence apple had for an average had 0 98 orange had 0 16 and then kiwi had 0 06 0 16 and then kiwi had 0 98 so kiwi and apple tied and then our evidence is our data table because that s where we recorded everything yep so then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation we did them the same length apart and so what are you guys trying to figure out over here we re we re trying to figure out what if the apple carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery what is the food representing in this case a battery okay yeah okay how you gonna figure that out what is your plan we are gonna do gonna try to do a voltage reader and put try to see how much voltage there is in an apple potato or a carrot i think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage well like the apple but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an s battery series series let s do series let s try series it lights up more yeah it s brighter okay let s get it done oh wait we re gonna need more there s a wire in here so i think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter or at all because it has i think it s gonna have the most it has the most voltage and so it ll make it become brighter which do you oh wait we re doing a series battery so maybe we where s the other apple it s over there reece has it need to wrap it around tight can i check jayden do you wanna do it sure i ll have the honors keep this one untouched because i m gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to this negative just the white one okay there is no wire in this okay so i think we have enough wires here what do you need the wires for to wrap around to make a series to allow the energy to flow through okay so what s the purpose of the wires so that the energy will be able to flow what is the energy that s going through the wires electricity but okay so what is the function of the wires to like be able to pass from one spot to like the battery to the light okay so you have two different wires why is that to be able to you know why you have two different wires um no no i m gonna give you a minute to think about it okay is it working no not yet well i don t think it s working i think i didn t oh it s going no i don t think i wrapped the wire around right oh yeah because the this is really short so yeah it was tucking it let s see that and that and that yeah that thing s wrapped up tight well if the volts are enough don t the apples have to be touching no they don t have to be touching they just have to be the wires just have to go from positive to negative yeah true but if they don t have enough voltage we should use a potato yeah we can put the potato to help yeah we need to put them in every fruit and then connect the wires like that to that that to that so make sure they don t touch yeah so kinda wrap it around with the wire yeah try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that do you what do you guys think do you think that fruit could power our school i don t think so it might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here but you don t think there s enough voltage to supply our whole school no well like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something i don t know how that would turn out but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top would you think that would be economical you think that would be beneficial to us in any way maybe why it could but we d have to keep changing out the fruit and changing out the fruit it d be lots more work that s for sure don t let them touch that connects to that and that do we have another one because this one is broken can we borrow one from over here oh we have one there you go what do you think is gonna happen i think it ll like because we have none of the same touching first we should check the voltage well i don t we ll just see if it lights the light no don t connect those why would you wanna check the voltage just to see if it has enough potential of battery would make more electricity all the averages i think it should be good this way because we tested a battery and saw how much it was connect one to it then connect yours lizzy maybe did we do it wrong no i don t think so well i think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit maybe it try an separate those a little more kirsten maybe they re both plus and plus maybe it s because we re using three types of fruit if we use just two what if we took the prongs out and replace that with this okay try that put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it well don t what are we trying to do here we were trying to make all these the same one why would you do that maybe because they need to be the same from the both positive and negative oh and we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus doesn t matter which way and that and that needs to touch and then that one and that one which is exactly what we did but wait,0.0
the yellow has less water that s true and more h plus because a higher concentration of the higher the concentration of the acid yes yes so you think it s something about the acid that s causing the color yeah what about the blue food coloring this stays the same yeah but why would you think this stays the same and it s the acid that s changing color okay so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same but the amount of acid is not so i must be changing the color of the acid so it s the acid that s changing color you re not changing the color of the acid though anybody else got ideas about that that something else that could explain it that s one hypothesis you put the same amount of food coloring in every time right yeah wait so the acid is probably likely to maybe like lose an electron the acid loses electrons what is an acid it gives up an h plus right there are more moles of hydrogen ions right acid s dissociate so i got more molds of h plus in this one okay emma you have an idea well there are more i think i might have gotten it confused basically there s a higher concentration of acid as you go along right so more here yeah there s more when it s lighter lowest most yeah i know okay so that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change then because there are more h pluses if you will that could cause it to jump in energy okay so you got the idea of energy is some kind of something s jumping because you know could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that s changing okay which is why the blue color changes to the like brownish yellow so now what is your idea about what s changing color the orbital the food coloring is changing color the food coloring is changing color yeah the food okay so that makes sense the food coloring is changing color but the acid concentration is making it change color yeah so the food coloring s like the dependent variable right what is in the food coloring that s a good question that s what we need to know what is in the food coloring the same thing that s in the cabbage indicator actually well something similar they re called anthocyanins and i have a little handout to show you what they look like so before we do that though actually no i ll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here so here s an anthocyanin it s this molecule here so usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them okay so what is happening what is causing the different colors so we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping in the food coloring in the food coloring but the food coloring isn t transition metal it s not a transition metal no can you still have that happen well what else could there be well i think it s the o h because is it like splitting up the p orbitals what makes you say that there s like sp 3 orbitals and i guess p2 orbitals okay so are you saying it s that splitting of sp 3 and sp 2 orbitals or the p orbitals i was thinking it s the p orbitals okay so what here would represent the p orbitals whatever bonded with the acid the o h maybe oh would it be the no okay so here s what we re going to do i m going to give you this handout and what i would like you to do i want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color then i want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color okay you should have highlighters by your table purple i ll take green do you want us to do it for all of them yeah let s just do it let s do it for the first one to start with anthocyanins in red wine we ll do that so anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds anything that has color really wine grapes cabbage red onions food coloring are they they re not in colorless though right or are they say it again they can t be colorless because it s colorless well kind of you ll see we ll explain that in a little bit yeah is something colorless because they don t have any d electrons or like the d orbital is filled up with electrons or are there other factors yes that s true for transition metals but for other things for other things that are colorless what would explain why they were colorless it would have to be a different orbital different wave length like the absorption based on the bond yes to both of you so riley s idea is that maybe so what did we say color came from earlier color in general where does color in general come from reflecting certain frequencies and absorbing other frequencies of light right okay so we can only see purple to red so is there another explanation for why something might be colorless because it probably because it s absorbing everything well if it was absorbing everything what color would it be black oh it s not absorbing anything it s not absorbing anything or not absorbing any color it s not absorbing what we can see it s not absorbing what we can see that s right it s not absorbing what we can see it reflects all the colors so you guys see a pattern yet can i borrow somebody s let me borrow yours let s put it under the camera as an example here what do you notice were we supposed to highlight single bonds yes what do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds the double bonds right next to each other the double bonds are next to the single bonds the double bond are next to the single bonds that s right that s right okay in the first one where you have what color is the first one does is say it just says colored red wine but we have colored and we have colorless okay so in the colored one how many can you count how many times it goes double single double single double single that s like a tongue twister it s seven in colored i got seven okay so now count colorless and see what you get what did you guys get for double single i got like 14 okay so are you counting double and single as yeah yeah okay so you basically got seven too okay so do colorless now double bonds between every single bond between the bonds with the c n o i got eight for colored i got 17 in the singles and eight doubles for that okay what s the difference between colored and colorless basically and the number of double and single bonds there are more singles than colorless okay not the total numbers oh wait there s more singles than colorless okay that s a way we can look at it okay see if the same we got seven for colorless okay is it supposed to be the same number no no no it s not supposed to be the same alright let s hear what gracie has to say say what you just said so in colored there s more doubles and there s less singles so that means that there s going to be more of the single doubles but then in colorless there s less doubles and more singles so that means there s less single doubles can somebody restate that just so that i can make sure that you understand what she said does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are that colors so say it again when there are more double bonds there s a color or something okay when there s more double bonds there s a color does that seem like the pattern we re noticing here it has to do with pi bonding why does it have to do with pi bonding because it s an overlap of p orbitals overlap of p orbitals which allows the delocalized electrons to like okay so what did you say con delocalization delocalization the delocalization comes from pi bonds what is a pi bond it s the overlap of what p orbitals p orbitals p orbitals okay so when it goes double single double single double single what s happening there how does that create it s like one big pi bond like when you have like earlier you were talking about whatcha ma call its i can t articulate delocalization no like one giant p orbital yeah like sort of yeah one giant p orbital like one giant pi bond it like expands from like through different oh and like a benzene shape and then that makes a circle yeah and it s not actually like here s one here s one pi bond here s one pi bond here s one it s like they re like all pi bonded they re like all pi bonded to each other okay so in which case in which case are they all pi bonded to each other the colored form or the colorless form i d say colored because they are all close to each other like the pi bonds the pi bonds say it again they re close to each other they re close to each other in the colored form so is there more there s more double bonds there s more double bonds in the colored yeah so they would have to be closer to each other there are more double bonds in colored less double bonds in colorless okay so how many of you say there s less double bonds in the colorless less double bonds in the colorless three there s only seven double bonds in colorless and there s eight in colored and there s more leftover singles wait for which one for colored oh you re counting the far left one yeah this one has eight this is an intermediate one so then it s seven and seven seven and seven okay so how many if you were to try to connect so the idea is that it makes one giant p orbital if you were going to connect all of the p orbitals which one would have the most gigantic p orbital colored colored is that clear to everybody why did you say colorless did you say colorless yeah i don t understand why because there s a bunch of single bonds because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things wait for the far left does that make any sense we re talking about the far left one let s look at all three so which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond the middle one the middle one because it s an intermediate and they re more double bonds does anyone disagree that it s going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p orbital okay alright let s look at some more down here did you guys do does somebody have these highlighted no i think rebecca you have them highlighted right okay so let s look at these two here can we apply our hypothesis so what is our hypothesis by the way more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is okay the more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is that s our hypothesis is it supported by these two on the side here can we highlight the exterior so what do you think is our hypothosis supported by these two alright con can you explain well i mean it just looks like there s a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double single is kind of broken okay right so there s a streak of double single double single double single double single double single so imagine you start somewhere have you guys ever heard the song that never ends yes this is the song that never ends okay we re not gonna sing it it never ends so in this case if we were to just go around going double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single would i ever get to an end necessarily would i here how about if i went double still single double single double single double single but that s single single single single so which one s going to have a more extensive pi bond the top one so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is the more colored it is okay so what causes color in these compounds shared electrons more shared electrons that are shared how pi bonds more pi bonds equals what more area for the electrons to move around okay more area for them more delocalization okay so let s take it back to this to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration why are these different colors what is happening here let s put this together oh is it the h is taking more of the delocalized electrons because h is positive what do you think because there s a higher concentration so say it again okay so since h is a positive ion it takes more of the since there s more it takes more of the delocalized electrons okay so it s taking more of the delocalized electrons so how does that explain the color change can somebody add onto that there s less electrons so i guess there s less more double bonding there s less energy absorbed no there s increased so is more energy being absorbed or less energy being absorbed when it s yellow more energy is being absorbed that s why it s yellow exactly that creates further because there are more electrons bonding with the h plus than there is in the it s about absorption ah okay ruth say that,0.0
okay what s in here do me a favor go up and tell me what i m gonna need put i put down the if he s right say okay boys and girls because it is raining i need my one two three umbrella what happened to that thing i like red matches my jacket maybe because it s raining this this protects me from the rain so because it is raining i need a one two three umbrella umbrella umbrella i might put that here maybe i ll need it okay maybe i ll need it later okay boys and girls so let s keep going boys and girls since it is i ll need my you wanna try it come up come up i don t know i don t know oh so now ooh okay so nice job because it is one two three snowing i ll need my gloves what type of gloves i have these gloves are these gloves the type of gloves i need no are these gloves the type of gloves i need yes no i think i don t think these will work these gloves say it with me gloves gloves now just people in pink gloves gloves oh there s a lot of people wearing pink okay just boys gloves just girls gloves very nice just people from china gloves just people from south america gloves all right there we go there we go all right let s keep moving okay boys and girls it is so i ll need my we re right here what is this what s going on here windy so windy so windy what do i need tina come on up come on up i don t know maybe i ll use this okay so tina tina one two three guys because it is windy okay in chinese it s okay i ll need my jacket all right all right great great great great so guys i just wanna say one thing i wanna say that these words i m using are cause and effect words and we have some examples of clothing here that you re gonna need and i want you to focus for a second with this say it with me since since because because so so boys and girls these are words you use when speaking when you re talking about cause and effect when speaking because it s snowing i need my heavy jacket that s cause and effect these are words we use with speaking these words let s say them just one time for a little pronunciation practice thus thus therefore therefore consequence three syllables con se quence consequence all right good good and the fact is and the fact is these are pretty much words we re gonna use in writing only we don t really speak these words not often very rare these we used in speaking since because and so and these are the words you re gonna be using today you re gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships these are more when you re writing an essay an essay like maybe for the ela or when you re writing an academic essay okay so we have one more you guys are doing so great and i have a lot of stuff here i have a one two three scarf say it with me scarf scarf what about that f on the end scarf scarf scarf scarf okay i like this scarf it s a nice scarf i have a what is this sweater sweater or sweatshirt sweatshirt no sweater sweater sweater okay i think when it s what is this outside sunny say it with me sunny sunny it is sunny so i think you know what s interesting is this is the important word so so so i ll need sunglasses boys and girls when it gets really really sunny outside sometimes the sun hurts my eyes so i put on my sunglasses okay so i want you to try it now i want you to try it boys and girls now you all have in front of you two worksheets you have one worksheet in front of you you have two different ones many of you have this worksheet and many of you have this worksheet okay i just gonna do one quick sentence here because it is hot i ll need my sunglasses shirt someone raise their hand tina tina say that loud sunglasses sunglasses sunglasses and shorts oh i didn t tell you about my shorts i brought those today too say it with me shorts shorts say it with me shorts shorts okay so it s sunny and i m gonna need my shorts and sunglasses i got em i ll need my sunglasses and shorts and because here this is what you call a transition word this is what we re working on now if i have this here juan pablo you have this worksheet we have cause and effect if i have this here we have let s say since it is raining i ll need my raincoat and that s a coat for rain it s on your list there so what is this word here say it with me since since since is a transition word in speaking and then sometimes writing like this style of writing you would use these words all the time in speaking you show cause and effect since i don t have any money i can t buy anything to eat tonight because it s raining i think i ll go to the movies cause and effect boys and girls use it each and every time you think about speak about cause and effect now i want you to try this with your partner and then we re gonna practice speaking these out on three i want you to go three two one go use the examples use the sentences and here s some more additional examples for you do you see it up top clothing right here clothing how would you make clothes out of that can you see it give it a try can you read this to me what do you need when it s hot okay so you see the list right here which items are for hot which items are for cold can you try to write that for me i m gonna come back look at the charts they are there to help you you see the chart that i made so let s try something i want to try something can you read me actually read hon lu your first sentence and you read her your first sentence you first partner a partner b partner a go you first you re partner a because it is raining i need my umbrella and raincoat because it s hot i need my shorts okay now you re speaking to each other not to me okay keep going go since it is sunny i need my sunglasses can you write that there look right here that list for you okay you see on the look at the word slide through it two syllables is that one boot one boot or two so how is there yes yes boots great this is great stuff i m proud of you so proud of you read this you look like you haven t got started here so listen to him he did a really nice job here and let s work together okay can you read me your first sentence because it s hot so i need my sunglasses good now pause now listen i want you to try one so i need my i m sorry did you say the umbrella if it s hot i need an umbrella no if it s which one which one if i if it which one do i need an umbrella,0.0
in my classroom each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers where they also may store their art and they ve each made a back splash of art inspirational images in the corner of the room i have a resource area including images of art books and magazines a computer with an internet connection and examples i have a board where i give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance i have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations in the corner of the room there s acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron in front of that there s soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above and also eye protection and gloves the sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps in the corner of the room you see a fire extinguisher a buffing machine a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow and ear protection a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves an emergency eyewash station and shower and first aid kit in here we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation and in the front we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher this is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry now this isn t jewelry per se you know what these are coins coins there s such an interesting iconography of coins i love the patterning that happened when he cast them i mean i just think its you ve got the horse you ve got the man some sort of a symbol i don t really know what all the symbols are but you could really use a lot of this and do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up and here people have even made jewelry out of the coins and here art is an example of in north africa a lot of times women traditional women it s probably changing now but i don t really know how much it s changed or not changed this picture is from 1988 or something so it s in the past but they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry and they d wear it everyday and it might seem ridiculous to us you can do your farming you re going about your business cooking and you re wearing all that craziness but that way it s on them they have it if something happens to their husband nobody can take it away because it s on their body it s protected it s also very obvious if the husband were to steal the money and take it away they would know because she s not wearing it so he would be shamed so it s sort of it s like the dowry the money comes into the family from the woman s parents but it s also to help protect the woman it s not just it s not just to go to the husband so i think it s amusing that they re wearing it i thought they weren t allowed to wear makeup well it depends in what part of where you are i mean are you thinking who is they i m thinking iran and stuff and north africa right iran there s different sects of islam and what people believe as really strict is different in this north africa iran s more in the middle east getting closer i mean does it even even in asia it might even be asia no it s not in north africa it s not in africa so this is like north africa there s a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert it s all intermixed and people in southern africa like in sudan are predominantly islamic and they have a different take on it too so maybe in iran it s frowned upon as vanity but the muslim culture requires women to cover their faces it s not muslim religions that only it s arabian that s very good chloe very very astute it s there traditions it s not required by the religion it s a cultural thing that s good that s a good clarification i didn t think of it that way so also this redeemable investment or wealth people like to and they have people over for dinner golden silverware on the right that was the silverware of marie antoinette i ve never heard of gold silverware so gold i know they re eating on gold and it can t be 24 carat because it would be too soft but it s probably a gold alloy and there s also cases of people when times get tough melting down their silverware so they can have the yeah and you use that as your it s like people nowadays are investing in gold they re buying gold bars because it s like you own something you see it it s not just a piece of paper that says you own something yeah i think there s commercials about buying gold and this is a chalice through the church the church accumulated a lot of wealth specifically the catholic church during the medieval times and they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood okay attraction and beauty this is pretty obvious because where do people usually wear jewelry on their necks and faces and yeah yeah to draw attention i think to the face usually is a big deal and also this is an example of a cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman so a lot of times it s with the idea of love or commitment romantic love here we have indians from india and these are things that you can buy this is just off of that so this is like the traditional wedding where you ve got kind of an inexpensive version perhaps that you can buy there s all sorts there s all levels of expense that you can buy and here we are again with north africa just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn t beautiful i don t know how many of you have tattoos any of you have a tattoo i wish okay i mean you re a little bit young right do you think you might want a tattoo at some point yeah my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back really do you like it yeah it s really pretty but i wouldn t want something like that yeah i don t remember what it says something it has to do with swimming i think it s like swimming in some way it s a really good quote though yeah she looks like that girl from avatar you know i haven t seen avatar but as a movie designer james cameron what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie probably if you i mean does anybody like star wars that was a popular kind of thing but you know i always wanted the hair braids mom mom please she s like your hair isn t long enough that was a movie they had it was a wig i was like do it do it i braid my hair put beads in it sometimes there are cultures that wear their hair like that so it s like nothing is sort of new under the sun people are reinventing what s already happened i always wanted it just like pocahontas that s the entire story the second time i saw it i was like oh this is really bad one thing they represented it wrong that s like the reason they were there because it was very valuable oh so you re thinking it could have been a little more creative you know the first time you see it it s so good and then the second time you re like hey now that i ve seen this so it s good to critique pop culture to determine if you get a job in the movies how would you do it better or differently i d do a different plot i d be more creative okay yeah we better i m gonna keep moving on all right okay so here we have ancient egypt on the left and we have miss south carolina 2000 i can t remember 2004 2006 recently isn t it interesting how similar the eye the eyeliner the long eyebrow the hair coming down the crown you know i mean i think the eyebrows well she doesn t have the i m trying to create a bead kind of thing okay melting the stuff drew was using for his corset together oh the screen so you re melting the screen oh interesting so how will you use that in your i m thinking i can use it in attaching because i think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that not gold and shell ish okay okay well do you want to go look at your stuff or do you want to or you feel like you need to finish that oh no that s fine there appears to be no blue stuff oh the pickle it s new oh it only gets blue from the copper so it it does have pickle in it it s just fresh and new so you could you could see that little yogurt container you can put it in that and that has holes in it and then you can just kind of let that float just kind of put a little in there like tip it yeah that s good okay yeah let s go look at your oh should we look at those would you rather do those or okay let s go sorry we re going outside now okay oh wow what do you think i like them i really like them as not a shell color because they don t seem can i touch it sorry i touched it before i asked you i think once you like as i did just find the shell along the stream right you re transforming it i really like the shell of the spray paint too because it helps tie it in with the metal it makes well it s metallic spray paint so it seems really metal y yeah right cool and it makes it a little bit more blingy you know and i like how it reflects the light all the cracks and stuff yes it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it then this unifies them it makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people s clothes do you think about how would you how will you attach are you thinking of using these in one group or are they more pendants i think they re more like pendants and i was gonna poke a hole okay like two holes in them and i was gonna use a bunch of different strings together so it s kind of like and they re right there and maybe bead it a bunch of beaded strings so really this is like one necklace that s or is it many necklaces that people can layer it s just one necklace okay all right well let s can we go look at your sketch book too the other thing is next time it would be better i think to drill the hole first before you paint it okay because i m afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole i was going to just poke a hole with a needle can you do that i think so i mean they re really a lot more soft than metal oh okay well try it and see if it works but i have a diamond drill bit it can drill and that s what drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff okay and also most of these already have holes oh yeah because of the creature that eats the muscle yeah i love the hole that s already in there yeah okay all right let s go look at that these probably need to dry a little more yes okay okay let s go in there s only five more minutes on here okay that s good we ll get this and that ll be okay oh look at that see that s amazing to me because whenever i find coquinas i guess i find the live coquinas i ve never seen the shells like just the shells but they all have a hole this is a great find i got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach yes because they all lay next to each other in the sand and when you i mean now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry i m not sure yet because here i ll come over is this better like this yeah i could use like i could put them all together on one string on one necklace sort of like the coral but i don t know i don t think i have enough for that from reproduction well you have a lot what might be better right because you re right because then they would nest right if you just put with cubicle then they don t take up much space what if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one and that could put see how you have sort of charms on your chain you could these could also be sort of like charms hanging down and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring could have a little chain and it could hang down to vary the length or or you said that you like to use did you make your necklace that s woven there that s okay you but you know how to sew so could you sew them on something i could yeah i mean i have some leather strip and that would be keeping with natural materials so that might be interesting i don t know i well i think what you need to do is to experiment sew some do some metal through some and then maybe lay some out and you can see how chloe has hers laid out in that box so that she can keep it i think you d need a box or a tray and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them yeah now what are these those are oh and these are a dove s feathers they re so elegant yes now do you have your sketch book can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this here i think i got it here you go i could do this with the shell oh because that s hanging off and then what is this round ring part i m not sure it could just be like a round golden it could be a soldered ring of metal like brass wire soldered together is this an earring yes okay that may be for these right that was that s what i was planning to do with the shell for that i could do a bunch of different strings or i could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string or something right right asymmetry okay i like it and then this is the feather these are jump rings and this is the feather,0.0
okay guys yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned we studied we found definitions for those words were adaptation there s habitat and community okay adaptation is the first word who can tell me something about adaptation karina adaptation is how animals act like the howler monkeys they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger so they can survive okay so they can survive right adaptation helps them survive and then habitat who can tell me what habitat is ernesto where you live okay it s the environment where they live it s the surroundings okay it s the trees it s the plants it s the ground and it s the climate that they live in and the last one is community okay so if we re thinking about animals what makes up a community for these animals who can tell me sergio the community what makes up a community it s not the environment the animals it s all the animals do we have just one animal in the community we have many we have many it could be very many okay we re going to on and i d like you to listen to this sound shhhh just listen to this sound okay you may have and you can hear this sound at night okay what i d like you yo

know what the title is next i d like you to put your finger on the caption okay and can i have one person read the caption let s have karina read the caption owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark okay very good then we have underneath the title of the great horned owl we have what i call bullet points we talked a little bit about them and put your fingers on the bullet points there and let s have ernesto read those bullet points bird found in north central and south america live in the canopy and understory understory very good and we live in what continent eddie what continent do we live in north america north america so we ll find these and actually i will usually hear these at night and usually hear them kind of in the winter time all right let s have the first paragraph eddie why don t you continue the great horned owl has no ears but can hear anyway it can also see very good even on the darkest night okay and the second paragraph makayla an owl hunts for food at

partner or your neighbor now we re going to continue working in partners here and i m going to give you something to take a look at and i m going to have you guys just close your books for a second after you re done writing close your books okay i m going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks i want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick okay so take a close look at it all right and take a look at it and then i d like you to put down what you know about that stick okay there are yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also but what is something look at the ends of the stick and let s put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick okay just write it down or tell your neighbor tell your neighbor yeah he bit the stick on here but did he actually cut it was he able to bite it yes yeah he was he was okay all right now who can tell me what animal this might be karina a beaver it is a beaver and you will find these in this area what i would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver so let s write that down just skip this and go right to what do you want to know tell your neighbor go ahead and tell your neighbor about it what do you want to know okay tell your neighbor guys too once you have written it down how old can a beaver live okay how old can a beaver live that s good yea keelie what i want to know how about are they electric okay okay i want to know how long they are in their house maybe yes i want to know how big can they be okay good i have hair on here it s possible actually yeah that is very possible you have hair of a beaver i would actually i m going to hang onto that and actually let s put that in the garbage but that s good it s right here okay i ll take it okay yea you re going to find that probably we re not going to look at the sticks too much we need to find insects still living in the stick but we re going to leave that for right now i d like you to take a look at page twenty take a look at page twenty i do recommend that if you ever by chance go to deerbro there s a forest near the school here your parents can take you you might actually see a beaver house okay let s find out some more information about beaver on page twenty put your fingers on the title put your fingers on the title you know what i ll take that here we go and you know what let me recollect these because we have let me collect those back thank you there we go okay put your fingers on the beaver the title okay can i have one person read the bullet again bullet marks sergio go ahead mammal found in north america europe and asia lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor okay and can you name another mammal if you happen to know what the mammal might be can you name another mammal whale a whale is a mammal and we are also mammals okay the next paragraph i d like to have one person read that paragraph karina beavers eat bark twigs leaves and roots they have wide flat tails these tails help beavers to clear a placement beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur they also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur this oil helps keep them warm in the water okay before we go on as we re going to be looking at a lot of things think about what it is you re learning what s something new that you re learning about this beaver now before we go on everybody put your finger on the caption okay caption makayla what does the caption say a beaver s fur keeps it warm in the snow all right very good so let s take one more thing we re going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen so now let s go to page seventeen and this talks a little bit more about a beaver and the title let s put our finger on the title of page 17 what does the title say keelie graph section diagram okay we re looking at page 17 right here put your finger on the top of the diagram and that s the title what does it say keelie beaver lodge okay what is we know a beaver is the animal what s a lodge keelie their house where they live yea it s like their house okay next there s a caption built into the diagram and it s green let s have sergio read the caption there this beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor if it wouldn t float the lodge will have to be rebuilt okay very good let s get some more information there s some other things in the diagram to give us information makayla some lodges are two meters 6 5 high okay very good and keelie the lodge is made from logs and sticks okay and eddie the last one beavers come in and out under the water okay so this is where they live this is how they live and why do you think they build their house this way anybody what do you think they do why do they build it this way karina because when they when people come like hunters if they want to catch them it is going to be difficult for them okay like predators other predatory animals yeah so this is a way they adapt so how do they adapt to survive in their environment makayla to enter from the underground water okay can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence beavers beavers adapt to beavers adapt how yea karina beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water okay so they adapt in that way other predators can t see when they re coming and as we saw on the sticks the sticks they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this okay so what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again using the word habitat i d like you to tell me what s the habitat of a beaver they live in lodges they live in lodges okay what s around their lodge yeah karina sticks and wood okay sticks but then what is this blue stuff here water it s water yeah so they actually go underwater to get into their home and that makes it very safe so i would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer okay okay once you ve got one third okay and eddie when you ve got something why don t you tell your neighbor when you ve got something tell your neighbor what you learned like this okay actually right here yea what you ve learned okay and if you were to go out somewhere and you were in the woods what would you see what do you think you would see from this house this is all water so all you re going to see are you going to see the hole that s here no no what do you think you re going to see the sticks just like a stick just a mound of sticks about two meters high which is probably about that tall,0.0
in my opinion i think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself telling the principal i should not pay 15 00 because then it wouldn t be a scholarship okay thank you very much i like the way the way you show you know how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket thank you very much i agree with julia because you should not choose people for like what kind of races they are or their culture you should choose them for what they ve been through like their hardest work or something okay so you mean they had jobs they had work it was right to feel that very good good job okay i think martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it okay in my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise and a great leader is wise okay i agree with alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn t pay for the jacket he didn t pay for the jacket so you thought because he didn t pay for the jacket then he s a great leader you think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that s what made him a great leader no i think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying oh okay here s the money okay so a greater leader should stand for what he believes is that what you are saying yes very good thank you very much for clarifying that go ahead daniel i was going to say that i agree with jennifer i think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe thank you very much go ahead in my opinion i think martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight as and being a good student all right thank you go ahead lisette in my opinion martha s grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like martha s grandpa very good so you need to stand your ground very good i think that the person who showed the most leadership was martha even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned she believed that even though the teachers they they some wanted to give it to someone else but some knew that she had earned it and she she spoke up not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself okay so you feel a great leader you know she speak up you know when something is wrong or in the way she shouldn t just keep it very good she has to tell someone very good good job go ahead it seems to me that martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket okay what are some of the other things you know that martha did she got she got since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble and be a good student okay so that means you know she has worked hard all this time very good thank you okay go ahead i believe that martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn t give up on trying to get it so a good leader you know she ll try to do whatever it takes you know to get what he or she wants is that what you re saying yes all right good job thank you in my opinion i think mr schmidt is a great leader because he was fair you know to fight for martha and not the other girl thank you who is the other girl joanne huh joanne okay so mr schmidt was fair enough you know to fight for martha instead of who joanne joanne thank you very much in my opinion it s martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best all right in my opinion i think mr smith because even though martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades because of her good grades good job in my opinion i believe that the one that showed leadership was mr smith because he was honest and fair to martha very very good thank you very much i agree with her because mr booney just wanted the person that had money which is joanne her father owned the only store in town so mr schmidt was actually being fair okay thank you for adding on to that now who is joanne s dad you know because everybody was saying i could hear juan you know when juan said because of joanne s dad who is joanne s dad how can we describe him he owns the only store in town hmm he owns the only store in town he owns the only store in town what else he s also part of the school board he s rich school board huh he s part of the school board so they had the decisions like in the school like what they do and stuff in the story he gives money to the school so maybe that s also why they wanted to pick joanne so they got more money very good thank you very much now that everybody has contributed now let s look at the next question the next question is this what does martha represent to you think about the leadership qualities that martha showed what does martha represent to you not only the leadership qualities all the other things that martha represents okay anybody can start anybody can start just jump in i believe that martha to me represents a great leader her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up thank you for sharing that she represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it she stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say very good it seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly great like that anybody can jump in it seems to me that martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket i disagree because martha did speak up for herself her grandfather just told her what to say i disagree because like her grandfather gave her most of her ideas if it wasn t for her grandfather she probably would ve tried to get the money but like her father said i mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it i agree with daniel because like well yeah i agree with arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn t have to pay for it instead of martha going to speak to the principal in person i disagree with that i disagree with that i disagree i disagree with daniel and javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say her grandpa didn t go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say i agree with myra because it s true i mean he didn t go martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said so that s why i say that martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather the grandfather might ve said that but she was the one that stood there and said it that took a lot of courage to me okay so you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough so i like what arkie said arkie said you know i disagree that martha was a leader and arkie open up that thank you very much archimedes thank you all of you for sharing that any other person to me martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble okay she worked really hard thank you any other person that wanted to add something it seems to me that martha is a that proves that it doesn t matter her race or color she could do anything the same as anybody else can do wow i agree with ashley because a lot of people discriminate like mexican people or like mexican americans just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they re not from the united states so you know what has martha done to straighten that or to disprove that she showed that who cares where you re from or who you are you can always do your best okay so you know there was martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing if we really work hard we know that it will work is that what i m hearing from all of you yes that it doesn t matter what race you know if you work really hard you know that you can achieve thank you very much for sharing that i really admire her because i know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it s somewhat sad because some people aren t allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they re from what i think is that it doesn t matter what you are no one is bad except for the person who s making fun of your race you are not the bad one it s the person who s making fun of you thank you very much any other person that wants to add something to this i agree because in a poem it says you can t persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them like persuade them thank you very much now let s go on to the last question thank you very much for sharing i could hear from all of you the last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with scholarship jacket think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations okay so think of that what other stories have you read okay anyone can start i think crossing the wire is somewhat similar because pablo was mexican too and they mistreated him and denied him a job however he worked as hard as martha thank you for sharing that you call that crossing what crossing the wire crossing the wire thank you i think the story of martin luther king is pretty similar to the scholarship jacket because they discriminated a lot against african americans because of their color but martin luther king stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we re different we re all the same just because of color doesn t separate us thank you very much for sharing that i agree with jennifer martin luther king said that it doesn t matter where you re from or who you are everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers thank you very much for sharing that i have seem the movie the blind side which is pretty similar to the story michael shows great leadership because he is an african american and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a catholic school to play football thank you i agree with carlos i ve also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely michael i agree with carlos because in that movie michael from the beginning he didn t want to go to school he actually had really low grades and the family he had they re from another race and even though he had really low scores they got him a tutor and they helped him like reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play wow thanks again i have read the outsiders which is a story about two classes of people the greasers and the soches the greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class okay at the end what happened did they succeed like martha did they achieve some of them died some of them died okay,0.0
yeah why don t we list that up here okay here is what you re going to do go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick put those pencils away in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and just to make sure you haven t now you have identified you have taken this work of art you ve seen what it is and you ve taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used now we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements what kind of thought feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements with this subject so who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found what s one shapes shapes what s another one color color shape lines value value texture you guys with those elements they re telling you something so here s what we re going to we re going to put on our thinking pairing and sharing hats so whatever i do that so you guys can pair and share together will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference thank you all right first question ready the first question is how does this man feel now think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel no talking think to yourself think shh you ve got to tell me why too don t just think about feeling tell me why two people look like they re pairing already don t pair yet now tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking is feeling is feeling all right now we re ready to share with the whole group so i m going to start with right here with jermaine s group and we re going to go around and each person is going to get a turn or each pair is going to get a turn so first what was your group thinking how did he feel sad why because the color blue is a sad color and he looked down so he had two reasons he had the body position because he s kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten good job he said that sad and the color blue go together what do you guys think how does he feel i think he feels happy he s smiling and he s playing the guitar okay because he s creating music maybe that s what makes him happy i heard miss webster had a disagreement when they were pairing miss webster what is your take what do you think he s feeling tell me what you think he is sit up tell me what you think he is i think he s sad because okay because why he looks what say it again honey don t be embarrassed it s okay to have a different opinion i think he is lonely because he doesn t have any friends there s nobody else in that picture he is by himself in the picture maybe he s lonely we don t know okay so we had a difference of opinion that s okay next pair i think he s sad because he s looking down if he was happy he d be whoa wait a minute she just said this man doesn t have anything to eat why do you think he doesn t have any because his shirt is torn he don t have no pants and he don t have no socks so you re telling me he looks what is he rich or is he poor no he s poor okay that is very good insight on not only the details but also just what those details are telling us okay do you have something else to add what would you say i said i think he was happy to sit alone i think he s happy because he just okay so you think the guitar looks even though his clothing looks torn his guitar looks nice right maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes maybe not last pair tell me what you think he s feeling i think he s one at a time i think he s it looks like he s playing a sad song he s playing a sad song and he s playing why do you think it looks like he s playing a sad song because he s bowing his head down and his face don t look very happy okay you guys next question i can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat did you have something different than that okay go ahead i think he s sad because he looks like he s homeless oh maybe he s homeless now why do you think he s homeless because his shirt s torn on the side are there any other clues besides his clothing we already had miss marshall tell us about his clothing what other clues do we have that makes us think he s homeless without talking and making noise jermaine do you have a clue why he might be homeless why because he s outside by his self he looks like me might be outside this might be a step that he s sitting on next question next question what do you think the artist is trying to tell us what is the important message put your hands down think what is the message why is the artist painting this picture of this man i have one person she s got herself in the thinking posture she s thinking think please think think think i ve got a good thinker at this table i hope you re thinking honey okay now pair up ready pair and share with your table mate get paired up thirty more seconds to share i hear some good talking so i m giving you 30 more seconds why don t you share this time because you shared last time okay so you re going to share this time let s see you sitting up nice and tall we re going to share with the entire group we all learn from each other you guys we re going to start with the opposite way i m going to go this way can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us by painting this picture i m sorry just a second could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve you guys when you re listening to what he s saying he s trying to tell you what he thinks what his table mate thinks so you need to turn your body make eye contact and really listen to what he s saying okay okay go again i think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he s homeless he doesn t have any money he doesn t have any value okay when you mean value do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean like he seems very sad okay so you re talking about the color right okay next group i think that the artist is trying to persuade him wait a minute say that word again he s trying to what persuade persuade us what persuade us to think what persuade us he feels real mad or trying to do music or something okay is that what your team came up with you came up with something different than your team you had a disagreement right i think that i was not do you think the artist wants you to be like him no what do you think the artist wants you to learn from him he won t have nothing to work you can have a better life right okay this group could you put your feet down it s your turn you re going to share with us what your team came up with you can share come on you can talk to us remember that there s no wrong answer it s just what you think,0.0
so just leave your clicker on your table guys i mean you can put one in front of you just don t turn it on yet they re not activated please don t play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day thank you for the help excellent thanks all right guys so let s get started with our discussion here set the clicker down please don t play with it just leave it on the table thank you i asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question danny devito is between 4 9 and 5 1 tall so i m 5 10 so danny devito is either between this tall or about this tall we re not sure on his height his wife rhea perlman is 5 0 tall how tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why all right so please raise your hand to share your answer and i m going to ask you why you think like you do so i m going to start back there with alex so turn this way so that i can hear you okay okay i think their kids would be around 5 because their mom is 5 tall and their dad his middle height is 5 okay so you re looking at the middle estimated height of danny devito and his wife s height is 5 so you think together then all their children will be 5 boys and girls mm hm okay great thank you what else do you think j r i said 5 too i said 5 as well because that s about how tall they are so their kid would be around that okay so you re looking at kind of his average height and her height so you think the kids will be around that okay anything different or you want to explain it further michael i just said that you get your height from your parents so whatever the parents were right around 5 the kids will be about 5 okay you get your height from your parents so since the parents are about 5 the kids will be 5 boys and girls yeah okay great what do you think well i think the daughter could be 4 9 and the sons would be around 5 2 because both of the parents are shorter and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents okay so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents and you said that the daughters could be about 4 9 and the sons might be about 5 2 yes is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls it s just kind of a normal thing normally boys are taller than girls okay so a normal thing boys are usually taller than girls okay great any other ideas on the height of their children adam what do you think well what do you think about i think that they ll be around i think boys and girls will both be around 5 because it s right inbetween the parents okay good what about me and my family i m 5 10 so i m tall what do you think about my family members how tall do you think they are i m 5 10 how tall do you think my mom is how tall do you think my dad is what s your estimation what do you think raise your hands everybody let s participate mackenzie what do you think i think your dad would be around 6 2 and i think your mom would be around 5 11 or 5 9 okay so my mom is between 5 9 and 5 11 so close to my height and my dad would be taller about 6 2 brian what do you think i said that i think your dad would be taller than you but then your mom would be around the same height so my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller yeah anybody think anything pardon me or like around 6 my dad would be around 6 yeah what if i tell you my little brother my little baby brother is 6 4 and he is this is true he is 6 4 so he s a tall guy does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents you guys are nodding yes what do you think now travis maybe your dad is like 6 4 and your mom is like 5 8 or 5 9 or something okay so mom is about here dad is taller or 6 4 like my little brother michael what do you think both of them are about 6 both of them are about 6 okay great what do you think well i know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad from dads so that your dad is taller around 6 5 and then your mom is shorter like 5 8 so you see my height and my mom is about 5 8 and my dad is 6 5 so for my brother and i you re figuring about our traits what do you mean that you get your traits from your dad so my dad s genes are coming through why do you think that why do you think i have only traits from my dad because i know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom so more traits from dad than from mom do you think that s pretty much general yeah okay great do you guys have anything to comment on that what do you think i think your dad s probably like 6 2 because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they re still in high school oh interesting well i ll tell you my mom was 5 11 at her tallest now she s shrinking she s like 5 9 you know how that happens as you get older and my dad he s only 6 tall so my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother he s 6 1 so height does come from both sides but my dad s not as tall you guy s might ve thought let s talk about danny devito again here he is our favorite actor right notice his lack of hair he s bald the question on here says danny devito is bald what do you think his son s hair or lack of will look like when he s older and why his son danny devitto has a son what do you think about his hair nice and loud so i can hear you matthew it said that their son would have bald hair on the top but some on the sides some will be bald on the top but he ll have some hair around the sides why do you think that because usually if somebody s dad s bald they re not always bald if somebody s dad is bald they are not always bald i ve seen that you ve seen that that s a good observation matt what do you think well the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald so i thought he will still have a lot more hair than his dad he wouldn t be completely bald but bald on top okay so mom has a lot of hair dad s bald so you think the son will have hair but just bald on top yeah so when you see the traits being passed down how do you see it i m not really sure what you mean by that question you re kind of saying that he ll have this trait but he ll also have this trait so how do you see that happening did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another the son or do you think i think they were combined they were combined the traits are combined good sean i thought he would have like a blackish brown hair because that s what the mom s hair color is okay he probably wouldn t be bald but he d have a receding hairline okay so he would have a receding hairline and for those of us that don t know what that means that means when a person starts to lose their hair and it kind of inches back and they re losing their hair that s what a receding hairline is so the hair falls out as it moves back are you ready to see what danny devito s kids look like here they are for our predictions we have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family he s about 5 5 so he s taller than both mom and dad this is danny devito s wife danny devito and his son here s his daughters this daughter is about the height of the mom but she has big shoes on the other daughter is taller but notice their hair what do you notice about their hair ryan tell me what you notice about all three kids well they all have hair they re not bald they all have hair they re not bald how would you describe their hair curly curly hair what color black black or dark brown yes very good all right so we see that now when we think about these bunnies another question i asked you is this look at the picture if they had ten offspring what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like the fur in what respect that was the question nathan what do you think 25 would be white 25 would be black the remainder would be gray with a little white so part of them will be black and part of them will be white so half of them will be gray okay so here s what we have i m going to use abbreviations and 50 will be gray nathan says that because one parent is white one s black they ll combine to form a gray color just like mixing paint in art class any other predictions what else are you thinking let s hear from somebody new what else do you think omar i think 40 of the bunnies are going to be black are going to be half black and half white like a black bunny with white dots or a white bunny with black dots all right so you re saying 40 black 40 white you will see both colors we ll see black and we ll see white why did you choose 40 40 and 20 because i think that it s rare for bunnies to have dots it might be rare for them to have dots okay so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely the probability is higher for a solid color so that s why you chose 20 great great thinking great explanation sean what do you think i had 20 white and the rest are gray i would have said 25 but you can t have two and a half babies being white okay all right so you would ve said 25 so you were thinking similarly yeah why do you say 20 20 and 60 because most of them would be a mixture of the two but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit s traits okay so because they have offspring the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits so mom and dad will blend together to create gray but some of them will look just like the father some will look just like the mother so some will be black some will be white great one more idea kasey what do you think i know in health that everyone has a dominant feature i think white is so that the majority so like 40 would be white and 20 would be black and then the rest would be gray 40 white 20 black and 20 gray and you said because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe that s only 80 oh what did you say for the last one i said the rest wow well thanks for paying attention good check there guys it would be 40 60 we need 40 did you say 40 i said the rest i was just making up too many different numbers well i m so happy that you guys are paying attention i m going to tell your math teacher good job okay 40 white but here s what kasey said that was really good she said that 40 will be white because white is dominant you used that word you talked about that in health a little bit so let s talk about dominant and what that means what does it mean what do you think dominant means and be nice and loud for us john most of most of good what do you think sam main main sean the majority the majority alex beat out all others beat out all others nice what do you think sean strongest okay let me show you a little example here so where do we get our traits first of all where do we get traits from parents from where parents your parents okay it s passed down traits are passed down and some come from each parent right dominant recessive some come from both mom and dad if you received a dominant trait see i labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait so half and half mom and dad they come together which trait do you see the dominant one or the recessive one the dominant one the dominant one what if i put it this way which trait do you see the dominant one what if i put two recessive traits together the recessive the recessive okay either way i pair them mom or dad dad or mom if i have two dominant traits that go together what do i see dominant dominant okay so if the dominant trait is present then finish the sentence if the dominant trait is present in your genes then what it will show it will show kasey says that s right if the dominant trait is present it will show are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro okay let s check this then real quick yesterday you filled out this concept map let s make sure that your answers are correct jsut take a look so read this with me genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits from parent to offspring and if the offspring has the same alleles we call that purebred and if they have different alleles hybrid what that means allele that word say that allele allele it s the fun word to say during our genetics unit that s the form of the gene so is it a dominant or is it a recessive okay so let s go back here genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits i don t hear everybody controlled by genes made of alleles say it again alleles alleles so genes made of alleles shows when present we call that dominant and can be masked recessive recessive all right very good any questions on the concept map any corrections if you need to make them please do so all right well let s get going with our lab are you guys ready okay please take out your lab paper we re going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on notice the top of the paper it says problem this is what we re trying to solve this is the point of our scientific investigation are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles i d like you on the lines to create your own hypothesis or your prediction for this are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common that s the question are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles so write down what you think write down your prediction if you can write it in the if then format of how we do hypotheses that s preferred but if that confuses you at this point just write what you think is going to happen are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles whatever you think it s your thinking we will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment so once you ve written down your hypothesis reread it and make sure that it answers the question then we re going to get to work using our clickers which i ll explain in just a moment i d like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin the question again are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles please share your prediction your hypothesis ronnie i said yes because dominant alleles it shows over recessive alleles so you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles okay great girls one of you share your hypothesis for me who would like to share everyones looking at you kate what do you have on your paper i said that i thought the dominant alleles were more common you believe the dominant alleles will be more common okay great thank you another one alex i agreed with it i said that i believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive because there s more combinations to get dominant one s over recessive you believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive because there s more combinations to get that to get to that to get the dominant traits to show good one more matthew i said that the dominant traits are less common because in the picture with danny devito his son and daughters didn t look much like him okay so you believe that the dominant traits are less common because in the example of danny devito his kids didn t look much like him yeah and how your younger brother is 6 4 and how my younger brother is 6 4 but he s taller than the rest of my family okay so you re making connections to our earlier conversation good we re going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab,0.0
let s talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company let s start with t shirts r us okay who can explain to me what s going on with t shirts r us devon you have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt okay so you ve got to pay and then what do you pay per shirt six six dollars per shirt okay what are the advantages of that how is this one in some way better than top of the line allegra what s better about this company you only have to pay six dollars per shirt you only have to pay six dollars per shirt so you re telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt right okay what s the disadvantage to this plan who can tell me the disadvantage to this one sarah you have to pay 50 dollars first you have to pay 50 dollars up front okay so if i were going to buy a lot of shirts let s say i was going to buy 200 shirts which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts taylor i think the t shirts r us would be better because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt yeah for this one the more shirts you buy the better deal it becomes right but for this one if you re not going to buy if we were only going to buy for say 10 people would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference probably not okay so for top of the line tees our initial charge the nice thing about top of the line what s the advantage of top of the line they re eight dollars that it raise you hand kevin they re only eight dollars they re already eight dollars but is that their advantage yes no patrick says no patrick is their advantage that they re eight dollars per shirt what s the advantage for top of the line isn t it because the design is free is free so do we have to pay anything up front no no so if cameron if you and i were the only people that wanted to get shirts that would probably be a good place to go right because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars but up here two shirts is going to be expensive right right yeah yeah it would be over 60 dollars right 62 that s not a very good price for shirts okay brett i kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn t really part of the data okay another thing i kind of thought whenever i was working on this last night was if they re charging money for the graphic couldn t it possibly be like a better graphic but it could be it doesn t necessarily mean that it is and i think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable maybe not identical but at least close okay all right so let s look at a couple of different things okay let s start with these tables you guys have had a minute to look at these tables what the first question says which of the following tables represents t shirts r us with this being our given information which one of these tables is t shirts r us tell me how you know amanda the first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts okay so amanda says that this one is t shirts r us and how did you know that you explained that in a really interesting way how did you say that because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts yeah amanda says this one has to be t shirts r us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars yes okay that s one way to say it is there another way lindsay you had something interesting on your paper what s the other way that we can tell whether or not that s t shirts r us i divided 30 divided by five equals six can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five in t shirts there were a five dollar difference the t shirts goes up by five yeah so this one goes up and the cost up by 30 and i just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars so she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five so then to figure out how much each shirt was she divided the 30 by six and figured out oh no not by six 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt so one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change right and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost like what is it that you have to pay up front so in this problem can we see both can we look at this table and see here s what you have to pay up front and then here s what you have to pay per shirt can you see that yes okay write that down all right so look at the table and let s talk about the original question that we asked the original question that i asked you and this was just a pick which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students t shirts r us what did you find out when you really really investigated casey they re both 200 each you really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost 200 dollars 200 dollars so if we were just buying t shirts for our class would it matter which company we chose no no what if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100 bree what do you think if we were going to buy t shirts for all 100 students because at 25 the cost is the same right which one of these is going up more quickly the one on the left the one on the left s going up more quickly what do you think nahla says she disagrees nahla the one on the right is going up more quickly because it s going up by 40 yeah this one s going up how much every five shirts 40 yeah this one s going up 40 and at that same time this one s only going up 30 30 right bree so bree which one s going up faster the right one yeah so they re the same here do you guys see they re the same here you see that bree but if this one s going up faster if i m going to buy a whole if i m going to buy a lot more shirts what s going to eventually happen with this one it will increase it s going to get increasingly more expensive okay so somebody summarize this for me what did we just figure out about tables what did we just explain about tables what can you find on tables sierra tell me what we can find by looking at a table y intercept we can definitely find the y intercept can you tell me how we can find the y intercept when the x value is zero when the x value is zero that s going to be our y intercept that was an excellent explanation guys what else can we find from the graph we can find the y intercept what else can we find samantha we can find the slope we can find the slope and can you summarize how we found the slope we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run yeah we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run excellent job okay so that s tables cameron question is it okay on the table where it says like t shirts in the columns is it okay to put x and y over them cameron if that helps you understand it then yes that s completely fine but you need to understand that x and y represent something right it s okay for you to think about it as x and y but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t shirts and y represents cost okay that s a good question all right now let s look at the graph okay suppose these two graphs were given to you okay look at the graph is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph s set up does the scale set look the same yeah the x axis is identical and the y axis is identical so let s talk about the graph for a second look at the graph adam can you look at that graph and tell me which thing which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line the one on the right the one on the right can you tell me why because top of the line keep in mind the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt how did you pick this one to be top of the line because it started at zero okay so one of the things that s important was that you realized it started at zero so he looked at this and recognized that my he said starts at zero okay that s important how else could we figure out that that was how else could we figure that out allegra i said that since it was five times eight well that s the first coordinate it would be oh okay so the first coordinate was five 40 so you said five times eight is 40 40 okay what about this one that is 80 10 times eight is 80 okay is that an interesting way of thinking about it yes and does that also work does that make sense with this problem starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars so she said five times eight 10 times eight and that pattern would work all the way up is there other ways that i could identify that this is top of the line amanda i went down there on the table that the rate of the pulse goes up faster uh huh so like when you said how did you guys here the word she used to describe that she said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate do you guys agree with that the line s more steep yeah the line has greater steepness is the word you used steep right yeah so this one not only does it start at zero so we can recognize it that way but we also recognize that it s going up more quickly this one s going up eight dollars each shirt and this one s only going up six dollars each shirt because let s look at the rate of change for this one if we went from zero to five that went over five right and then from 50 up to 80 is what 30 that s from 50 to 80 is 30 30 and so 30 over five gives me how much six six per shirt okay nahla you had your hand up yeah go ahead i was gonna say that i understand that it started at 50 so that would be t shirts r us so if that was t shirts r us then the other one had to be top of the line guys did you hear what nahla said nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50 so because that one started at 50 it had to be what t shirts r us t shirts r us okay so so what re we talking about we re talking about looking at a graph and finding two things what are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph greg tell me one slope we need to do our final slope emanuel tell me the other one the y we need to be able to find the slope and the y intercept okay emanuel can you summarize for me how to find the y intercept how do you look at a graph and find the y intercept where the line crosses the y axis where the line crosses the y axis so sierra told us when we re on our table we re looking for where the x is zero the x is zero but on the graph that means that it crosses the y axis okay nice can somebody tell me from a graph how to find slope stella i haven t heard from you for a minute how do we find slope from a graph you use the slope triangle you use the slope triangle uh huh then it leads your eyes for example can we talk about this one it doesn t matter you pick whichever one you d like so it will be the rise and speed it s going up yeah so this is our rise okay and the run is how far it s going out and the run is how far it s going out it s rise over run and then you write it as a ratio rise to run okay excellent guys i have one final question on the graph so we picked these we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right and for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six right would it matter if i did went too far i think would it matter if i did that no i heard no can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that s no so why does it not matter sydney because it s the same shape it s just larger it s a similar figure so i guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it it would be the same did you guys hear what sydney said sydney used the word similar or used the phrase similar figures what do similar figures mean what does that mean greg like two figures that have the like they re they don t exactly have to be the same size it s like basically a dilation of the other it s essentially a dilation okay so the first one we did went up 30 over five right well what about the red one the red one went from five to 20 how much did it go over if it went from five to 20 cameron 15 it went over 15 so if this one goes over 15 you sort of used that word dilation right what s the scale factor from five to 15 positive 3 that s times by positive 3 right so likewise what should this be if my run was 15 what should my rise be raise your hand if you know jaylynn 90 it should be 90 okay so let s check and see if it is so we went from five so that went 15 and then we went from 80 up to 170 now what s the difference from 80 to 170 80 to what 80 to 170 i don t know that s okay what s the difference who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170 sierra 90 the difference is 90 so if i looked at those two ratios so if i looked at those two ratios one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five are those equal yep yes that is let s check it are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt yes yeah so how do we find slope from a graph taylor said we make the slope triangle and does it matter which triangle you pick nope no because they should be proportional they should be dilations of one another okay it be a good reference to something that we learned can you show us how to start out like the first one or the first few pages so the question was do you have to start out at the first one no sydney why no because if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars then you don t have to unlike the other one it started at zero mm hm are you talking about the final slope nahla yes okay nahla you can start at the first point but you don t have to because if it s linear should the pattern ever change no so if the pattern never changes does it matter which two points you pick no any two exact points you pick should still give you the same rate of change that was a great question okay all right so now this is a different one so on the last one i gave you the verbal right i did i said t shirts r us and gave you the verbal expression this time i m not giving you that this time we ve got a third t shirt company the third t shirt company tee time they explain to us this is their function cost cost is equal to 4 50x plus 25 my question is what does that mean who can tell me what it means to do 4 5x plus 25 samantha start me we would charge and 4 50 per each t shirt okay so what do we have to pay no matter what patrick what is the one thing we have to pay if we ordered a shirt what s the one thing they re going to charge us for the design they re going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design right but then each time huh each time well that s a great question do they charge us 25 dollars every time that s a great great great great great question no why not what s the 25 dollars for it s for the design on every shirt it s for the design and that is the design that we re going to use for all of our shirts so that s an important question does the y intercept explain anything about change will the y intercept change will it move up or down no the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is okay that was a great question who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like what would the graph look like it looks like a zero but i think it d start at 25 here it would start at 25 so it s go to start somewhere right in here okay and i m not sure why those numbers are on the table but they shouldn t be there okay but that s okay we can move forward from it we can do this what should the cost be initially 25 the cost should initially be 25 dollars okay then if we buy five shirts how can we figure that out who can tell me how to figure that out ah you can plug in the value of five in the equation thing you can plug into the equation ooh i know what we can use oh we can use i heard somebody say this earlier we can use a calculator right where would i put this information in the calculator y equals i d go to y equals excellent okay and i put it in there my function right so i ve got 4 50x plus 25 and then you press second yeah what am i trying to look at i m trying to look at my table let s go back for just a second look at the table that s already given to us what do they do in their table it increases by five they increase their x values by five so do i want to set mine up to go by fives yes yeah so how do didn t i how do i set up a table where do i do that it s a second and it s on top of a window yeah it s second and it s on top of a window we ve got a table set up where do we want to start our table what s the first number we need five okay because we already know zero right and then how much do we want to increase each time five we want to increase each time by fives okay are we okay with that now where do i go to actually have the calculator give me the information sydney where do i go you press second and then you press the graph button second graph which will give me the table so i will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected because i m going to need you to help me with mine i don t know why i put the wrong table up there okay we good all right so we used the calculator to help us get our table what was it in fives who can help me with this help me with this cameron real quick 47 5 that s 47 5 or 47 50 right what about tens 70,0.0
okay so if you re having trouble seeing it you can go back in with a regular pencil brush visible enough for you you can go back in and make it lighter but right now the mark makings you re doing is really good as you want to turn if you re having trouble making curved lines you can turn oh okay all right that helps instead of turning the tool turn the plate and keep pulling towards you okay it might make it a little bit easier to make those curves yeah they re really tough to do other than that it s been fine good is that working now that you what we talked about yesterday with this little yeah shadow i thought it was kind of okay and the same thing that i just told kim if you re having trouble with the curved lines you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve all right but so far what you re doing is good you re adding all these different values continue with that type of texture on the edges because that s working i m just going that s okay be patient have you decided yet how you re gonna treat this area in here no i m probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing okay so adding a different texture are you leaving the text i never i forgot to reprint it so if i do decide you ll just have to reverse the text yeah i know and i ll right add it in that s fine i think i ll just decide it later yeah finish your whole overall design first yes exactly and then if you want the text in it as long as it s reversed so you print it the right way yeah you can just reprint it okay sounds good awesome yeah so you re just yeah all right the way you re doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it s consistent do i have to make it identical no well what do you think are these identical persons it s like supposed to be but i know i m not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but i think it would look fine if it was different i kinda want it to look a little messy you want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one i don t think there s anything wrong with making them separate i know that they re trying to be echoing each other symmetrically yeah but all of the textures can be different okay to add some interest to it i think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side right don t you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway yeah definitely that s good how did you decide that you re going to treat the inside of the mouth area are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light well there s supposed to be some tongue over here but over here i m gonna make it like i m gonna try to go solid black in some parts like i tried to do that inside the mouth yeah that s good that s good i want mine to seem so then all of those areas then will stay dark yeah it ll create a nice shadow excellent that s really good are you gonna go off the edge yeah nice that s really good keep it up and emily how s yours coming yeah the same thing all those little dark areas that you re working on inside in between teeth now that you ve carved out all that area it s gonna create a darkened tone and as i mentioned before all the different stippling areas that s really good it s adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure if you re finding that it s easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table okay good good this is good i m getting confused of where i m going because if i did the backgrounds this is the negative space that i do the crosshatching then it would have to continue down here so you want to decide all the different types of textures that you re using in between all of it yeah all right so you ve got a little bit of the crosshatching here okay and you re using illustrative lines over here so you wanna try and find something in between that s a little bit different right uh huh well you haven t done any stippling texture yet i was working on in here okay so in here s gonna be stippling so right then this can t be the stippling because it s gonna be next to it i was thinking of here kind of moving this pattern down and then maybe just sort of okay i think that would be a good solution to that it s like this area in the background okay now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid and then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture you can go back into it and add it again okay okay so in here like you said follow the movement of these objects okay this is all the chain inside the bike so following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture and then in here just because you have all this texture in here you might not need to put anything else there okay what s your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra yeah it s hard to tell because i m not sure how it s gonna look when it s printed but i think that might be good because it would get kind of crazy i think it might be nice to have and you wanna still have it have a focal point so if you go crazy with other textures in here you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work okay i m having a hard time seeing it so you i might need to get one of those blue sheets okay the blue sheets are working i think you know what emily s been using the table so maybe that helps her to see her white lines that has been helping so if you don t wanna use one of those blue sheets you can do what she s doing and use the table yeah i ll do that i think i wanna lift it off of the book so you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines okay okay you re still working on your design right yeah i think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon yeah because once you figure out what s going on over here yeah i just have to yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong so what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas are you gonna fill them in too yeah i think so okay then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it engraving it i don t know i don t know if i should do really fine crosshatching mm hmm but then should i put a new texture on these what do you think do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print because i think if i texture both of them it ll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture okay so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first you can decide if they re too solid then you can go back in with a different texture okay okay so finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later okay room 221 students enter through a small entryway to their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom this classroom is shared by two teachers storage space is limited in this room i teach three sections of photography advanced placement studio art and advanced placement art history as we open up into the main part of the classroom storage areas are visible for each class photographic prints a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives as i pan the room you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible bulletin boards are set up for project instructions visual examples and critique displays along the back of the room is a dry mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies in the center of the room the printing press is stored for ap studio art and set up to allow for safe and organized used along the right hand side of the room there is a drawing rack for students to store work in progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives there is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents the file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders the large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies and at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept and at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use the projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions some of you are ready to print so i wanted to go through the actual printing press process today some of you might even be ready to try that today if you re not ready to try it right after i do the demonstration you can go back to your etching or engraving and then by tomorrow you ll be able to run it through the press before i do that i wanted to share something with you that s a little exciting and the fact that i actually have a relative who was a professional engraver my grandfather was an engraver he started in the 1930s and 40s after world war ii he was part of something called the gi bill does anybody know what that is oh i do yeah what is it they pay people to go to college yes exactly yeah after the world war ii veterans came back from war the government paid for them to go to college and he went to a college called the art students league which i was just talking with alex about and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver i m going to pass some of these around these are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you you can take some of those so you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time a hundred years at least or even more but this is from the early 30s and 40s these engravings and these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that i explained that we don t do here because of the safety you re doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid so i m going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that i m passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we re working with today and it s kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this so i m going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him all right so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print making ink so for the most part we re going to start with black today but you can choose any color that you want so you can see some of the examples that i put up here from past students one student decided instead of putting black ink on the white ground he used white ink on black ground so that s another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process so all the steps that we re going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week it s going to remind you of all the steps so the first step after you ve beveled all the edges in your plate that i demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print making ink and all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you re ready you ll take a little bit of print making ink and put it on the plate like this just like that and you ll use a tool called a brayer and the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate so once your brayer is filled with the ink you ll apply it to the plate and i m actually using my grandfather s plate from several years ago all right so you ll gently apply the ink over the entire plate okay just take a seat and i ll hand it out all right and after you have the entire plate inked you ll check and make sure that you didn t miss any spots all right notice that i missed a spot there so i m going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered once you have all the areas covered and this is just in interest of time i ll just show you the next step once the entire plate is covered you ll take a small piece of mat board i ll just use this instead okay i have little pieces of mat boards for you okay so you re going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that i have cut up here after you apply the entire ground with ink you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that s going to be on your inside lines this has a dual purpose it removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate this has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you re done this will push all the ink in the surface okay and then once you get most of it removed then you can take the cheesecloth i found one of my mat boards here we go all right so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink and then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front this will lift the ink off pretty easily and after you do this process this is the messy process so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you re done with this before we move to the printing press i ll show you how to do that sometimes a circular motion with this will help so i m going to show so you can all see circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface i m showing you this quickly all the steps but i have one prepared for us to print with just like a cooking show so it s ready to go all right so you re going to use flat on the table i m showing you this so you can see it but you re going to do all of this flat at your desk get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth if you run out of space you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again then the last step before you clean your edges at this point if you want to go clean your hands so you don t get it on anything again you could go clean your hands as well we ll take a piece of newsprint a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper the newsprint works the best so i have cut up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice smooth surface and before you re ready to print you could take a q tip dip it in some water and then clean your edges so the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates you should take the q tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean so this print was left up here for a reason it doesn t have a clean edge i wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn t clean their edge okay this has a nice clean edge this has a little bit of ink left on the edge so when you pull a perfect print you want to make sure you have a clean edge and the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off,0.0
let s go okay continue yes all right scholars here s my question what do you think actually let me start by quoting the passage so it says they can either trust or predict what chacko s attitude would be and they were trying to hide that get rid of it all before chacko returned so what do you think chacko s opinion of all of this chaos would be could you just be particular with the chaos you were talking about what s that the entire situation the steamy love affair and the reaction on baby kochamma s part and mammachi s part got it i don t think he d be happy about the love affair cause as it says it s like she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one blessed personally by the patriarch of antioch antioch an imperial entomologist and rhodes scholar from oxford so it s like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long and just thrown it out the window i m gonna have to disagree with that becca i mean i think that chacko is a liberal type he is very progressive he s a marxist he didn t allow his father to beat his mother as most indians traditionalists probably would be ok with i think that chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if some guy was having an affair with his sister as a social ideal i think he would be fine with everything i agree because i feel like oh god i had this whole plan of something to say and i can t remember sorry no it s not your fault well what is the only thing that made chacko upset at mammachi was it that she abandoned her children oh i got it yeah i feel like the most of this passage though it s third person narration it really feels like it s coming out of baby kochamma s mouth and it s like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff the whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black to quote the passage once again so i feel like that all really baby kochamma s words and not necessarily baba s beliefs and i feel like they have really contrasted beliefs yeah i mean i feel like all the diction you were talking about for instance when it says mammachi s rage at the old one eyed paravan standing in the rain drunk dribbling and covered in mud and it repeats mud a lot and i think it s that s just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they re trying and almost like mud covers things up so it s almost like it should be covered up and they were trying to cover it up but don t you feel like they used chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do oh he s coming back so we have to do this they kind of use him as the excuse to do it well it s sort of like chacko could intervene and so we have to do it now so we can t miss our chance to do it again i think that s important actually i think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here it wasn t their fault when the whole thing spun like a deranged top i think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie in the movie for example when mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if kayani gets married but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around i think that s this book and movie is really trying to say is this is what happens when you set up rules and don t adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change i ll just go in the fourth paragraph they talk about having a plan it s very orderly and they said that kochu maria was a midget lieutenant they had this very organized and planned out even though in the second paragraph she shuddered with a school girl shudder it s like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff yeah on that i really want to say cause it says school girl shudder at the beginning and then it back in the fourth paragraph when it s talking about their plan they re referred to as the two old ladies so that s contrasting in a way to be described which obviously it s important yeah i think that s one of the themes of the passage conflicts between age and which one is ultimately i don t want to say better but a better advantage i guess like in authority between age and youth you mean between old and young yeah age and youth which one can have a better life according to them they also play with age when they locked ammu up it s kind of like putting her in time out like they tricked her in to her room which is also a parallel i saw in the movie when they locked kalyani up so she couldn t get married it was to keep them from doing stuff i just want to bring up another theme of the passage where it s the very beginning where it s before we are completely ruined by the it kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs what you do in this society at least affects everybody around you and it kind of contrasts ammu s individualism with what societal hierarchy and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy so they have authority over her and so they re telling her not to do this and they re presenting their authority over her and chacko s even higher than them just cause he s a guy when the passage lists the life cycle events the weddings the funerals baptisms and birthday parties it says for generations to come so i feel like what peter was saying it affects all of society that also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people the funerals are when you die the baptisms are when you are just born so it s saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life that s how profound it is and even that sentence that peter was talking about before it goes any further before we are completely ruined i think that s also just family selfishness because they re just projecting what her the consequences of her actions will be for them not necessarily for her and in the movie where the leader of that house of she s just really concerned about herself she ll sacrifice all of the other women just so she s comfortable but does she also use a we i think both baby kochamma and diti say the same thing we re gonna be ruined by this we we we in regards to that i think in water you know how all the widows they sorta put them together and they sort of create this unity it s all out of despair because they all lost something in a sense mammachi lost her former love and so did ammu ammu had babies without it wasn t a formal tradition the way she had her babies and so in a sense she has she s in grievance and so those two aspects unites these women yeah they re all widows yeah they re all widows and that really but does that give them right to be oh understand that s why i feel like it says we not we like our family but more of like we women who are widowed austin what do you think do you think that gives them the right to because they ve also lost and because baby kochamma and mammachi has also experienced trauma so that also means diti as well her husband died when she was young does that give them the right to take that i don t think so cause that was actually one of my questions especially when it says her tolerance immense needs as far as her son was concerned became the fuel for unimaginable fury at her daughter and then just my question was is baby kochamma s actions motivated by indian society or her own emotions so i don t think that they should be able to from their past experience take it out on everybody else i think that what we re talking about right now maybe be reason that ghandi appears at the end of the film because ghandi as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism and it s when he shows up nice diti sees that may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain ghandi s existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women i think that ghandi in the movie represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once ghandi takes power the widows will gain power the untouchables won t be untouchable anymore they ll gain more rights so i think they look at him as not really rationalism because some people think that he s just crazy the brahmin caste don t see him as rational so i think it s more of a hope in an idealized society building off of what she said how ghandi represents re birth i think coincides with the movie s title water for me at least the way i saw it i felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie they washed themselves it was washing away their sins being reborn i thought who s the girl the one who killed herself kalyani i thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself because the way she was killing herself she was submersing herself in water and i thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff she in a sense she was clearing away her sins and so she would go to the next life sinless i think that the drowning of kalyani parallels to how sophie mol drowned how it s like the innocent life was taken by the water which isn t really innocence too but was kalyani innocent i think that if she hadn t been forced to do things she would have been she didn t feel right about what she had done i m gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way in both the movie and the book it says the fisherman had already found sophie mol she they drowned trying to cross the river and kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who norian really is the river is important in both works it s an inescapable wall so i don t think water is portrayed as a good image i mean it could possibly be both i think peter made a pretty good point about it sam did with kalyani s death and sophie mol s death but i think it could be both i think it s a duality thing and then going on combining what both ya ll said where you said it s an inescapably and the way they view it as washing away their sins view it as a cleansing thing also for example emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs and they re cleaning themself in this if water is just viewed a symbol they re cleaning themselves with something that s bad i also don t think that they depend on the water too to get their food from it they wash themselves in it yet it s also it creates this it s something that the paravans are trying to overcome a lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier but they depend on it they still need it so it s contrasting what they believe just like a duality thing yeah it s the family and god s talkings their immediate family they depend on each other because when you re a child you have to have an older figure to help you grow up but they are also they cause the turmoil with each other they create their own problems pretty much it s like you can t live with them but you can t live without them susan did you have a question yes i did well a lot of them are about similarities between characters but one thing that i thought about was how norian dealt with his lover s loss and how velutha was able to deal with being separated from ammu and do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations sorry i missed all this so she i heard well norian because he was a brahmin the highest caste i think he said we ll either going to calcutta or india to start his life you mean kolkata or i m sorry or england to become a lawyer so he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education and he could provide for himself velutha was an untouchable so he had no opportunity,0.0
nfl yeah so here s like you can see that the professional players who can pay that money they re really rich so there s so much sponsors that they pay for their helmets but like in high school football what they want is long pass cheaper material so they don t care much about the health about the guys they want to go just their problem is the money of the helmets how much cost of helmet is like helmets with kevlar or that stuff like they use in the military equipment so how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can save these thoughts so what kind of ideas you guys have how could you design a helmet so it s not this big or really neat and super expensive the type of padding we use so what ideas do you guys have so what kind of so you play football what kind of padding right now is inside of the helmet i mean they re not soft it s like it s air glove it s almost like a hard balloon stuck to your head so it s just one on the side and the whole top is full and one on the other side and one in the back but that s it i mean you could actually feel the hit but it you just don t get a concussion unless you re heavy so have you ever been hit have you ever had a helmet to helmet contact so where did you get hit my head almost like right here on top of your head right but there s padding there oh but you said you could still feel it i mean i could feel it for like a quick couple of seconds or so then it just goes away it s because of the padding i guess it s umm it s like so is there any way that you would change the design of the helmet that you have now um more cushion okay so that s kind of going back to what angel was talking about so how can we change the design to make it more cushiony but because if you have something that s too cushiony right is that going to decrease the time or increase the time and decrease the force if it s really cushiony oh that s really cushiony yeah oh you mean like it will just go yeah no right so you re saying you want it more cushiony you re saying you want it cheaper you re saying you want it smaller i think like what matt s kind of saying is more for comfort than for safety right right so why so can you relate sort of to what angel s saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous umm with the head rattling like if it hits on this side it s quicker to hit the other side is that what you mean what so how so think about how the padding is right now how it s stiff compared to something that kind of gave so think about relating this back to force times the change in time you can ask if it s built too soft it s going to hit you with a stronger force so what could happen to the time it s going to be slower it s going to be faster it s going to be faster so what s going to happen to the force the force is going to increase so it s going to hurt even more and it will be more dangerous so what you need is like a stable material that not too soft but at the same time so besides kevlar which you brought up which is i was thinking like like for example when you are hit and you re hit you want that like bulletproof that the force spreads in all the space of the body of the helmet so is you are hit here all the force is not concentrated in this place but is moving over all the helmet so it displaces the force so it s not on one area so i was like thinking like maybe like this big the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits it spreads to all the helmet so that s you versus less you spread all the force on your head so you have like less something that will transfer the motion yeah i like this idea but what i was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something cushiony on the outside so that it takes time for you to hit the helmet and once you hit the helmet the small cushiony so that it takes time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again and then hit you so kind of like an atmosphere yeah it will have like little layers it will probably have to make the helmet a little bit like bigger but not like don t make it like huge but have layers on there and then incorporate his idea when you re making waves so something like that first layer could help dissipate the force so we have cushiony against cushiony like boxers use and then they have the hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping so we have the cushiony part first so it s going to take time and i think that s what they use they put cushion on there so that it takes time for you to actually feel the force so that the force will be less and if you have cushion with cushion it s because you are increasing the time yeah because if you have two helmets that are hitting each other that are cushion and cushion it will take longer for them to hit each other and then the force will be decreased my question for matt is how big is the helmet oh the padding it s like thick it s kind of thick that s just the padding and then you have the helmet which is like that much more yeah it s like that thick how heavy is the helmet like when you re wearing it does it feeling like it s weighing you down yeah it takes time to get used to it and that day you re neck will hurt that s how heavy it is another version of like what we are trying to do i think it d also be cool maybe like helmet were like it was fitted to like the head and then it d have like inbetween kind of like a net structure which is a part of uh kind of like what he had but something that is hung i want to kind of imagine it like the bridges how they have like a whole bunch of little columns but just a whole bunch that is attached to the outside of the helmet i will draw it and i ll show you guys you had your hand up do you want to share while he yeah i was wondering since we re talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the type of brain damage that you can get just like an actual name like i heard concussion other injuries other names can you tell what a concussion is what is a concussion ask the group well a concussion is when it s when you your brain between your actual brain and your skull there is a liquid like spinal fluid is it and that s supposed to cushion your brain from touching the or hitting your skull but a concussion is when it s hitting and it s going back and forth i mean gradually it will go back to normal but that s my understanding of concussion and you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest areas of the impact so what part do you think is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain on your brain the sides what do the sides control well it wasn t like that i thinking like in the structure of the of the skull so the sides where the nerves enter like your optic nerves yeah so i think that s like less pain it s like a really big hit here can kill a man so i think that hit is worst you re saying the skull is thinnest right there yeah it s not as thick as the other parts it s thickest like right here what does your frontal lobe control so that s what kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most developed frontal lobe and then on the sides is more of your sensory stuff and then in the back is your actually your occipital lobe for your eyes is in the back a long with your movement your cerebellum so different spots that s why you have padding here and here and back here is to protect all sides of the brain so a concussion is just like your brain keeps vibrating basically after the blow so i like to think about it and i meant to bring this in and i apologize so if you have think about your tupperware and inside the tupperware you have an egg you just cracked a nice egg inside and then you shake it so imagine that egg is your brain and that tupperware is your skull so the harder you rattle it what s going to happen to the egg it will break it s gonna break right the yolk s going to break right i mean your brain doesn t really break but you can think that it s just kind of the movement because if you think about what does newton s first law say an object that s in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by outside force so if the brain if you get hit here which way is your brain going to go that way until it hits the skull and then it s going to thunk so that s what they call rattling your cage i was thinking of like when i play baseball when i swing the bat and i hit the ball and my hands keep like i can feel it inside and like even after a minute it will keep rattling so now take that and think about how that would okay so david can you uh explain what you have so we can this is kind of like the bridge idea that i had where like there s like different columns that go around like the frame so in this it would kind of be like the head goes right here and the helmet s right here and these would be like some kind of material that s bendable so when something hits it they would bend in so to absorb kind of the impact kind of like a cage in the racing cars like how racing cars have a cage inside of them just in case they roll over the cage still protects the person yeah kind of no but yeah kind of like that but these are like cushions yeah so they absorb the momentum so like a coil like for your bed the bed spring that when you jump up on it you rebound back so wouldn t that be more dangerous if it s elastic yeah it s elastic and when we did the little cars when it was elastic it completely transferred all of its momentum to the other car so when you get hit it will just like swing and then all the momentum will hit you instead of both of you sharing it so if you share it d probably be better but i don t know if that s because i was also thinking of mattresses a little sleep mattresses and how they talked about the coils and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger over here than over here and then they have the new ones now that are like foam the tempurpedic ones yeah so i was thinking also if you like spread out where the momentum goes saying if you spread out where it won t be in one certain area then you won t get hit really hard right here and if you get hit hard like over here it d probably be better than getting hit hard just right there yeah it will probably be less of a force so when they design like a helmet they ve got one piece thing where it s like your body their shoulder pads connected to their helmet so your body absorbs some of that too instead of just your head so that depends how you turn your head and would it be good if your body have you guys ever heard that people who are like drunk drivers they kind of walk away from a car crash and it s the passengers or the victims are the ones that get hurt the most so think about what s different between their body in motion and the other person s body in motion so they re looser right they re not tightening their muscles compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact we flex right just waiting for it and so by being more rigid your body doesn t move you re trying to fight against the motion so you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that because you it hurt your body more because you re trying to fight against what you re body is actually going to do instead of the other person who s just like really loose is moving with it so there s not as much impact well i ve been playing football and how you play like you want to win you hit someone you want to after that you re still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like i know what he is saying is like if you see someone about to collide with you you want to hit him back instead of yeah why is that related that to momentum because momentum is vector right so you have to think about the direction and of the way that things are moving so think back to when we were playing with different cars so you had the greater mass in one car going this way and had the smaller mass going this way right so what would you want to do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the raise his speed increase the speed right and so by knowing that you re going to get hit you re going to run a little faster so then what was the what is the ending result there so like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass mean like how do you think is like inelastic i don t know like so what s going to happen are they going to stay stuck together so it s elastic so it comes off right think about it like a rubber band an elastic rubber band you can stretch it so elastic is is saying something that s going to rebound whereas inelastic you re just rigid there is no motion i guess you should say i thought that was inelastic when you hit something it will both go off completely and elastic it will stick together and inelastics magnets,0.0
counting on that i agree with aj but also i think that what i want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what aj was saying it s good to have a backup just in case you want it and we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there so we know that so we re having other people work with it but the problem is is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that what if they messed up what if they blow up or do something wrong and if they re not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there s gonna be a lot more problems and if it s not able to do the same things that s going to be completely bad too okay eric said go up to fix things what would be some things that we would need to make sure that we re going up to maintain in space just to kind of follow up international space station okay international space station some of the satellites we have in orbit okay satellites that do what for us television and communication okay ms mccall what s that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares you can just write sun probe sun probe that s fine excuse me while i turn this on and the hubble hubble s gone a lot longer than they expected it to so if it breaks we d want to repair it especially since we don t have a new one alana i know how mer was talking about the risks like with the challenger and that was really devastating but i remember the wife whose husband died on challenger she said that he knew the risks that s part of being an astronaut and being in nasa and willing to go up there and you re risking your life it s not like they went in there totally blind about that i think that s kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now we have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that i say go for it okay blanca and then megan i get what she s saying with they risked their lives but you re also risking the money and time that everyone has put into it they spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space and like the challenger it just exploded and they didn t even really get that far just for one minor error and i don t think they should cut all the way like they were saying have it just when you need it but it s still a lot of money that our country doesn t really have right now so maybe it s not the most important thing and there s other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that we ll go megan then bieber so you know how we re paying russia to fly up to the international space station i think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station because then we have more funding for nasa and then we have a shuttle then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to russia to fly up there i feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up not for free but we can fly up with the united states and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in they can pay us for it and then we get the money okay bieber you need to sit close eli then we ll go rachel i don t know what color to show but russia s not making a profit off of us riding up there they re just trying to cover their costs it s not like we ll be doing good business ferrying people to the international space station it s not like a tourist attraction or anything it s pretty bland up there russia s just trying to pay to get us up there that s the cost of flying somebody there they re not making profit out of it okay good that s a downpoint rachel i agree with what eli said and also people were talking earlier about jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs and i think i read somewhere that they created 25 000 jobs or something like that but if you think about it if there s 300 million people that s still less than 1 of the population so while it seems like a big number it s still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else especially with the economy so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on nasa on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on nasa and spending billions of dollars amber then clark i was going to say i kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now at this point in time so i don t think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that s also putting a lot of people out of work clark the statistics with the jobs created are probably from when nasa was being used a lot and now that it s been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut and i don t think in this economy people need jobs requiring that much education not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that people just need regular jobs in general so you re saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe and like in science and stuff and not everybody has that that s a downpoint luis going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things i found out that the funding for nasa only accounts for 0 7 of the us government spending i feel like if you just cut all of that that s not really going to make a huge difference when the government s spending 99 3 on other things we ll go hallie then troy going back to the risk of sending people out into space i researched and i found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened as we re pushing for more people and more money we re actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back the risk is just becoming more and more that s an interesting point as we re slowly cutting back on the budgets already we re automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts troy i actually support them cutting the budget because for one when they cut budget they re setting aside money to buy more space exploration from private companies those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government which also stimulates the economy a lot more i mean if everybody s employed by the government like what could happen to greece okay shannon hasn t spoken bieber kind of off of what holly said with the risk and everything going up i did a little research and with nasa there was only a 4 1 fatality rate out of something like 439 astronauts there have only been 18 deaths i feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut okay so even with the budget cuts we re not seeing this huge increase jillian a lot of people are making the points that it s only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles but at the same time i don t think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide put off by one shuttle launch it s 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it s killing the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone not just the people in the space shuttle so you re taking the environmental aspect besides looking at costs besides looking at jobs there s this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide what is the issue associated with carbon dioxide jillian the ozone layer depleted and global warming thank you global warming tyler to go along with what luis said they only get 0 7 of the national spending but we also have gained more knowledge from nasa than any other government thing we can discover maybe how earth is going to end and we can discover things that are more important than other government government spending so you re kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending we ll go eli then justin also luis said it doesn t account for very much of the us budget and if we cut that spending it s really not going to go to anything more productive maybe more guns or something it s not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people it s just going to go to corporations and wars and then in regards to co2 emissions does anyone know how much co2 emissions a moose puts out in a year far more than a truck driver cows and moose i think they can flirt over that i think that s just moose so you re making the comparison to say the idea that even though it s a human made craft if we look at natural sources of the co2 emission and the relative frequency that a moose passes gas a space shuttle launch doesn t have that big of an effect on the environment touche anyone have a cup that hasn t spoken yet that wants to jump in real quick justin going off of what tyler said if we stop funding nasa then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of earth just doesn t allow us to see that far so it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future interesting point amber then eric besides everything about the jobs nasa has created a lot of things that have helped us today different technologies like in someone s presentation they were saying something about they re creating lighter systems for firefighters and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff so there s a lot of technology that s been created because of nasa so i think it s benefited us a lot more than it hasn t helped us and so you re saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives it s not just useful for exploring many new things i forgot my order was it eric on that one i have a couple different connections one of them s with the cost like they re saying it s 0 7 of the total budget but the thing is not only is it that low of a cost it s 14 billion just to give you an actual number it s 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of nasa this year just for this year alone to give you a comparison it s around 640 between 680 for the military budget that is 47 times more expensive now you can say well alright that s the military the thing is that first of all it has a lot higher mortality rate second of all it s a lot less productive in general i mean we re pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet i m sorry but that s not very cool in general for one of those things we re trying to get a high fatality rate not for our side but the other side but the other thing is that for jobs creations if you want to create more jobs and you re going for a more positive feel you wouldn t decrease funding for nasa you would increase funding because think about it if you increased it 47 times to the military i m pretty sure you d get a lot more than one million even a lot lot more than just one million jobs from nasa if you increased this funding a lot because imagine whole new planets just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet and with seven billion people we can t hold that many people very long on this planet but there are so many other planets out there that we could easily fit everyone there s enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet that s how many planets there are so you re thinking planning for the future that it might be beneficial for us holly as i was researching i found out that there s really no short term benefits and we re not guaranteed long term benefits yes we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us we re not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from magnetic storms there might be some way we can save ourselves but we re not guaranteed that so you re saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into the factor we can keep researching but we may never find the answer monique you got some info yeah i think when hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks we ve talked about what was up there the benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section we gain knowledge we need to study the sun probe and hubble and international space station with jobs it provides a whole section of jobs having shuttles go up to space not only that but they ve created new inventions through that and i think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital going from there there s going to be more not just stopping now so again tying in the cost benefit analysis that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs a j and then we ll go alana i guess to counter what troy said and what a few people have said when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money it s not just about the economy when you think about it nasa wasn t meant to help the economy at all and it wasn t meant for job creation even though it has employed so many people through the research that i did there was a story from somebody that s going to be retiring just because he knows he d lose his job anyway he said that after 30 years this is all i know we re losing the most brilliant minds our country has because they just don t know what else to do nasa s been open for decades and that s their job technicians and analysts they re not going to just become accountants or something there s nothing after nasa that s probably the highest most prestigious thing what do you do after that it s not like they re just going to fill minimum wage jobs which is what most people are looking for right now anyway if you re thinking about job creation it s a good point you have all these highly educated specialized people as a j points out where are they going to go are they going to be able to find jobs within our country are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries it s a good point alana then troy i know we re talking a lot about the cost benefit and job creation but i want to go back to the safety and i have a question for everyone just to think about the main part in all the failed missions especially with the shuttle and the challenger it s basically been human error you know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn t listen that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and everything but i ve been thinking what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human and the possible errors that we make like robots we use robots to build half our cars and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate so do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make that s an interesting point we ll have to put that on the question board troy what you got kind of to counter what a j said these people are highly educated minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now people that have highly specialized degrees they re really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees if you can do quantitative physics those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who s just a finance agent so your counterpoint is the idea that because they re so highly educated they will find some sort of a niche yeah there s a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better interesting jillian back to what alana said if you re using robots to make it safer that s also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots if you re using robots as the engineers then you re having people lose jobs interesting point so kind of a counterpoint to shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics there s some drawback association we ll go rachel going back to what eric said a while ago he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget but i feel like the military helps a lot of people and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people because the military pays for a lot of people s education university and stuff i know a lot of people now since university is so expensive a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for so i feel like it should have a higher budget because it s creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren t necessarily has a doctorate in physics or something people that are really smart like what troy said they won t really have that much of a problem finding jobs especially with a big corporation they don t have to necessarily work for the government or nasa or something so i think that the budget should stay where it is because that s pretty funny we ll go megan and tyler i don t know when it was mentioned but we were talking about how we re trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed and i feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now we re trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that s gone i feel like that s really important for the development of earth is to know what it s going to be like when there is no more what can we do so that we don t turn into a mars or venus what can we do now to stop it from happening good so you re making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there s an issue with our magnetosphere potentially could we wind up like mars so kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed future wise so almost like a selfish need to figure out what s going on out there and where we might go anyone that hasn t spoken yet want to comment,0.0
so we go back remember this do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest okay what s happening is things are getting not broken up another example of that would be measure 16 to 17 you would not want to breathe at the end of 16 now i want to go back to 13 and i want you to do what we did yesterday where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties so what that does at 13 is it should da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daa da da da da da da da da da da da da dum okay it s kind of funny to do that on the bass drum so just play the regular part on the bass drum okay i can try to nah i d rather you not because it s going to muffle it s going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing try it at 13 everybody da da da da da da da working on accents one two and ready and go look at measure 15 da da daa da da da da what s happening is some of you are changing 15 to this tell me what s wrong with this anybody recognize what s wrong with that adrian you played four yeah i played four sixteenth notes and then i played a note on beat four it s got a one and two three e and up listen again here s the correct way oops wrong finger listen again try that measure 15 one and two and ready and go again more accent that last note s really short and it s really strong one two 15 and play now play it the way it s written but feel it the way you just played it that will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note one two ready and go and okay see how it places it very crisply let s go back to 13 play it break it down into the sixteenths da da da da da da da ready 13 we re going to go all the way through 20 one and two and ready and play and now i m going to get to what we are beginning to learn today i m going to go ahead and put my tie up here now is there anyone who can tell me what this is what is that daniel a dotted eighth note this is a dotted eighth note who can tell me what this note is sedekia one sixteenth note it is a sixteenth note so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot with that in mind can somebody tell me what the value of that note is cole it would last for like three beats three beats and then you would have a sixteenth note okay i think you re on the right track it would last for three of something but not three beats landon three fourths of a beat it would be three fourths of a beat so let s think about this remember an eighth note in 4 4 time gets half of a beat everybody what s half of a half one fourth one fourth so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat well that sounds a little bit complicated but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here so who can tell me what i would write for counts under this dotted eighth note raise your hand lydon would it be one e one e because that s the same as having three of both and jaylin what would go here a e okay so this is just another way of writing this let s do a measure of counting that ready and go and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and now i want all my first row to do that four times okay and go and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and second row ready and go and one e and a two and one e and a two,0.0
that they need to make some sort of a change like the turning point like there s a turning point there s some kind of change that needs to occur do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change no i think some no in fahrenheit 451 how some people were assuming that mildred already knew but she just didn t want to not like accept it but not be part of it she didn t want to be part of the change she just wanted to be in tune with society she never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point even when she had the opportunity she didn t right i think emotion plays a big role in that too because faber let fear get in the way of him doing something so he basically created that little earpiece thing so that somebody else could do it for him and he could watch over somebody that s actually doing it another person who s carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is beatty because although he had all of the knowledge much more knowledge than montag had about society and everything he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it then what s the point if he s not going to gain anything out of it do you think also because he has all that knowledge he wants to use it to have power since he knows all that he wants to manipulate keep them in control keep them in check and stuff no i don t think it s that he wants power i mean it s that he s seen the bad side of things and like all humans you don t like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it with education he knows it s good because it helps you think outside of the box and everything but it s bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything then you realize that there s genocides there s slavery there s wars there s too much negativity the government also doesn t want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go the more information they know the more possible ways they can use it against them i like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff because i guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people vulnerable vulnerable it s like if the people were the government s subordinates so it s not the government s people who they re protecting it s pretty much who they re in control of i kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing like in harrison and bridge around again you get to see the emotion or what george has to go through but yet he doesn t do anything about it harrison does it says right here his thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm it s showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head or whatever but harrison is the one doing the actions he s the one that wants to go against the government and george isn t so do you think their relationship and the correlation of george and harrison is just like montag and faber s where faber doesn t want to do anything because he didn t want to go to jail in the south george doesn t want to go to jail because he doesn t want to lighten his own way because he would get what was it seven years yeah for each sled that he takes out and harrison is actually doing stuff and montag isn t doing stuff so do you think that you need that person the one behind the scenes doing the stuff and then a person that s actually doing it or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill i think that you need people who are i think that you need people who are but i think that it s easier to so i think that way is better so you don t get in trouble i think the people that have the people in the front lines are always useful they are easier to camoflauge they are the ones with the real plans these people in the front don t usually come up with them yeah but you have the plans and then you don t do it but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don t know how to use it well not every body s that brave that s why you need to i think people need the support system like faber was montag s support system he had a plan don t let him tell you he sees walk away walk away i guess here s my question so in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow i want you to think our question is to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws right created by government i know i m asking you to respond with to what extent should citizens comply with these unfair laws but we re also talking about so who should act right so who should be the one to act out to lead to go against the government because we re looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out we re looking at people who have knowledge who have strength who are talented but they re not leaders and we re also looking at people who may not have those qualities they have the potential to have those qualities but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push so when we say to what extent should citizens comply do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices do you even think that s fair that it s a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole i want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we ve seen a group of people whether it is a whole group or just a couple of people who take charge who lead and impact change are there any examples that you can connect to that do you think that that s even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people i see it as a way every time there s a change or a law or something that affects a certain group of people it s never really based on the whole group of people like all citizens it s more of a target and when a certain group is attacked or targeted it makes others not really i don t want to say care but it doesn t really matter to them because they re not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that or yeah it s just basically it s that group of people who have to i guess express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right but i think it s necessary for a unit you probably need that one person who spreads the message and then i think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it s going to be your turn so here s my question because on your ap exam on your final exam for your argumentative essays you have to be able to generate your own examples so i know omar you ve got a very clear idea but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific and that s what you can discuss let s see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific you want to say hey let s look at this specific example where this actually happened any thoughts on that anything with slavery with frederick douglass and the abolitionists in the north they really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and i guess that s where civil disobedience comes from is the abolishment of slavery well the need to abolish slavery that it really wasn t really blacks or africans or whatever you called them back then wanting to be set free was people that weren t even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free and i think that s more important and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery they re not benefiting they re not getting negative from it so it s like you really think that it s wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation it s saying that it s wrong i want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that s going on right now because i guess maybe not a lot of you are aware but there s i don t know if you guys heard something about the green eye that recently that s in the past and i think that s very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but i guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in that kind of stops them and discourages them from to keep going so i guess that idea is i don t know it s kind of opressive because they re trying to maintain you in that little it s just marginalizing you and yeah i think it needs more support so i want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests right people were really protesting that and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against right and when we look at the questions to what extent should we comply with unfair laws if that is an unfair piece of legislation to what extent do you then choose to protest how far would you be willing to take it because we talked about this this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion like look at harrison right dancing on stage as a ballerina doesn t really seem all that tough right but for him he was taking a big stance right not about borderline violence right i want you to look at what thoreau did he didn t pay his taxes he wanted to go to jail he was happy there he was like don t bail me out had nothing to do with violence right you hear a lot of people protesting you know issues regarding the dream act but to what extent should they comply with the laws do you use violence do you even take it there do you use more creative forms of protesting i want you to consider how far do you take it how far do you show your protest what is acceptable and where do you draw the line good reaction lots of reaction let s hear from people we haven t heard from i want you to go back and think about your goals that you set i m hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions chose goals that might push you to speak up so let s hear from a few folks that we haven t heard from yet and share the air time any volunteer jesus what do you think like omar said like the dream act has an ill affect on a lot of people it doesn t really affect me but i know a lot of friends that it is affecting it s not really fair that it really didn t pass but when we want to try to push something like julian said for slavery it didn t really take it took such a long time for them to really get the rights there was the abolishment there was frederick douglass during that time but as time went then came martin luther king who was the center person who started the really big move for african americans to realize their own rights he lead the protests marches if you gather groups of people over time if you speak up with your voice people will hear even people like african americans they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal there should be rights and everyone no matter what color you are so for latinos like us for the it s such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights but the dream that was once dead but even though it didn t pass people should not be put down like aw it didn t pass so they ll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights cause if we stay together anything can happen if we stay together as one something will happen i am hearing two things and we ll get back to stephanie really quickly i think she s just itching to get in this conversation i m hearing two things one that it takes a collective group effort it s not just one person but it needs to be many people involved as many people involved and i m also hearing that it takes a lot of time so those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws that s kind of like right now that it s kind of more modern because you think so no no no i want you take this idea that omar brought this idea of mental slavery of oppression of our intellect our intelligence is that something that you think is just recent is that something that s been happening over time i want you to think about that and see we might isolate one part of the problem but i want you to think on a broader scale is it really just one isolated event or is this one in a stream of events stephanie you had something that you were yeah all of them were in the governement and i was thinking of the movie milk how they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in california and to be heard which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way but he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard one part in the movie that i ll always remember is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he s gay and all of that but he just hangs up but yet he does it for him most likely because he wants people like that to be heard and that s kind of what my connection is i think another historical event besides the slavery and what you just said is the nine eleven i think it s the short term one it took actually really quick the terrorists going up there it just took one simple idea to tell them oh let s just go,1.0
i can go into group two because that except this one is like these two are like both like pop these two are kinda like both pop because water s not bubbly this one s bubbly and this one s coca cola or dr pepper do you have a secret rule to use we re gonna get like one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles because they re kinda the same okay and this one like so i m gonna make sure i m understanding what your rule is gonna be does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container it s the bubble bubbles and stick to the side yeah okay so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side is that right yeah okay great alright alright friends in order to be closer together to really see how this is going to work i m going to ask anagelia s group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here go ahead and bring your liquids with you thank you very much and what we re going to do is we re going to set up our rule so that it s up here at the front so actually anagelia if you don t mind callie and natalie if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then anagelia s going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here okay thank you so we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table for your what s my rule okay so you re thinking of your property and you re going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don t fit the property here who would like to go first who would like to start okay so ryan s group ryan s group come up and set up one that fits your rule just a minute ryan isabella needs to come with you one that fits your rule here and one that doesn t fit your rule here just one just one one in each okay thank you you can be seated okay so we have this one fits their rule this one doesn t fit their rule i can tell bryson s already thinking about what it could possibly be this one can fit their rule hold on one second that s where we re going but wait one second okay let s talk about what we see any ideas so far of what might be going on here bryson do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space the bubbles on the top okay so you think it has something to do with bubbles do you have one that fits bubbles that one he s got a hypothesis now lena he s got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be do you think this fits the rule yeah okay so now we need to check in with isabella and ryan does that fit the rule yes it does okay it doesn t fit my rule so your rule should be the same as your partner s do you remember what that rule was ryan yeah okay great alright so anagelia thanks for raising your hand do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn t fit the rule thank you callie callie will you check in with isabella and ryan and see if that fits isabella does that fit the rule yes okay anybody else who s ready to bring one up oh another rule another one that might fit or doesn t fit rigo would you like to try which one do you think would go with this group which ones from the ones you have would go with this group bryson giving you a hint no that one doesn t that one here so you think both of these fit the blue one just the blue one because look at this one it doesn t leave white bubbles okay so if that one doesn t fit the rule where would it go rigo where would this one go this one over here right just hold that thought for a just a second no this one we said does fit it right isabella and ryan are we on track so far yes okay anagelia did your group have another one to bring up okay that one you think fits in this side fits the rule and callie you think this one doesn t fit the rule look when it shakes doesn t do anything okay okay natalina do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us what s going on here i think it s the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group when you shake it it has lots of bubbles that one doesn t okay so let s go back a minute though because you said two different things sit on your botton rigo first you said bubbles and not bubbles and then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it is that the same rule or is that different is the shaking part important do you think to that rule okay so can you state it one more time for us when you shake it if there s bubbles it will go that one if it doesn t go bubbles it goes in that one okay and isabella and ryan is that correct yup excellent so the shaking was the really important part of that great at least for this one it s weird right because right now this one has no bubbles but if i shake it it gets bubbles later okay excellent can you remember which ones you had in your group yes can you come and get them i m not sure if i can i m glad you can remember can you remember rigo which one you put out there this no that one s ours no this is ours um yeah one two three four five i think you ve got five these ones are originally from isabella and ryan i think yeah isabella and ryan can you come back and get yours great alright which partnership is ready to tell to not tell but to do another secret rule i thought i brought a blue did you think you brought a blue one you figured it out okay natalina s group can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule natalina you want to check that one more time make sure that s correct okay this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier and let s leave this on the table anagelia can you remind what the rule is stick to the sides anagelia can you remind callie what the rule is too go remind callie so these two do fit right alright show us one that doesn t please okay careful with the liquids please you okay alright we actually got a little extra help here now didn t we we got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not isabella do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn t fit the rule ryan can you sit on your bottom again please watch what isabella is doing oh cool see if you agree ryan watch what isabella s doing and see if you agree okay i agree natalina callie and anagelia thumbs up is that correct did she put it in the right place yeah okay good bryson and rigo do you guys have one that you want to put in yeah more than one more than one okay oh three oh go ahead if you think that s right i think that s right rigo rigo can you tell us why you put these two here because it can bubble bubbles in it because they have bubbles in them does this does not just a second just a second callie does this one have bubbles in it yes it does so it s not bubbles and no bubbles you re on the right track though take a look again ryan do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here stuff on the side and this one it goes away after awhile maybe this is the rule thank you ryan so far so good yeah okay yeah let s bring up all the rest oh bryson you can go ahead and leave those there you can go ahead and leave those there i think we re okay actually if you have any other liquids to bring up this one bring them on up and put them where they belong and we ll see if we can figure out what the rule is bring it on up bring it on up ryan bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes this one s confusing ooh a confusing one i love a confusing one do you know why because it helps you think it helps you think exactly it makes it more difficult to figure out would you like to consult with someone do you want to consult with ryan ryan come here a minute your partner needs your help she s trying to figure out where this one goes what do you think i think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one now remember we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule because look this one has bubbles this one if i shake it has bubbles so bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule okay thanks for your help ryan anybody else give isabella some assistance here well you know the rules already right anagelia what do you think anagelia which one do you think it goes in listen to anagelia rigo what s your opinion what do you think does it go in this group or this one what do you think even though you know what the rule is can you help her figure out how to classify it rigo are you watching what do you think it goes in in that one that one in this group right here okay what do you think isabella you want bryson s idea what does bryson think i think it goes in that one because because most of them kind of move when you shake them but when you shake those they don t oh interesting let s try that out okay okay ryan come a little closer to me right now please we re trying out something different bryson just said the ones rigo you can stay where you are you re right close by no bryson just said something really interesting he just said stand on your own two feet please thank you he just said that these ones don t move when you shake them and these ones do move when you shake them and that s how they re classified so i want to just double check that i make sure that i agree with what you re saying okay bryson does this one move when i shake it not really i can t really try it out okay see what you think it kinda does does this one move when you shake it yes yes okay oh it sticks on the walls ah ha so are you amending your rule are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides yes so this group right here is ding ding ding ding ding ding this group right here is the one s that stick on the sides yes ding ding ding ding ding ring the bell ring the bell but we still haven t figured out even if we know that that s what the secret rule is where does this one go that one that one that one okay natalina let s take your opinion first rigo we re listening to natalina and then we ll hear from you okay go ahead natalina i don t think it follows our rule it does you think it s totally out here it s separate it s not in either category no i don t think it goes in this one you don t think it goes in this one no i do think it goes because because it doesn t really stick to the walls it doesn t really stick to the walls okay you wanna hold it make sure stick to the other opinions other opinions anagelia i couldn t hear you could you say it louder so the group can hear you go ahead it should go there because when you move it some parts stick to the wall and some parts when you move it it sticks to the part it does stick to the walls yeah okay it s dirty isabella what do you think i think it should go in this one because it kind of it sticks to the wall at first and then it goes down so and then doesn t stick to the wall okay it sticks to the wall first and then it doesn t so you think it goes in this one may i have it just for a minute one thing i m noticing that s a little confusing for me if i look at this one compared to all the others this is the only one that s not colored in this group does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they re colored somehow so this one s not as sticky because it s less colored maybe i don t know so you re saying it sticks at first but then not so much after that can we tell how much this one sticks no yeah yeah it really sticks it really sticks how about this one can you tell how much this one sticks yeah it kinda sticks that does stick most of it some of it that does so it sticks but it is most of it goes away and some stays some goes away and some stays,0.0
i m not too sure if i like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it i m not too sure about that it makes it less it s different in an awkward way i don t know how to explain it it doesn t have any depth to it it has no dimension like she s standing there he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then it looks like she s laying down actually yeah it does i mean he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop and i m just not feeling it i like the mick jagger one but i m not feeling this taylor swift one see i like pop art i just i don t know did you notice that what i thought it was a green that goes in to this that s on them it s more like a quiet like she s sleeping softness but i didn t notice it that it goes into purple periwinkle and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side did you see that then it goes in to two and he breaks off the colors and it s like all right let s take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions and then we ll talk about a whole group discussion and see what we all have and what we want to write in a sense it would be a good picture for the stance that she s in you know the title of the album is called fearless and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless in the way she s standing the way he did it it just doesn t look like her it s like the wind s coming back and it pushes her hair yeah but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera but then her hair wouldn t have been like that yeah but they just need some big ole fans it s hollywood you can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back you would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless you have to think it s more of country music i mean i could see if you were saying like hip hop pop and you get like all forceful what s up i m here but they re saying you know she s a pop icon if she s a country artist then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts because she s mainstreaming into the different areas she s creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys you wouldn t compare her to kenny chesney those who want newer generation of country right all right let s just try and get to our last question and then we ll talk about whole group and get you back in here let s go ahead and start you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer if you want your input put in so let s just talk about the describe section what we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words what kind of words would you use to describe this piece let s start with mick jagger bold bold proud proud electric electric okay those are good ones what about taylor swift it s more feminine more soft it s pale it s delicate and delicate soft you said soft it s like he s almost scared when he s doing taylor swift compared to mick jagger because mick jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere i think he almost makes taylor look almost intimidated she s kind of pushing away the position and you have all these colors around her with the selection and innocence yeah i think we talked about that with taylor a little bit you kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it like paints a picture she has an innocent expression i d say innocent yeah okay fierce you say fierce okay it s like her personality she just breaks it out with this bold pose all right good so those are some good words key words to describe it so analyzing let s figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss colors colors color s a big one in both of them actually paint strips the paint strips it looks like it s a lot of paint it kind of creates a lot of movement with the way that it s flowing through the pieces all right so our big ones are color he said in the video color is everything and that s his main focus is color the different colors make the value in the picture the dark colors make the darker shades and light colors he uses more bold colors in mick jagger than he did in taylor and like the contrasting colors of mick jagger are more loud i d definitely say it s louder okay good let s discuss the movement a little bit so if you look at it i see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair i like how the hair is like that and i like her position from the side because i think it adds interest like i was saying a second ago if she was looking straight forward i don t think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side and that s just my personal opinion but i like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it s creating the movement through the piece and then with the mick jagger one the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me how he chose the green and the red to contrast each other i think that s big bold move in this area good now what are our focal points faces faces and what are the big things that factor in for that why is that what did he do the colors around her make her pop the colors surrounding if you look the face is white right here and then her skin tone is pale as well so that kind of pops out against the bold colors what do you guys think about the materials the silk screen and the acrylic paint you guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars and just dipped in a couple different ones and just started coloring so what do you guys think about his process and the materials he uses he doesn t really choose what direction he just kind of goes with the flow it s very free if you watch him mindless mindless creativity he does what comes to him which is interesting any other comments about the actual process or materials i think it would have been more amazing if he didn t use the silk screens so you d rather him just paint it than add the silk screen i think it would be more like a wow factor and some of his pieces are just paintings more of the people though like the rollins he painted and the ones he did for president obama president reagan some of the statue of liberty and also some of the other people like aerosmith and the beatles as well and he s usually famous for painting his faces and he would go into the color,0.0
what part of soccer you really want to know what about the measuring or even the measure that s what you ve got to figure out or how long you can okay i mean how many like times you can do it okay so you could sit there and count how many bounces kicks or you could sit here with the timing how much you can do it and how much time you need okay how many per minute so you ve got lots of ideas you re going to have to choose that do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other yeah okay so i think you have both come up with all four of you you guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one and you ll collect your data and you ll collect your data and then present it as a company how about that soccer team or company alright alright you ve got a good name alright that s part of it it works catch your attention i know stephanie we re having trouble because we barely decided on it we didn t do the friction one but the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle the little car that you pull back and see how far it goes okay and the parachute one so i thought of the parachute one what do you think yeah you re a team on it okay so what are you going to measure with a parachute pardon yeah you re going to use metric which is centimeters stephanie s got control of the metrics so can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes well we don t know how far because we know we can t throw it out the window oh no it s too far okay but you know what maybe on the counter you guys are coordinated i would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights how high you could you could do some test runs right yeah don t you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision okay yeah and you know what if you d like if we have time i want you to do test runs in here but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear that s what i was thinking okay but i do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final but make your hypothesis what you re thinking because i think you re on a roll here it s going to be good i don t like his interview so how far in this experiment can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something okay i think you re making another experiment right so what s your first experiment just how fast it would drop by itself how fast from one distance yeah okay so one distance you re going to see how fast it ll drop and then you re going to compare that to from that distance adding weights to it okay alright well i wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights okay so she s got one experiment and you ve got another one do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together you do yours and you do yours because you only can change one variable at a time right yeah so what s your variable you re going to measure i m going to measure the distance how far how high different distances and what are you going to do and you re going to time it right yeah okay and you re going to do what s your variable that you re going to change the weight okay but you re going to see how fast it drops yeah alright so i think you re going to need another paper okay because you ve got two experiments going are you going to support each other in each one yeah that s pretty cool double points how are you guys doing oh i like it okay tell me about this one okay so we re going to get two or three different size basketballs like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then yeah and then we re going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there so like how high it bounces depending on its size oh so the size of the balls to see how high it bounces okay if it bounces higher what do you think i think the small one will bounce higher because there s less material to like have to drop from there like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn t go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher so based on your observations you re a good observer so your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would whoa are these your averages yeah they re my averages wow okay good so how are you guys going to present it as a team she s probably going to do like what we thought would happen and i m probably going to do the results of what actually happens are you comfortable with that uh huh okay to make it really clear what you did yeah yeah okay i think that ll be really good because this is great this is great to show and then you re writing your conclusion with numbers in it i like that and then you told yours was rejected right yeah okay now does that mean you re a failure no do you guys mind going first sure because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment i think that might give them some confidence and it ll take the pressure off them because they don t really want to go first okay so let s go aqui tenemos que cambiar la friccion sobre dos tenemos que cambiar oh wow the graph looks good and your data chart looks good so jenni will you shows yours on the first dictation thing when we have to go up there do we have to go up by step like show everything what do you think or just show our graph what do you think would be the best i say showing the graph should we show like our question and then should we show the whole thing what do you think i don t know i think so showing both okay but it s probably the most important thing to convince them i d definitely show your data okay we ll show his because it s better than mine okay very good and let s see yes it looks professional so these numbers how many times did you do this experiment three times wait four three twelve 100 i don t know because there s five and there s three okay we ve got one two three four five trials here is that correct no we went up three but he wrote trials for these oh okay so we can fix that que dibujaste no tienes que poner esto tienes que poner esto it s very neat so you added one two three and divided by by three okay alright that s how you got the average yeah okay and who figured out the answer me jenni wow jenni we did was it highest to lowest yeah highest minus lowest divided by two awesome you definitely should show this and then this would be uncertainty yeah and these are the mounted distance with different kinds of what are these five things the shoes okay the shoes it gets tiring when you have to do it three times right now my question is if you didn t have the shoes how did you get the data for it i did it at my house you did them at your house okay and then what s this one right over here the socks okay and that s one you definitely did at school yeah we did it here and we also did the vans here and the vans alright so that s good would you explain that to the class yeah that these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error yeah because of the surface like at his house it would have been not like floor it would be carpet or something like that yeah what s your floor like where you did it well i had to do it like outside during the rain oh my goodness okay so you ve got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any yeah okay maybe it would and so what would a scientist do in the next time would have done it in a dry place yeah do it in a dry place yeah i like that okay so you ll tell that for the next time yeah but i really liked how you guys didn t give up how you actually did the socks compared to your vans and you know how you pull those out what are research we could have done your boot oh yeah my boot yeah i could have want to do my boot no i m good no my legs are tired okay i m sure they are well did you accept or reject your hypothesis accept we accepted it and tell us why because you ve got the evidence right there don t you the experiment like that one question we had it goes with the real world or something like that could you repeat this experiment the whole thing yeah or could anybody do this experiment yeah it s easy it is did you write your procedure so it s easy it s hard to write a procedure because it okay and if you had to do this experiment over again would you do it any differently or not no would you test for anything else good point how much pressure right okay alright any other questions nice job thanks jenni s team sorry to rush you guys but we got the idea what was your experiment our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk uses four different pairs of shoes like adidas converse or vans the adidas would go the farthest the vans no just show the data you were correct and you were correct because the adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116 6 centimeters we accepted our hypothesis jenni continue this why me because you re professional well we were going to do an interview but we forgot to so what do we do it s really bad why do you think it s bad jenni i don t know esta bien esta bien well here s the amount of distance and here s the kind of and i marked them as the average they all went so we can see that the adidas went more than the vans did because the vans were like the lowest will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again oh yeah well it s because jose did half of the experiment he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and i think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry so i think that affected the experiment there s probably different traction on shoes si simon what kind of shoe would you try next time a boot oh like my major walking boot si alright what would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot if you look at the well because it s soft so i think it ll go farther possibly go farther okay alright that would be interesting to try out does everybody see how this can apply to real life tienen preguntas hablan en ingles no espanol can you explain how this would apply to real life if you aren t just moon walking jose jenni don t look at me i don t know go on the actual moon gym class yeah gym class does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class sometimes okay some people do i don t you don t yeah like these shoes they slide a lot like in the gym okay so it might be different shoes for different jobs yeah okay well thank you nice job good we have time for our last presentation thank you alright sorry to rush everybody i know you could talk more about it thanks for being a good audience hello class how are we doing today good so our title was dirty water versus clean water thank you our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water,0.0
please freeze for a moment gentlemen what did you think about your performance i wouldn t say terrible but were you accurately on pitch all of you no no like as soon as the ladies came in you were like whoo and then you forgot what you were singing okay so don t let them distract you they re trying they re trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off but hold firm men hold firm to your position all right let s try it again here we go sing noel sing noel noel noel lock it in sing noel sing noel noel noel two parts sing noel sing noel noel noel sing noel sing noel noel noel together sing we all noel the support sing we all noel two parts sing we all noel sing we all noel back to the beginning sing noel sing noel noel noel end song all right if you were going to give yourself a grade what would you give it alison as a class like out of a s and b s and c s yep i would give an a minus okay and why the minus what do you think we think need to improve the pitch was kind of off at some parts okay so there was maybe some pitch issues what about energy level it was okay but this but one of the things about african music is it is something that is like felt in their soul okay it is traditionally when you listen i mean they are just letting it you know when we see any of the performances or listen to any of the cds we ve listened to it s just very gut felt i feel like you re sing noel sing noel noel noel so this is so pretty yes we want sing noel sing noel noel noel especially on that sing we all noel that s me we re singing it s like you re telling people we are singing not sing i think we all noel okay so let s make sure that we re right there on that one more time see if you can get a little more weight to your sound i don t mean make it flat i just mean with more confidence more security more support okay here we go sing noel sing noel noel noel awesome sing noel sing noel noel noel two part sing noel sing noel noel noel sing noel sing noel noel noel support this sing we all noel sing we all noel sing we all noel sing we all noel sing noel sing noel noel noel good and stop there so you get the idea that was awesome did you hear the difference yeah awesome i love that you challenged yourselves you pushed yourselves there it s hot those notes are kind of high i know that and you just pushed right through it so good job let s review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time so i m going to come here so we can do our body percussion real quick we are going to start with our bass part ladies and gentlemen we are not going to use these right now because traditional african music is by rote meaning you learn it by hearing you learn it by doing if you are a visual learner these are our music stands by the instruments so this will help you and you know i want everyone to be successful so you use the tools that will help you be successful you be an independent learner where you decide if this is what you need grab a music stand okay if you don t you don t need it okay so there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick okay so basses first let s all kind of scoot over this way so bass section first we have starting with your left hand sing oh sing oh sing noel sing oh sing oh sing noel and you have that crossover sing oh sing oh sing noel everybody feel comfortable with that any questions you look good you look like you have it all right then we have the xylophones this one s a tricky one so we have for that part let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time so we have sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it okay so the trickiest part is how many g s all right so remember we have low c and high c so you have c c c c c c and there s four gs over that syncopated rhythm g g g g f e d okay so it s kind of like one two three down the ladder you go okay so let s try that c c c c c c g g g g f e d c c c c c c g g g g f e d got it got the idea all right then we go on to the glockenspiels and for that one we can just clap that rhythm because i think on the instruments it will be easier to see to show because they re so obviously a little so it s not really like that so here we go it goes sing oh yes sing noel noel sing oh yes sing noel noel sing oh yes sing noel noel okay got the idea for that rhythm so i will come over and help that section and some of you may remember that from last time then we have our percussion section okay we have first the conga drum a real quick review on conga drum playing everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you if we can kind of spin back here so i can show you when you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit and scoot over that way there we go so when you play conga drum you actually are going to hold it in between your legs and put your feet around the base and you re going to tip it out from you so that that way the sound can come out but you also have the correct play style remember pat on the ends when you re playing and those are in you can pat this on your lap as well right now practice on your fingers okay so here s on this practice with a good technique right now ready go this is the part of the conga drum all right you ve got the idea and that goes over and over each measure then we have the log drum and the log drum and again the parts are right here on the stand if you need them you re going to have one side you re going to play sing so basically and it doesn t matter with those sing noel sing noel sing noel okay so you can clap that real quick sing noel sing noel sing noel sing okay see how it fits hello welcome thank you very much all right so next we are going to have this part which is traditional african bell and this one you have rest rest rest noel sorry hi to low so it s rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel rest can you snap it noel rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel and you can try it rest rest rest hi and fast noel rest get them up noel rest rest rest noel yes ladies and gentleman i m always spot checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we re doing this it s really important that i see that participation because then when we go to pick parts i m looking to see who has it yes there s choice but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing okay so let s try it again ready go rest rest rest rest rest rest rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel you got it and then i love these shakers you are the pulse you are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song so it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together so again really important we might add in some other more african instruments they re kind of loud so we ll see if you can get the correct sound so what i d like you to do now do you have any question all right if you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time i would challenge you to maybe pick a different one okay if you were still working on it you re welcome to stay there but without any payoffs so just kind of selection i would like you all to go and pick an instrument part remember we have glockenspiels basses xylophones and percussion so open two glockenspiels open and a bunch of xylophones open who was there first who was there first between you and ellen i was here you were there okay so if you want to join the glockenspiels you can do that you can go to xylophones oh nobody s up to the challenge all right once you get there you can start practicing all right hold up everybody all right thank you since we re trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually if you have the green mallets would you especially for you guys switch them out with the felt mallets instead so here s a set well you need those for that as well so we have one there should be another one in there oh here right here nope those are green you don t want those oh here s another one right here here here you go here s a set that s awesome thank you because that s just going to make it a lot softer and not quite as angry sounding all right so let s listen to each part so you can know what you re listening for remember when you are playing in an ensemble like this if you can t hear the other parts what does that tell you you re playing too loud yes you re playing too loud and remember again texture is everything we want to be able to pull out the different parts so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that but for right now let s make sure that we can keep it soft okay it s not a competition all right no one s going to win it s the whole class that we re trying to do this together so if we hear bass part first and let s go ahead and add at least shaker for right now and then we ll build in one or two sections one two ready go okay time out so you re listening for the beat she s watching me instead of the basses right because you re doing their work a little bit and you need to keep it nice and steady what happened we ended up with three different tempos did you hear that one two ready go okay pretty good and then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are okay one thing that will help is adding the singing to it okay,0.0
dakota didn t want to bring his because it s all broken well we can still look at it go get it honey actually hannah bring dakota s petroglyph over please yeah that s the thing with clay it breaks very easily okay all right will you still be able to tell us about it he said that it exploded please don t break it any more are you going to be able to talk about it still you can tell us what was on it okay put it down addy or it s going to break okay so you guys you did your small group was washoe and you re going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after the whole group the whole classroom okay okay so what i need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found and the four things that i want you to make sure somebody knows something about food shelter clothing and location but if you found something else you want to talk about go ahead so anybody chime in okay i think i know where they re located can you tell us south lake tahoe i know what they ate in your strong voice though they ate onions they ate wild potatoes wild carrots i think a little bit wild mustard sunflower seeds wild carrots wild potatoes wild strawberries raspberries wild gooseberries wild rosehips wild rhubarb pine nuts and they used sweet potatoes wild turnips wild spinach seeds okay do you think we re good on food yeah okay i think olivia got the part well we ll talk about that after so we have location shelter go ahead okay who s going to go next i have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes okay what do you have your information on i have clothing they used rabbit skins buckskins and plants okay and i m sorry coleman what did you say they used sticks and leaves to build their homes okay so you got those four covered any fun facts you guys found dakota what did you find out give us one fun fact in 1859 the washoe wait let dakota guys remember we re trying to be good listeners in 18 go ahead sweetie in 1859 the washoe had about 90 people times aw no no not 90 900 can i see what you wrote they had 90 000 or nine hundred nine hundred and now they only have 300 no let s see the population well i got it off the computer yeah i got 1500 in 1855 the washoe numbered about 900 but are now reduced to about a third of that number what that the same fact you had dakota yeah yeah very good thank you dakota i got in 2007 there was 1500 but i got it off the computer too and it said that well you know the computer is not always i got the latest what kind of data did you get like demographic or where did you get yours from i got it from google well guys 300 was what yours said dakota and yours said 1500 yeah are you sure yours wasn t 1500 from before and now it s 300 well it said in 2007 okay on here on my brain copy okay we might need to look at that some more you guys we ll look into that before we report on that but that would be a fun fact anyway joe did you tell us anything yeah i have another fun fact okay a fun fact their houses are called gadus gadus okay okay now who hasn t had a turn guys all of you got your hands up let s include our little friend addy okay they made baskets any good baskets mostly dot so la lee most famous one she was famous for making baskets what was she famous for olivia she was the she made the most baskets than other washoe people the other indians and why was she more famous than all the other indians i don t know that but i think she was like a really good basket maker you think she was a good can you scoot over i can yeah okay did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets yes did you know that they re in very oh you have a picture awesome these are actually dot so la lee s baskets mm hmm okay so the thing if you every get to see one of dot so la lee s baskets they re woven so tight you could carry water in them and we talked about symmetry today in math they re perfectly symmetrical yes they re woven so tight that you can put water in them and even dot so la lee had like 2000 you what she had made that many baskets she made how many a lot two thousand two hundred and something wow it would be nice to have one of those now huh yeah but they re like you can t even buy them you cannot buy them huh they re like in a museum they re in museums but i think some people do have a private collection of them really maybe one or two yeah they re not like our petroglyphs that we re going to talk about can you have a petroglyph in your private collection no those you can t have okay so you guys let s see who wants to be the writer do you have a pencil grab that pencil would you write your tribal name up here you guys are washoe and then go around addy and find out write the name of the person next to the food the shelter and that s what you re going to kind of be responsible for let s get addy and you can go around and ask each person or you can say who wants to do food w a s h o e i ll do fun facts i ll do shelter i ll do fun facts no i ll do shelter okay how are we going to decide joe should do the clothing joe should do clothing is that okay with you do you think i should tell you the name of the hold on we re not doing these we ll do that later thank you olivia olivia volunteered for food joe do you really want to do clothing i was either going to do clothing or language because i found a whole thing for everybody can do a fun fact too but i was going to do a fun facts we need somebody to do food and location okay i ll do location shelter shelter and location i got i ll get shelter good thank you coleman and then i know you guys want to do fun facts too so everybody can do a fun fact l e and then m a n c o l e m a n l e l e m a n okay now we just have location left but what s dakota doing what do you want to do how about me and dakota will do location together does that work okay that s who s going to do the fun fact everyone can do a fun fact so write thomas dakota for location no don t worry about fun facts everybody has got a fun fact right there so if both of you are doing it it s got to be super duper okay so we re going to look up if they lived in washoe they probably did did you have their names down addy it s like washoe people where are you guys going to find the information dakota and dakota d a k o t a better you guys what did we find out about google maybe you want to find two if you have two things and they don t say the same thing you might want to check another one there s a lot of maps on google there s a lot of maps on google yeah we re going to go we re going to go on maps and look where okay thanks i m going to take that so when you okay so next week or the week after you guys are going to do a whole group class presentation on your tribe and you re welcome to bring pictures or artifacts or like pieces of whatever if you want to do that you can bring a basket obviously it s not going to be a dot so la lee can i bring a arrowhead did your tribe have arrowheads yeah okay now looking in front of you you guys for our art project we did something what is this called who knows olivia i like how you raised your hand the petrograph louder petro the petrograph petroglyphs and what is a petroglyph you re going to break yours thomas addy what s a petroglyph it s a carving in a rock a carving in a rock did your tribe make petroglyphs we don t know why don t you know cuz they put things like right down they made it they just moved they just carved it in and nobody really knows unless there s someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down generation to generation yes very good what were you going to say you know when we were looking on that website we were looking on that website and one said washoe okay yes so some of them they attri they say that they did it but we don t know who did what petroglyphs but in our state can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably and maybe if they found petroglyphs where your location was you could say those were shoshone petroglyphs would that work we re washoe washoe i m sorry all right so who wants to share theirs first so what you re going to do is you re going to share it and show the whole group and tell us what yours meant to you okay okay addy you want to call on somebody since everybody is dying to talk who s going first coleman coleman can we see yours okay i want to zoom in on it hold it up a little bit because i got it up okay what does yours mean to you it means that it s night and there s some stars and there s a duck and then there s a canoe on the water and there is a lot of meat and camping camping okay anybody else want to go pass it around joseph oh don t pass it around we don t want to break it we re going to stick them on wood or something oh let me get a picture oh i m zooming in up higher joe because i ve got this on a tripod okay all right mine is we re going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top and there s a snake trying to eat the duck there s an eagle it s daytime and the skies are clear oh addy you re calling on people thank you okay addy sit back a little bit so we can see miss olivia random things but i think i know what it is it means they re hunting buffalo at night and then the daytime came and it s all rainbow and we caught some fish that s it okay good who wants to go now thomas nice so there s a camp and there s a little hill behind the camp and there s people in war and there s a snake and then one person is not in war he s just trying to shoot a duck but then the other guy shot him and then there s and this has been happening for three days okay dakota mine kind of blew up here mine kind of blew what happened to yours honey it like kind of didn t turn out so well it like blew up in pieces can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces well it was like i don t know did you have like hunting symbols or anything no he just did like squares i drew lines because i i remember i didn t really know what to write you didn t know what to write okay that s all right but if you could do it again what would you do what would it mean to you i d probably make up a war thing a war thing okay it s more war except hunt hunting oh okay did you go miss addy okay humans were hunting for humans that s what s on mine okay addy i would wait until everybody was listening thank you i can t show your okay just show the other children it s a sunny day a snake is trying to eat the fish the fish are in the river cool what s the little zigzag mountains oh those are mountains oh cool sun snake river just fishing just fishing so what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe what would have been your tribe only baskets we could have maybe tried to weave something what else basket but that wouldn t be too fun in our project like we could pretend that we were real,0.0
you re going to test and be coming up here for materials okay go you just follow the lines if no if the lines if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper the termites will follow the lines we should draw like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow and we ll make it like this well it s not going to be on a circle it can be like this and see if they ll follow that circle yeah would that be a good may i bother you with this i m just covering them up what are you saying yeah well beside this one if termites we ll place on a red piece on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines then the termites will follow the lines in the circle okay so you re going to use the color red line again what color paper would you use white white paper yeah and i think since we ve already used colored paper i think that s a result of that well again you could do yours and yours and tie them together use different colored papers so what s the point of your test that depending on the colored paper we ll determine what the termites sight can do i would think it s the color of the line because that s what they re following so you think they re following the color of the line yes yeah but when they went to the end of the white paper they went to the black and they came right back well no that s because they knew what it was that s because i like kept hitting them back okay so you re kind of going along with the idea of color how could you prove that color was that color effects their you draw a bunch of different circles draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size but of different colors and see which one they go to i like that nice okay on a white piece of paper yeah again i ve got colored paper the more tests you do the more accurate your results would be all right so let s do the same test but on two different types of paper so if termites are placed on a white piece of paper put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out no that down good and there you go so what were we thinking about testing um putting tables in line using different color and to see if we re not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around oh very nice yeah because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down they followed it down tricky okay they went it s true so they didn t follow this part yeah because it curves no because they we drew the circle they go like then they curve and go down and they came here and went back up they all followed hmm interesting thank you four you ve got about two more about a minute and a half actually what are we thinking i m going to go ahead and cover these up we were planning on doing um like we think they re attracted to the ink and i m going to test it with like a marker a pen and a crayon okay to see if like if they follow the ink better than the other ones nice would you use the same color of ink yeah because it would be the control there you go very nice um what color paper are you going to use should we use regular white i would say white yeah all right good okay sounds good where are your termites stop playing with them and we re going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out what were you guys thinking about testing mainly if they are going to follow the red line then they must be attracted to red they must be attracted to what red red okay so how could you test that they are just attracted to red we re going to make two large circles two large circles and some other lines and some other lines but what are you testing again if they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red okay so you re talking about the color red um would you use so you tell me what you re going to set up i m trying to follow probably just a black one and a red one lines or circles circles circles okay all right yeah basically just for fun okay okay just for fun all right um you should be collecting materials if pens and things aren t working let me know dude get the line what happened to your situations well we put tape over this and now it doesn t follow it over here i think they like the color red none of them are following any of these lines how could you continue to test that they like the color red put more red over here i mean we also put the tape there and it doesn t like the tape it gets confused and we have the red paper and it didn t follow the black lines or the pencil yeah that s what i mean none of them here are even doing anything they get tired and just start standing there twitching do you need some new ones no there are still pretty lively yeah so what are some of the conclusions that you re thinking oh terrance be sweet ah be sweet ah white on red they only like that also they only follow that type of pen they don t follow any other type of pen or pencil um they don t necessarily have an affiliation to red okay how do you know that cause they walked off the red paper okay they walked off the red paper so you threw that one out how could you continue to say that they like that particular pen and not having to do red we tried black pen we haven t tried another color on white yet see look it stopped at the tape it s confused at the tape no neal what i asked you is that a pen or a marker it s a pen it s a pen oh he s following the other we drew it on the other side we drew a circle on the other side it looked like he was following it is it something inside of them no like what the ink s made out of how could you test that using the red pen on this okay taking two different pens go grab some more that s a good idea red color pen red color pencil you killed the ant gentlemen be nice to your termites oh oh wait wait here neal let s get all right group here s a red pen colored pencil oh look that one s alive okay now then so what are you saying is going on they re still following the red one yeah they re still following the red pen so it s not necessarily an affiliation to the color red so it is something inside the ink so how can you test if it s something inside the ink i just got the other colored pencil take another red pen go grab some it s right there that s a pencil it s the color red look stick with the no you just threw out the idea that it s red stick with the color stick with the pen idea we need a pen like this no i think we have the exact same pen no no the blue one like this they have a blue one like that go see there s blue pens up there hey can we borrow a red pen i meant blue you know what i meant bam it s a different type of pen it s all right different type of pen but it s blue now did you get a blue one no i just got red ones i got bundles nice now they re going to follow it now i thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen i think it s that pen i ve got the same pen they re still the red i think they are okay try that one there s a hole there by the way if you press through it it will break go are you going to make it intercept the line yeah i m going to oh look he s following the little one maybe it likes circles wait wait i still think it s something inside the ink draw a square see if it follows a square so that would be able you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square so draw a square see what happens yeah draw a square i ve got another black pen i have all these pens why not draw the square inside of there inscribe the square in the circle terms terminology you re a professor now oh it s following it it is the pen curves are easier it didn t know where the line was okay five four um we drew different lines in the different types of pens markers colored pencils did you do it all on the same page or on different pages on different colored pages why would you do it on different colored pages ah to make sure the tests varied okay did you use the same color of ink on each page describe to me your experiment web the whole group can chime in too um like we drew like a black circle on a black sheet of paper okay to see if they could only like please don t be rude black circle on a black sheet of paper keep going what else and that didn t work they could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that christian came up with that take a white piece of paper and we drew like every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles none of the other colors what were the blue and the red circles drawn with i believe different types of stuff mainly pen though and this was all on one sheet of paper well we tried it on different sheets too okay that s what started us off okay um did you have it all on one sheet at first yeah okay what did you realize was wrong with that they were pretty much getting confused as in we re going to have issues with what maintaining a control a control good only one independent variable nice um nick s group how did you go through the indentation we drew several circles using each of the utensils and then i think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of if they weren t in the middle sort of eating off of the wood or like just exploring around they were following the pen okay um your indentation line did you draw that with just pens different types of pens did you draw it with markers did you draw it with a paper clip we just used the same color but we used different things like we used pens vis a vis colored pencils stuff like that okay and what was your conclusion with that they followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation because they came the termites into that line because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop and i figured oh well they must be blind because they can t see that there s a drop there interesting point why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation instead of a pen because it wouldn t have shown a color but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen okay so any components within that pen color chemicals type of pen whatever if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation you would have been able to do what pen verses paper clip pen would have looked i think it would have looked the paper clip would have looked deeper but the thing is like would it prove if you had it or not had what or not if they followed the dent or not not just like the color or the like smell or whatever very good very good so by using the paper clip to create the indentation they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent maybe the scent from the pen the chemical from the pen that left the indent by doing the paper clip just by itself we would have been able to say okay that obviously doesn t leave any chemicals it doesn t leave any color and if they re following that indentation we know that that s what they are drawn too okay carly your group had an interesting set up um we well we kind of did two all right but the first one we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with like white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper and that didn t really work so we did the other one and um with like the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper and they only went on the red pen one okay what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described as in something that might have thrown off the results paper i don t know well notice in one of the experiments you used a what to create the circle the pen okay you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what paper but you used a oh white yeah you used a white colored pencil so by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil what are those two things now added on what variables added on variables okay for one you re using pen and pencil another you re using colors so how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables gentlemen calm down we could have used colored pencils the whole time okay could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time good um what group haven t i talked to matthew explain to us the set up of your group do you want to start i don t know what to say oh okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it so we decided maybe it s not color so we took a black pen a big one um we took a black pen and then two red pens of different type and two blue pens of different type and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue it was the bic pens so we decided there must be something in that in the chemical structure of that ink that s you know similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort um and the termites followed it okay um did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday yeah after school that was extracurricular all right so but we figured out the bic pens we figured that out okay good excellent set up there were there any variables that when i was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens you got this yeah we were drawing with different shapes cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing so we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it and they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape it might be in the pen or the color they don t really like sharp angles though we drew a square and they got lost yeah they couldn t find the angle okay interesting so um if any of you did do any sort of research you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit and we learned that those were what pheromones enzymes enzymes not enzymes what are pheromones having to do with we just spent three days on it animal behavior animal behavior communication their chemical signals okay so we learned that termites emit these pheromones we might have encountered this last time and that s the same thing why ants follow a specific trail um when honeybees sense danger they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out that danger s coming but the pheromone that termite s emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen in bic and papermate pens actually mimics the chemical in the pheromones which is why they followed certain pens,0.0
just take it in but take your tube off first before you pull it out before you pull the needle out take your vacutainer tube off and this is pull it out again yeah use your two by two remember oh yeah there you go good job faye and guys it just takes a while this is not something you re going to learn overnight this is a skill that it takes a little while to learn you ve got to get hand movements down you ve got to figure out what works best for you you know if you need things placed in a different position but after this you all can start sticking the arms when you re not doing your book work then whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down you feel like you re proficient then i ll watch you which i ll watch you doing then you all will stick me so what do you think cassie hmm what do you think is it easier than you thought or harder than you thought easier yay faye those arms are a little harder to get those veins are not as easy to feel as that s okay she s doing a fine job two by two sorry you to draw blood from them pop your tourniquet engage your safety good job from down there yeah they say not to use these and you can use hand veins but remember first choice second choice last choice and then hand veins if you re going to do hand veins you all have been through a lot of the book work already if you re going to use hand veins what kind of needle are you going to use butterfly butterfly okay i know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic you guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab we ll do it at dr maderis clinic so that you all can get more sticks there is there some people who draw only from around here not usually now there are some people they ll come in and they ll say you can t get blood from anywhere from me except here what that one lady told you is right here right i m better at popping it out remember i couldn t get it in good it will be something that after you get these hand movements down it ll just happen because when i m not talking while i m doing it i mean it just flows because i have done it for several years but for some reason after you get older it s hard to talk and do something at the same time that s what we re going to do today is you all are going to learn how to draw blood you re going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they re called and each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you re ready to start drawing blood and i know that wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because guys when you get out there in the clinical area a lot of people don t follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws guys that are medical assisting you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor s office when you re there in the doctor s office it s just you and the person so you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don t get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn the first things i want to talk about is your vein choice and i printed off your veins and the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle you can see this one better yeah you see that one better your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from that s the one that runs little finger side and then your cephalic is on the thumb side so this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from and the reason that this is your last choice vein is there s quite a few nerves that are right underneath it so if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage and i will leave this on the table as y all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you re choosing your vein you can only advance or withdraw the needle only you cannot go sideways i know those of you who s already been in the clinical site you ve seen them go sideways you ve seen them come out and go back in and guys that could be a liability for you and you re the only one that can protect your patient and you i ve got the materials set up whenever we repeat this you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we ve got here because you ll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms when you go to clean your arm you re going to clean in a circular motion so i m going to go ahead and get started first thing you re going to do i don t need your gloves just the two hands first thing you re going to do is put on your gloves i just washed my hands but i m going to put on my gloves and why do i want to do that jim so i don t get infected yeah i don t want to come into contact with someone s blood now who could protect me from coming into contact with someone s blood yourself i m the only one that can do that and i can tell you from having my blood drawn people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn t know me from adam and one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them so i am the only one that can protect me if i see you practicing without your gloves on it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day if i see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on then we re going to have a big talk okay because you ve got to protect you i have a question with some people that you draw blood on do you have to wear a mask like an eyeshield type thing if they are on precautions then yes you would and you ve seen at the hospital on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation if you were to go into one of those rooms yes you would in the er when you draw blood you usually have on that splash mask now usually with a venipuncture you re not going to have that much pressure it s not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would but still it s better to err on the side of safety but also if there s nothing wrong with me except i need a cbc to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield i m going to think oh my gosh why is she doing that you know so make sure that it s appropriate if you re in a trauma area then yes definitely if you re in an outpatient clinic unless that patient tells you my veins squirt blood really bad a patient will tell you one time i was doing a finger stick and it squirted and i had on my glasses but i turned my head it hit me in the hair so sometimes the venous flow will do that good question cathy all right so got my gloves on first i m going to do is i m going to put the tourniquet on and guys the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it and you re going to put it underneath the arm you need to make sure it s tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you re going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you re going to cause petechiae which is little red patches on the arm i m going to cross my hands over what i do is i put my left hand in position i take my right hand get ahold of the tail of this pull it and then i stick it underneath with my little finger you always want your tails up toward the top so they re not in your area where you re going to clean and draw when i m going to clean well let me show you how to feel first well it s not going to cooperate today you can use my arm that way they can see better can you move the sharps container i m going to stick it underneath there and now it should stay on there now to locate a vein i m going to take my index finger and i m going to feel back and forth and guys you all can do this on each other jim s excellent to feel veins on and he s a real good volunteer bounce back and forth it feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there if it feels really hard like i have one that i ll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard you re not going to get blood out of it it s got to be it s got to bounce so when you go across and you find it then you re going to find which way it travels so you re going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight so i found my vein now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute has my tourniquet been on about a minute probably so so i need to take the tourniquet off give this patient s arm a rest and then i can talk to them about the weather i can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time and then i m ready to draw blood now so i come in here i put my tourniquet on and guys when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute and i m going to clean i m going to clean in a circular motion and then if you re having trouble with the alcohol you re not able to fan it you can t blow on it and you can take one very clean 2 by 2 go straight down dry it off and then many of you already did that this part of the needle this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it you screw that in take the end off this is a safety needle you anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle that is the pointy part the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin i pull my thumb away as i m going in i take one of these vacutainer tubes thank you jim and i push it in and guys when i push in with my thumb i m pulling back with my fingers and you re not able to see but there is and i don t do this in the clinical side but there is blood coming in there you let it fill until it stops now it s stopped flowing i m going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle the less it s going to hurt the patient pop my tourniquet and i m going to take a different 2 by 2 than what i cleaned with fold it lay it on the arm and guys i m just going to kind of hover there until i bring the needle out and push down if i push down while the needle is in the arm it hurts really bad and i m going to hold here and i m going to hold until it quits bleeding and you can peek now if the blood oh sticky needle engaged it s hard to talk and do stuff at the same time isn t it sharps and you toss that in the sharps now if this patient is on blood thinners i ve got to hold longer a lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there put a coband on them and send them on their way if they bleed out outside of the lab you re liable and again you re the only one that can protect you so i make sure that they ve stopped bleeding and now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full you guys have been observing can we ask them to hold it well you can but what if they don t hold it tight enough what if there s a whole lobby full jim what have you seen them do in the past and check yeah you need to check it if there s a whole lobby full sitting out there then you ll get to them when you get to them because you ve got to protect your phlebotomy certificate you re the only that can do that a lot of places they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there tell the patient to hold their arm up that breaks platelets that s going to make a huge bruise and it doesn t really help with the clotting that much just kind of bruises so we re going to look here okay this patient has quit bleeding so i am good to go here now another lesson i will teach you about writing on the vials the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there so before you all draw let me ask you a few questions what s your first choice vein median median okay and why do we avoid the basilic nicole nerves and tendons nerves okay what can happen if i powder on the shirt what can happen if i dig around in there and i do injure somebody what can they do they can bleed or they can have their nerve damage right and they can come and say this phlebotomist drew here and then guys if you re ever in a setting where you have to go to court they re going to call somebody that s a phlebotomist like you are and they re going to ask them what s your first choice vein and they re going to say the median and they re going to say what s your next choice what s your last choice so you re going to have somebody there that knows you really don t want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice okay what can happen if the patient s on blood thinners cassie what s the most important thing to remember about the patient that s on blood thinners to keep pressure to keep pressure okay how do you clean your site martika in a circular outward motion circular you don t ever go back over and how long do you leave the tourniquet on faye one minute one minute good job okay you all get your first thing you do is what gloves get your gloves on so you all are going to draw with drawing blood are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to i would if i were you because that just protects you so you can write median you can write an mc median cubital and that way you may actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw and that way they know that you drew from the median that you didn t draw from basilic i need another needle okay anybody else need another needle thank you you re welcome i m going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody feel their veins feel all the different types of veins some people have garden hoses is what i call them some people have very large veins and feel for your vein the tourniquet pinched my thumb the gloves are hard to you trading them out it s this arm jim i think because i had trouble getting it when i was doing it too okay just make it a little tighter with your oh did you stick yourself mm mm okay i screwed the wrong part i think she s bleeding and i haven t even done anything yet oh yeah hand me another one there it goes again okay casey let me see what i can do for you good job martika want to just chill how s the weather blah blah blah blah is it not come undone now you might want to pull your tail just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails it ll stay down okay it s moving again you re kidding see okay just keep going okay just keep going it s easier on a person that s my stomach jim it s hungry sorry yeah this one jim knows which ones stay better okay you got to anchor your vein with your non dominant with your non dominant hand you anchor your vein i have to stand i can t see you take your thumb and you pull down here anchor your vein there you go casey are you left handed too mm mm i thought you said non dominant hand non dominant hand to anchor back it out put it in this hand are you right handed mm hmm put non dominant hand thumb there anchor okay now did you clean it yep okay then go in uh oh it s okay it s okay well that s okay put that on start over a lot of this is hand movement a lot of this is prac,0.0
okay guys i see we ll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication okay so can you read the objective with me please so i i will be able to do fraction multiplication okay i ve also put it in spanish just in case that helps you okay so the first thing i want to discuss with you today is what do you think about that do you agree or disagree and then why so one half does one half equal one half why or why not and then give me some examples okay raul it s becuase it is one half they re the same okay abraham it s like you cut a pear in half it s gonna be in equal parts okay so you guys are saying it s equal yes okay what do you think eddie believes he thinks the same thing taleah what do you think i think it s the same you think it s the same does everyone think it s the same i do until you think why wouldn t it be the same okay so jose is saying why wouldn t they be the same okay so one thing jose says is he s trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn t be the same joe it s not the same because no that s just the board point is there a times nope it s just one over two equals one over two i was thinking it was a half times a half okay so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it s the same right yeah so now how do you explain to me why you think it s the same why you think it s the same joe because they have equal parts okay equal parts what do you mean by equal parts they have the same fraction okay jose they re both practically the same thing what do you mean by practically the same thing that once you cut a square in half you have equal parts and they re gonna be the same thing okay who is someone we haven t heard from madeline what do you think so i heard you say they are the same right yeah so why do you think they are the same cause they re both equal parts and the same cause half equals a half okay antonio what do you think think it s the same so sounds like we re all thinking it s the same okay abraham what do you think i think they equal the same thing equals the same thing okay so now let s take a look at maybe cause it sounds like we re all on the same path here so let s take a look at something else are they really the same is that half of a cookie cookie half of a cookie half a pizza are they the same no yes one at a time cause i m hearing a lot of good stuff but you guys are all saying it at the same time okay miguel they re the same cause if they weren t the same is just half so i m hearing they re the same but one s bigger than the other one cause one s a pizza and one s a cookie yeah tina you re kind of shaking your head what do you think about that i think they re both the same cause they re still one half they are just different size victoria what do you think same or not the same same cause it s still half okay so let me ask you this i m hearing a couple things and it s kind of contradicting itself meaning you re saying one thing but you re also saying the opposite like i heard it s the same because it s one half but it s different because it s different sizes different sizes you just told me it s the same but now you re telling me it s different sizes they are both fattening oh cookies and pizza are both fattening okay felice why i think they re still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it s big or small because it s still chopped in half okay so if a half of a half so would you rather have half of 10 or half of 100 half of a 100 why because it s bigger because it s bigger but i thought it was the same no no cause it s the same thing it s still half but you re commenting half of a hundred it has to be the same thing like the pizza a whole pizza and you cut it in half okay you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen for it to be half for it to be half but here it s not the same thing you re saying to me that it is equal so which is it so now you re saying you don t think they re the same no you get more pieces than a cookie they re still the same they re still half okay so who still agrees that the one half equals one half raise your hand okay alright now who says that one half maybe sometimes doesn t equal one half okay so we got a couple alright so delphina what s your thinking i haven t heard from you what s your thinking i think it depends on what you are looking at so in case you didn t hear her delphina said it depends okay hear what she said it depends on what you re looking at cause she said with the money example that you guys well all of you unanimously chose half of a hundred that s 50 as opposed to 5 half of 10 so it does matter so now we just go back to the question does one half equal one half okay raul i think one half equals one half i think it s still the same it s not talking about how big it is it s just talking about a half but it didn t say in the question what it was i think the question is supposed to say what it was to say if it s the same or not okay so what dallas is saying what dallas is saying that it needs to tell you what one half is cause she s saying here the previous question just had the number one over two one over two equal alright here she s saying well all of a sudden yeah the numbers are gone but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie so now it s not the same but it s the same question what dallas is saying in the question it should tell you what is it it s actually like 10 fives five tenths and and one half so what do you think what s your final thought as far as one half equals one half what s your final thought they re still the same it s a half it s still the same because it s half okay it s the same and different it s the same and different miguel and they tell you it s different okay so good question good question i like the look of that yes if they are are they the same they re the same it s one half or something one is bigger than the other one okay rodrigo what about you bud what s your thoughts on this i m still thinking you re still thinking or are you still will you compete i m still basically undecided okay you think they re basically the same so you added that basically why don t you just put they re the same why did you put basically because one s bigger than the other it will obviously still be different where we re going with this is you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is your whole unit okay alright so that s why sometimes you have to be careful what it s asking you to do okay let s go on to the next one okay so what does one half look like to you so just think right now in your head when you think of one half okay what do you see half a dollar half of a dollar half a fifty half a fifty half a gallon of juice half a gallon of juice half a body half of a body half of a cake half of a cake okay guadalupe what do you see half a paper half a paper okay so let me take it to the next step so what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice does it make sense no does it make sense no it doesn t make sense so we have to make sure that we know what you have to make sense well it makes sense but how is it gonna make sense it s what if they re the same if they re the same but what s the same the object the object or the whole unit right like what is it we re talking about we talking about pizza we talking about cookies paper paper juice people people eggs alright so the other thing i wanna talk to you about is does multiplication always make things larger bigger yes no so i heard yes yes yes and then no so now then what cause sometimes it makes it smaller if you do nine times one it s gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero it makes it zero jessie did you hear her example no okay so what she said was cause it s important i want you to make sure you understood she said that no because nine times one is nine then when you go nine times zero it s zero so it actually made it less right what do you think though when you multiply in general when you multiply does it make things larger when you multiply two things together yes okay abraham it gets bigger because like six times two it s 12 and it gets bigger okay raul what do you think raul v when you multiply does it always get bigger it depends on the number what it depends on the number it depends on the number so give me an example zero times 8100 is gonna be zero okay so can we so i m hearing kind of like a lot of you are saying yes it makes it larger but there s still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always like if we go back to if we go back to that one half if we go back to that one half and that dollar gino what s 100 times one half times one half is a hundred and a half a hundred and a half 50 50 i got 150 150 taylor do you agree one hundred times one half is 150 raul b 500 five hundred how d you get five hundred i thought it was half of a thousand a hundred though no more thousand one hundred one hundred times one half is it 110 half of 10 is five half of 10 is five so what is your answer the one hundred times one half five hundred five hundred okay so one hundred times one half is five hundred tina we don t know because we don t know what one half equals okay so tina s saying now you don t know what the one half is what if we re just talking about numbers one hundred times one half what would that be one hundred times one half let s say it s money a hundred dollars times one half it could be five or 50 if we re talking about 100 then it s gonna be one half of 100 is 35 okay so 45 there was a lot of people talking so you couldn t hear but louis is saying it depends but if you re talking about money if it was hundred dollars times one half it d be half of 100 which is 50 let s take that example one hundred times one half is 50 so then when we multiply that did it get larger no yeah it got smaller didn t it you start with a hundred and you multiply and you got 50 which is less so what do you think now do you think it always makes things bigger no sometimes it makes it smaller so let s can you give me another example then that s just make sure we prove it is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then like five times four five times four we start with five times four you get what 20 it s a bigger number okay so that s if you multiply it times a half right ten times one half ten times one half would be five raise your hand if you think it doesn t always make it bigger it depends on what you multiply it by alright very good so we re gonna use the area model to show one half times one half that s a whole one half times one half abraham says it s a whole but let s go ahead and let s take a look i m gonna go ahead and shade in one half okay and then we ll take a look to see what it actually equals here s a half there s a half how many squares are shaded both colors one two one out of how many total four one fourth so one half times one half is one fourth is one fourth smaller than one half yes that s another proof that when you multiply it doesn t always get bigger you could make it into money like one fourth is 25 cents alright very good a hundred divided by so let s take a look at another example if we re to use an area models for this what would that look like three fourth it d be one half right we d see one half times one fourth so what do you think half of a fourth one eighth half of a fourth which is one eighth he said one half of one fourth is one eighth do you agree yeah okay,0.0
okay so tell us a little background about ed alright well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious okay so because of his complaining of chest pains be subtle from conscious or no he called and he talked to the paramedics but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well how do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition generally it can clog your arteries what can clog your arteries the fat that builds up okay from being obese yeah okay is that one of the i guess physical signs that someone may have a heart condition yes okay okay alright go ahead it is also his blood pressure it said it s at variable levels so that means his heart isn t working properly or consistently so that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system it could damage it it s also another sign of a heart attack okay so the variable heart or actually the variable blood pressure and some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research you were wondering what did this variable mean and i think what you said is exactly right it s not normal okay they state the variable meaning it wasn t working how it should okay so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history so tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let s say you ranked who was your number hmm who was your second who proceeded him nelson nelson so you got ed ranked over nelson where some other people had nelson ranked number one so what do you think well he s unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately and since his heart attacks aren t his title he needs it i think it s important to see to get treatment to get medical care yeah okay if he doesn t get treatment what do you think could happen probably he ll die from the heart attack if he doesn t get treatment or paralyzed what do you mean by paralysis why do you think he could become paralyzed i m not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not okay you re not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis yeah anybody like to comment on that question go ahead jordan it s a stroke it has a brain clot and then that will cause partial i can t say it paralysis yeah that word but heart attack you could have a heart attack after that using different parts not paralysis good point so jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis what system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis what system in our body is that nervous system yeah nervous system okay understand doban jake got that alright so you guys have ed you ranked him number one and then you ranked nelson number two along with quite a few other people it looks like we have some consistencies there let s look at group b you had nelson ranked number one but then you did have ed ranked number three so you didn t think ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to nelson and or monique well nelson and monique had the most critical vital signs they seemed the most the worst because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic so they were not and they were dehydrated too when your body starts to dehydrate that s not it really messes up all your systems so they were what systems cardiovascular system the respiratory system the immune system everything s just being attacked here because with eve let me see this his heart rate was way below normal and that s the cardiovascular system his temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon what s the normal body temperature for that of a human the normal temperature is 98 6 and he s at 109 he s at 109 folks okay i think this was one of our hypers if you remember nelson and monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital okay so he s at 109 isn t this like the immune system mmhmm yeah so that s the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down it s at 10 respirations per minute 10 respirations per minute and the normal s like 20 so he s down to half so i think that his vital signs were way more out of whack did you count in on the blood pressure the blood pressure it s really low and that means his circulatory system s not working right which means blood s not getting everywhere it needs to be which means he could end up having i don t actually know if it would lead to a stroke but like if everything s not getting blood everywhere his brain might not get enough blood he could have brain damage or something like that it s interesting she said stroke talking about nelson was nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms seizures it was seizures he was having seizures is that is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system absolutely think about all the systems you just named what s going on with nelson cardiac nervous circulatory immune dehydration entire bringing in dehydration digestive not enough water this guy is having a rough time isn t he so if you re pretty confident in why you ranked him number one yeah okay comments anybody well the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because monique yeah because she has a better chance of survival so you ranked him three and it s interesting you said we thought he was going to die he was maybe beyond that point of help yeah okay so why d you rank him three why not rank him seven well what if he has a shot he s got a chance yeah okay he has a chance over mark that wound to the chest yeah because mark got shot in the chest didn t he you d save him though it s interesting you said if he has a shot mark s the one that got shot he was more stable than nelson was though mark was mark was more stable yeah interesting you re bringing in the whole fact of now you re triaging it you re saying okay mark s a little bit more stable even though he s got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot we don t know what kind of gun it was but i feel like if you rank him a three he s at such a critical position that it s either you rank him one because he needs treatment right away or he s going to die okay so you re saying he s got to be one based upon all the symptoms based upon his vital signs the condition that he was brought in if you re not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die is that what you re saying or early on like you can t wait too long i guess you ve got to rank him one to three otherwise so he s like what group were you we re f you re f so you had him okay you had him at a two yeah okay alright so you re saying he s a top three yeah especially you had a hand up oh i was just agreeing with him if we thought we had any chance we should be like let s not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven okay good point brian well were were thinking speak up a little bit please well we were thinking that even though he s unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient but compared to like the other ones like albert or mark his symptoms weren t that of like great danger as the others and even though his body temperature was 109 that could have been because he was going through heat stroke but now that he s in asprins they re a cool environment you bring up heatstroke why do you think he s going through a heatstroke well i don t know because he was unconscious and they said he was dehydrated and everything well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like i also figured it d be heatstroke because his daughter monique yeah i m sorry monique it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as nelson was then it s more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she s going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it s most likely that he is too because they re both in the same environment very interesting i want to come back to this point ryan you ve got your hand up what were you going to say i was just going to say that monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke you re exactly right now my mind instantly goes somewhere here jordan your hand was up first i was just going to say that since their temperature s so high they re probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels so just putting them they re going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment or really cool compared to where they were if they ll put them into more shock which can also be fatal which means they re not exactly just because they re in a hospital doesn t mean they re necessarily going to get better right away okay obviously they need some treatment you don t want to go from one extreme to the other but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit yeah they need to get cooled down and what else do they need water water lots of water correct yes you can t really say that monique s symptoms can apply for albert too because monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting so that s probably what most of the symptoms are from we forgot about the bee sting it says she s dizzy nauseousness has cracked lips is having difficulty breathing has a rash on her legs and stomach okay she got stung by a bee like you were saying the reason we put monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee it shows here that with the difficulty breathing the bee sting her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or epipen getting what epipen you know what it is just say epipen epipen yeah epinephrine epinephrine yes it should elevate them in the largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like respiratory system is closing off she loses her breathing possibly absolutely she s having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here here s where my thought went and i said we d come back to this point maybe sean you were going to comment or somebody else they re both out in the wilderness this canyon they re both having heatstroke symptoms actually monique got stung by the bee she s having separate issues there you don t see anything else different about these two individuals sean one got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top do you think that would have a difference in their physical one gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what third of the way excellent point you know what s the other issue between these two jack you know well like they re both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke but monique got stung by a bee and at the same time nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms so it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off interesting interesting yes would it be their age age excellent look at the difference in their age how old s monique 18 yeah she s 18 nelson the dad right he s 51 i m not saying 51 is old but there s a big difference between 18 and 51 plus the fact you add in what sean said he s got to hike out of this canyon he s going to try to find help right is he having to expend a lot more energy yeah and he s got to go uphill he s go to go uphill yeah it s hot he s got no water he s got to go uphill he s losing basically control of his body no energy no water erin and that s why we had nelson as number one and then monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem but nelson was having it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything and monique she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee so it wasn t like so we put her close up to the top because there was she s already been waiting for long enough she needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon so they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they d been struggling long enough absolutely what during our discussion we were kind of using speak up a little bit sorry okay so during when we were discussing the age we were thinking also monique but which group were you real quick e you were e okay so like what we thought was that since monique is 18 years old verses nelson is a 51 year old well like it makes sense that monique has a stronger immune system because she s more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas nelson could be different but we don t know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure it doesn t show but i m just saying in general we were writing specific about his other health because i wrote that down age related diseases age related diseases yeah so we re missing some medical history yeah so it s possible there because he s older and because his immune system isn t as strong as monique s is we have to like or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter s absolutely as doctors medical history is so important it s so important in the triage process and we ve been through this folks you know you go to the doctor s office you go into the hospital you know in addition to while they re taking your vital signs what are they asking what are they asking when you go in medical history oswell have you had any previous stuff what s stuff mean like surgery so like problems okay other medical conditions yeah okay what s another question they ask very simple has it ever happened before has it happened before is it hereditary could it be hereditary what s your family s history and i think that s what brian you were relating to back there what are you here for today okay let s look back in the chart should i at this moment when he comes into the hospital he s obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped oh so you re asking about you re referring to nelson yeah because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon but because it s so low i would guess that he doesn t have a history of high blood pressure okay you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it blood pressure is obviously low i think we addressed this a second ago why do you think it s low sarah because everything else that s going on it s also affecting blood pressure yeah i think i truly believe with the limited amount of information we have i truly believe that because of the dehydration the heatstroke the no energy no nutrients i literally think this entire body all the systems shutting down shutting down i really do think that but it s a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure s 85 over 50 does anybody has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before okay 85 over 50 that s low i mean that gets to borderline point where you know you re dizzy i mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system it s not high enough i mean that gets borderline with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up i think his body s just shutting down and you bring up a good point but i think in this case just with everything else going on i think his body s just shutting down okay honestly on the side of that besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help during the scenario that he s in high blood pressure like with it s problems that it could cause with it s possible weakens the heart could have actually killed him during the long extended time of trying to get to the paramedics that was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people that this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without and plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there s no possible low levels that could even cause problems true yeah blythe like on the graphs i feel like there s nelson his blood pressure and the blood pressure of elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas nelson was 85 over 50 but we just talked about how like nelson s blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be but with elder he has a head injury and,0.0
today i m going to introduce to you our new project and it s based on the concept of surrealism when you look at this word you should recognize a smaller word within it does anyone recognize the smaller word real real that s right the word real and we know real is the way things really look when we see them or the way they appear but the word sur transforms that word and because this is a french word sur means beyond so now what the word surrealism implies is beyond reality or the way things really appear so what does that look like it looks very dreamlike it doesn t necessarily make sense a lot of different things go on in surrealism and i m going to show you a few examples right now these are the three characteristics that we re going to focus on the first characteristic is out of place objects if you look at this example up here what s out of place in this picture can anyone tell me trevor the guy s face what s over his face just floating there can anyone tell you re up close matthew you see what that is an apple it s a green apple okay and that is an out of place object definitely surreal these are examples of surrealism this example right here what s in here jordan train there s a train coming out of a fireplace okay again an out of place object these are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes scenes that do not make sense they re beyond real what s going on in this scene kurt there s like giant butterflies yeah the butterflies grew they re huge now they re like the props on the windmills what s going on in this can anyone tell what makes that surreal john like huge makeup yeah the si again the size of such little things grew tremendously and they re filling up the room also the interior of the room is now looking like the sky so what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really really big the last characteristic that we see in surrealism is there it is normal objects acting abnormally so in these examples i ll go through real quickly do you see these clocks they re not acting normally these clocks are melting they re dripping they re stretching they re falling down you can see that in this one the artist drew a person looking into the mirror but does he see his reflection no no the mirror s not operating normally it s surreal it s beyond real what it s doing is it s showing the back of his head and again in this one it s kind of hard to tell but there are three swans and the reflection is of three elephants so the reflection in the water is not acting normally these are three characteristics of surrealism all right so why surrealism why this style of art does anyone have any guesses of why anyone or why these artists created something like this yeah because it s like a modern form of art okay yeah that s actually a very good definition cara maybe to make it look interesting okay good to make it look funny okay good guys those are all excellent excellent answers here is another thing that went into surrealism like lots of art it s influenced by what s going on around it or what happened before it so these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism and the first style of art is known as dada art this type of art is where the artist took things and they tried to make something that wasn t considered art they took random objects like a bicycle wheel and the stool and put it together and said okay this is not art and that was an example of the style they also took a famous painting like the mona lisa scribbled mustache and a beard there it is that s not art and that was really the whole idea of dada it was like anti art another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something and in this example it s the idea of death there s this dark angel depicted over this man who s already halfway down in the ground all this white snow that symbolizes life around him and it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols and that s what that one depicts the other example or another influence of surrealism is metaphysical painting this one s very very hard to understand and that s what the idea was with the style it was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation basically one in which you do not know what you re looking at you don t know what the objects are you might know something but you don t know why it s there or what part of it it is and it s very very illogical and doesn t make sense these three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism so when you look at these three styles of art you can kind of see what they led to they led to this style of art which is known as surrealism so now where to start here s what s going on today today you are going to start with and you can open your folders up and you ll see this slide what we re going to do is we re going to start drawing today we are going to start by making a connection all right and if you look at this example up here on the board or and you can look at your slides too what we re going to do you can just take your stuff off leann leave it back there and then join your table okay what we re going to do is i want you to come up with something that means something to you and that s like your theme to start with maybe it s a hobby an activity a memory anything that s meaningful to you that s your starting point then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise so these are our options that i just discussed those are the characteristics do you want to move it around change the location of it do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn t be doing let me give you an example lily what s your favorite food strawberries strawberries what s your favorite holiday joe christmas jacob what s your favorite animal a dog okay so this is my surrealist example to you you have a christmas tree but instead of a christmas tree you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it so that s kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example these are some examples that i have that i did these are some of my drawings this first one and sometimes you don t even know where these drawings are coming from i wanted to take an object and stretch it i wanted to make it act abnormally so i chose a spoon and what i did was i thought well a spoon needs to catch something so this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops why because it s really dry wherever it is you can see all the cracks so that was kind of like my first idea the second sketch that i did was i wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting an unreal scene in an unreal place so what i thought was well pineapples are tropical why not cut open a pineapple and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees okay you re probably wondering what we re going to do with these today is sketching but what s going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting this is an example of what the painting might look like when it s all done i chose the pineapple one all right so we are going to be doing a watercolor painting but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting s going to look like up here on the board i think this is going to help you a lot this is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings and there s a variety of different things that the artist has done they might be food they might be animals they might be instruments they might be people they might be landscapes there s lots of things to look at i want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings i m going to give you paper right now use this sheet start with making a connection all right start with making a connection and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal all right how do you draw hands hands that s okay hands you know what this is just a sketch so this is a detail that doesn t or this is a part that you don t really need to worry about so tell me what s going on what makes this surreal um that s what i want to know because it s the birthday party in the present okay so which of these options do you think you re focusing the most on this one okay and why because a present usually doesn t open okay so the present so the party is within the present so the present gets opened up and then there s a party okay what else can we do to make it like maybe a little bit more like bam something going on that s the only thing i was thinking about you know like maybe like balloons and yeah balloons like they re com they re flowing out that d be really cool all right that s good what should i like do for like for like the face the face on a baseball baseball and what are we using for the parts of the face so this is a baseball bat okay and i okay these are the baseball bases oh the bases okay yeah and this is and this is okay so you re combining you re combining a lot a lot of different things so why freckles because like i thought putting more into it would make it more interesting okay you know what i think would make this really more interesting is the background what s going on around the face um think about it think about it what could we do where could this be in the sky i don t know so what would represent the sky what could you draw to represent the sky clouds try that maybe draw some clouds i think i think that s going to make your picture more interesting something like that because like someone hit a home run yeah okay and maybe some action lines around the ball you know like a little yeah that looks really good i like that i like that one a lot a dog eating pizza okay brittney yeah i don t know how to draw horses a horse yeah why do you need a horse because i want to draw like a horse what were you going to do like a horse a horse with a farm inside of it inside of it so what do you mean inside of it though like in here do like a farm and cows and well here s a suggestion because i like your idea a lot why don t we we can use this as a resource why don t we draw i ll help you with this just the back of the horse okay so we ll just work we ll focus on like the neck and the back and then the tail kind of coming down like this okay so you see where i m going with this now what i m thinking is why don t you draw your farm scene on the back like almost that it s like kind of been placed on there like a little miniature scene like so maybe on here you could draw the silo the barn and everything on there good eyes on me one two three okay guys you re doing a really really good job with your sketching and everything and i don t i want you to keep going but we do need to stop for a minute and based on the drawings that i m seeing i see some really good examples of surrealism and you re showing me that you understand it i bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art you could pick out the one that represents surrealism take a look up here on the board i have three tabasco sauce posters okay one two three and four show me with your fingers holding them up in the air which one of these is an example of surrealism think about it for a minute while you think about it i m going to wiggle my mouse so i can okay what s an example of which one is a jess okay everyone had four that s good why why that one why d you pick that one because like nope hold on i was going to let jessie answer first what makes that one surreal think about it michael go ahead the sides are like coming off the bottle okay and the pepper s like putting out the sauce okay good anything else erin it s like out on this like island yeah definitely definitely like a lot of things make this one surreal what does surreal mean again who remembers me it means like not like like not real but like in a different form right beyond real beyond real okay and this is a great example of that beyond reality okay here s what i need you to do now okay i have one more oh i might have to re i have one more slide that i want to show you up on the board and if you open up your folders you ll see this you ll see this slide and i printed it out for you what i m going to have you do right now in the next couple minutes i m going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table you might have to switch three ways or four ways or one way and i want you to assess the drawing that you get now if you get one that has lots of drawings just pick one of them okay here s what i want you to do on the sheet this is easy first thing what s the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received write it down maybe you noticed a big basketball maybe you notice whatever it is write it down then i want you to check these little circles whichever of these options that you see that that person used i want you to check them out okay michael and then i want you to write this is the one that everyone stumbles with they re like what does this mean all i m saying is what do you think that person meant in that drawing what do you think the meaning is if you don t know put a question mark all right and then what suggestions do you have for that person maybe they you know if you did a background it would look really nice or maybe you know what maybe you ve got to lose something you ve got way too much going on i can t tell what it is so this is not going to take you very long but it s important because it shows that shows me that you understand what you re looking at and it also helps the person get a better drawing which is going to be used for the painting so i want you to switch drawings right now everyone switch and i want you to use the sheet and i want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you re looking at okay so you re going to do this independently and i ll come around and i ll check with you in a little bit that s the first thing that you see write down the first thing that you see all right so lily what s the first thing that you see in your in this picture okay what do you think it is okay what do you think this is as a whole don t say anything because i know it s yours but this is good because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to so what s the first thing that you know that you th what do you see just maybe you recognize it just as water anything else maybe a blanket okay write that down okay that s a good start what s the first thing that you saw almost everything is crooked that s a good ob that s a really good observation because everything is crooked good so what options do you think were used in this now which one did you select normal object acting abnormally that s right it s clearly these objects are acting abnormally that s good that was a good that was another good observation so you just keep moving through did you write down your first reaction mm hmm okay and okay so normal objects acting abnormally,0.0
okay but before you check over what you need to make sure you do all of it get it completed right okay awesome so your goal would be to get homework completed wonderful okay excellent okay now i brought some extra markers and stuff here because i know you re a visual learner that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your learning styles test so this is for you to do you can choose any colors to make it look however you want okay so you ve got your goal and then we need to figure out why is that goal important so your goal is to get all homework done excellent and why is that important because when you re in fourth grade you don t get all your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence i ve been there a couple of times and is not very fun and for the good achievement you get to go to hot wheels hmm so if you don t do your homework you re on a boring fence okay you have to stand by the fence at recess and if you do do your homework you go to hotshots homework hotshots and that is what do you have to do to qualify for homework hotshots do all your homework for all the oh wow so all your homework throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go get to be a homework hotshot which means you go to hot wheels and enjoy the day skating excellent okay so you just brought up a good point umm so this goal is important because not only do you not want to stand by the fence and you want to be a homework hero what s going to happen if you do your homework you go to hot wheels you go to hot wheels and what do you think what effect is that going to have on your report card here if you re doing all your homework what s going to happen to those grades you get all the grades go up like the 100 200 that s right very good all right so go ahead write that down why you think homework is important excellent so this goal is important because you can always get good grades and homework is a way that teachers help the students reinforce the things that they are learning in class so that s an excellent way to get good grades okay so we know our goal and we know why it s important so let s think about what kind of rewards we re going to get for reaching that goal you get achievement awards you go in a limo with the principal and you go out to eat and hot wheels too right so those are some long term goals over the next nine weeks you get to complete your homework the next nine weeks you get to go to hot wheels and might even be on the principal s honor roll to take the limo ride pretty cool huh okay so that s here we ve got don t forget one thing that you get to drink soda while you re going you do i didn t know that i ve never been in there i ve never been in the limo but i heard oh my goodness well that certainly is a nice incentive something to motivate huh good so that s kind of a long term motivation we ve got to work hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that right okay so we ve got here when i meet my goal for the quarter quarter is another way of saying the nine week time period you will what what do you get to do if you do all your homework over the nine weeks i will go in a limo well that s for principal s honor roll which is definitely an option what s specific for homework umm when i meet my goal for the quarter i will go to hot wheels go to hot wheels awesome excellent so the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away can t it okay because nine weeks is not easy they are not easy to do your homework because it s a long time before you go to hot wheels and we only have eighteen weeks in school so it s easier sometimes to stay motivated and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on more of a short term basis meaning that instead of waiting all nine weeks to go to hot wheels which you will get to do if you meet your goal let s think of something that we can do maybe once a week that would be a good incentive for you study okay well studying is part of your homework plan let s say that you study and you turn all your you do all your homework and at the end of the week when i check in with you when i check in with miss butler and i check in with your granny and i d say so how did annamarie do did she get all her homework done mm hmm and they say yes she did what do you think might be something that you re willing to work towards here at school that would be a reward once a week i will come to you and i will help you you d like to help me all right so could we agree that let s say i check in on fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out did she do her homework what are they going to tell me yes yes and then on fridays you get to come and help me mm hmm that d be wonderful now i teach a first grade class every day at 12 10 i know you do a really good job helping out at home with your niece but she i do not get to see her monday tuesday wednesday thursday but on friday i do because my mom my mom watches her and sometimes when my sister and i and the baby s not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and we talk to her on phone awesome she s lucky to have an aunty like you awesome well i know because you do such a good job caring for her that you d be an excellent helper for me and my first graders will that be a good goal for you okay so our next section here can you read this when i meet my goal for the week i will get to go to go to hot wheels i think well hot wheels is for the whole nine weeks but each week remember our what we re working towards on friday that you get to come help you right so you get to come help miss charles on fridays okay you have very nice handwriting thank you okay so do you thanks okay so this goal is something that you re in charge of right you re in control of achieving this goal but you re not in it alone because there s of a lot of people who want to see you reach that goal and to see you doing an awesome job at school so who are some of the people the adults in your life who are on your team who can be helpers for you as you reach this goal my grandma my aunty my uncle my mom and my sister wonderful you have a lot of people so these are people at home that can help you reach your goal all right so let s go ahead and put those down for supporters at home awesome all right so you ve got a lot of people supporting you at home i ve got five and how about here at school who s on your team miss butler and miss charles you ve got it girl i can t wait to support you on this goal okay so the people who can help me at school is miss charles is it okay if i put in miss ficker my assistance teacher because she helps too definitely that s a great person to add and so are you thank you okay i just realized something what s that all these teachers name has a r in it miss charles miss butler miss ficker it s a good attention to detail you have there okay so we know that our goal is to get all my homework completed okay and it s important because you can always get good grades excellent now on the short term if you re doing a great job getting your homework done every week each week you will get to come help come help miss charles on friday excellent and i will know that you re doing a great job because you can ask miss butler my grandma and me that s right okay and over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what s your reward i get to go to hot wheels awesome and then although you re the one in charge of this goal there s a lot of people on your team who are those people on your team from home my mama my granny my sister my uncle tj and my aunty people on you re side all right and then when you re here at school who s on your team miss charles miss butler miss ficker awesome all right so what do you think how s the school going to go it s going to be great because i will follow all of these good and i m here to help okay all right well i think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we manage our time really well and i know we talked a little bit before about kind of your month we looked at the month of february and figured out what big things you have coming up what portions of the day you spend here at school or at church and what you do how you help out taking care of your niece so that s the month of february so what we re going to do today is really focus on this week and make a plan so what i ve done here is based on the information you told me before we ve got this week starting with today monday february 7th and you will notice i ve the time of day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till yeah 10 at night so i have these spaces blocked off so what are you usually doing monday wednesday friday from 7 to 4 come to school you re at school right so this whole area is school is school that s right you re here at school will you write school sure sometimes it s easy for me if i just draw a line to show that like that okay school okay so knowing that you re in school from 7 to about 4 o clock and we also need to think about some other regular things that you do during the week so you told me before that,0.0
okay so they re equal because of right angles theorem you are skipping a step again trevor tell him the definition of an altitude you tell me i have an altitude you have to tell me then what s the consequence of an altitude read the definition of an altitude say it the definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle i don t know how to word that right but somebody help him out he s making sense but somebody yes alright it goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly if that s a word don t say through because an altitude is bounded it starts at a vertex and it goes okay so now isaac what should be the consequent step two there right here yes whatever they gave you in those definitions trevor s and the improved definition by trey nobody said anything about congruent angles what did we talk that they re both right angles that they re right angles no we didn t that bd is perpendicular to ac ah ha that s what i got nice that s what it is so just write on top of that honey right here yeah the step two you should have that right you have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that s what reason says it comes from a defintion and why is that because of tell him why is that definition of altitude definition of altitude okay you see how when we were working with the picture we put those boxes on the triangle what did those boxes say indicate that they re right angles they re right angles okay so that should be and why do we have right angles somebody tell me why do we have right angles definition of perpendicular lines yes that s a consequence if you have perpendicular lines so i m going to write adb and cdb are right angles yes yeah okay you guys the rest of you might have started with the fact that it s an angle bisector right yeah yeah and that s okay if you started with that it s okay doesn t matter you could have started with the bd is congruent to bd you don t have to start with a given but that s traditionally the way we do it i can t believe i got this it s because of it s the definition of perpendicular lines what s this okay wait breathe in and out now let s go see what s going on okay step to the side adb and cdb okay still you need to have an angle a side and an angle do you have a congruent angle after all that work i m going to do that now okay what are you going to put angle adb is congruent to angle cdb because the definition of right angles nope right angle congruency right angle congruency theory well i haven t what is the definition of right angle that all right angles are congruent what s the definition of a right angle 90 degrees it measures 90 degrees yeah yeah all right angles are congruent is the right angle theorem that he s writing okay let s see what we have if you would number them that would help that s one and what s the consequence for after one i m trying i am old and somewhat blind from here but i know is that a 2 right under that at the perpendicular line you have 2 what is that ad is perpendic no after that angle adb is congruent to angle cdb wait he wrote it it s all jumbled up and it s all there so but wait a minute let s make sense out of this because it has to flow okay you know when you have your perpendicular line what should be at the perpendicular line the direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines is what that the angles are somebody somebody that they re right angles i want to say that but then i just don t want to say something that s wrong no you re fine you were not here yesterday and it seems you re doing great hey so take the blue marker so that everybody can see take the blue marker because i would like to re number it so they can see it okay so re number them again one is the given the altitude so you want me to write over yes and then that s two now what should be three don t put three on that one what should be three somebody tell him what should be three the angles the right angles yes okay now honey after you have right angles what are you going to say that uh definition of right angle theorem no okay so right angles what happens after right angles because remember angles are angles i need to talk about angle congruency but you haven t said that you talked about right angles so now what are you going to say you have it there honey angle adb is congruent to angle cde okay so that should be the next step that s four okay you remember good great remember when i asked you at the beginning when we first started doing proofs to keep track so you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle yeah right here not yet we haven t touched that guy yet we don t even have a number for that guy he s just floating in there what angle is congruent to what angle have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle yeah adb is you just did right okay go cross out one of the as i don t think you specifically did this but i ve noticed that some of you i ve noticed in abby and i would notice in a couple of you taylor that you were always after you prove something you found it within your proof you would kind of cross it out in here okay i found this or some of you would come over here and actually write it here it s like you re taking attendance i need angle for an angle i already have an angle keeping going see what i m doing here i showed you this way back yeah he s probably getting confused because of number three how he put adb because it should be abd and dbc instead of adb wait what what what number three the original number three yeah the b should be in the middle instead of d it should be abd and dbc that s right that s why that s why yeah i didn t noticed that yeah i thought he put that you guys are smart yeah that s how you got confused with everything else okay so now segment be is congruent to segment be because of reflexive property so that s another side and then it s given that bd is an angle bisector so that means angle abd is congruent to angle cbd okay but the issue here is he hasn t listed that as a given right just like people say well you re making that up how do you know that and you just say it s given but you didn t write it yeah he did yeah yeah he did it s right there it s number four he just did it wrong it s backwards it s all there so that should be step wait a minute one two three four five four should be one whoa three should be two one should be so there s a one two three four and then five wait five right here six right above it six seven okay can you change the numbers fix the numbers yeah please fix the numbers it s there okay we got it we have an angle bisector the consequence of an angle bisector we have an altitude the consequence of an altitude we have reflexive property so do you have them all yeah so what could you say now the triangle i m going back to the black marker okay let s get him out of the hot seat okay micah yes micah you tell us is he finished with the proof no why because you said no who said no you but okay you re supposed to tell me if there s something well you have to put that it is the i don t know frank to the rescue he hasn t proved that it s isosceles yet and how do you prove that it s isosceles i don t really know that sounded so tough frank yes okay you say segment ab and segment bc are congruent by c wait how do you say it cpctc corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent i always mess it up i can t do the cpc i can t do that i say the whole thing okay now frank is he finished i think is he no not yet no he s not okay why tell him why since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because ab is congruent to bc so what should be his number 10 triangle abc is isosceles and that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle yes i m so proud it keeps getting better i told you it would get better teamwork i was stressing last night because i was like it s so hard okay you guys understand what this means but i m trying to hurry it good job isaac yeah isaac a good job very good isaac one big clap for isaac one two three alright yeah you did good okay so you know what this is the proof that the new program where i give you because i want to make sure you get it enough information to do this on our own okay and then i m not going to write it out we re going to talk about how to do it and then you re going to complete it tonight at home so what do we need to do what is given there jonathan what s given the middle one this one honey cb is an angle bisector of acb cd is an angle bisector of acb okay what does that give you once you have an angle bisector no that s not it don t look at that one that s a totally different proof this is one that i m going to give you tonight so what does cd being an angle bisector of angle acb mean,0.0
what note are we going to start the question with for bell marilyn doe it s going to end that note is f thank you what are we going to end the question with what are we going to end the question with josh anything but doe anything but doe what are we going to start the answer with start the answer with paige yeah you can actually start with doe okay so this is really anything okay and then anything else for anything in between got it what part we have 15 r s and we have a five note scale abby the c s and the e big it there we go eggs and bacon are coming off two eggs whoops one bacon here we go john before you go to your instrument boys and girls yeah well my shoe fell off can i have these two rows speak the question and these two rows speak the answer just so we solidify the rhythm ready speak in pack speak in pack ready set speaking first valentines valentines pink red and blue now you i made a pretty one just for you switch please question answer ready begin valentines valentines pink red and blue i made a pretty one just for you okay two jobs when you get to your instrument remove eggs and bacon by drawing your fingernails down the nail and pulling towards you job number one always in this classroom is not to talk while i m talking thank you job number two make your x one take off bars two make your x ben j that s my instrument thank you i m going to move it now yeah there s okay i ve already set my instrument anybody not get a turn on the basses yet this year not had a turn on the basses yet everybody had a turn i haven t yeah you have okay let s have josh and britney go to the back row and start their jobs oh my gosh we do not have time go that row may go okay you re about two seconds too late on that your row may go now draw your finger to the top of the nail and pull it towards you sabrina egg oh they re wrong okay eggs and bacon agata s row may go and the last row may go how come on this it says h equals b cause in germany they don t have b they have h we have instruments made in germany josh is ready britney s ready ben is ready abby s ready all right boys and girls you have two does on your instrument two f s would you locate one yes you have two f s locate one and hover both mallets above one hold question on f speaking and playing alternating bounce c ready set and here we go stop we gotta do it again because josh remembered half way through that he was supposed to speak while he played let s try it again josh ready set and here we go excellent answer on the other f hold answer on the other f ready set and here we go yeah we re going to try the answer again just some of you might have messed up the rhythm ready set and here we answer make your x this time you re to do the question again but you may use two bars this time but we have to start beating the question on what mill f f so one of your bars must be f the other bar has to be next door to f in either direction here we go question only starting on f only using two bars ready set and here we go uh oh what are we not supposed to end the question over dawn f f this time you may use your whole instrument for the question you have to start on f but don t end on f ready set and get question here we go good didn t hear anybody end on f i did make your x for a second i heard some people s questions that maybe sounded like this i don t really remember what notes i played i was just kinda doing whatever i wanted to up and down up and down could i sing that no valentine valentine probably not but if my question sounded like this could i sing that probably did i use some patterns in that like a good musician i did valentines valentines pink red and blue okay try it you don t have to do the same thing i did but let s do some repeated notes let s use some patterns and let s not be all up and down our instrument ready set and here you go not bad let s try the answer boys and girls start at any note you want but end on n and let s make it memorable and singable something you can remember something you can sing i made a pretty one just for you ready set and here you go not bad not bad here s what i would like to have happened i m going to ask the question tyler s going to give the answer i m going to ask the question amanda s going give an answer i m gonna ask the question answer question answer question answer question answer and then the next row we re going to switch paige question me answer kia question me answer you get it okay yay shh paige would you mind before we begin arrowing over to the last slide i want to show you what i am looking for yeah go for it when you are doing yeah keep going when you are doing your question or when you are keep going sorry keep going that s it okay here s what i m looking for are you alternating your mallets are you bouncing your mallets are you doing the correct rhythm did your question start on doe if you re the question did your answer end on doe if you re the answer was your melody memorable and singable here we go my turn first so we ll go question answer down the batch feels and you get it todd i forget the i made this pretty one just for you paige question is ready here you go do i start this time yeah you start this time yeah you re going to do the question now i m giving you the answer now question answer question answer let s actually do this question answer question answer question answer ready britney josh you get ready to do the answer ready britney here she goes oh you know what ben it sounded like the end was ended on a doe oh yeah all right you want to try it again that s why eli was like oh yeah okay ready go good sabrina go it s um question okay nice job now some of you didn t get a chance to do the question or didn t get a chance to do the answer right so here s what i m going to have you do and we have 30 seconds to do this with the person next to you one of you do the question one of you do the answer okay let s try it together ready set and here we go answer nice here s the beauty of the pentatonic scale boys and girls no matter if we re doing a million different things at the same time if we re all on different bars the notes of the pentatonic scale sound so good together that you can could be playing something else and it still sounds musical,0.0
who s gonna do the skyscraper so we got to put size color and shape size color and shape ok i m gonna do a skyscraper beau is that for the past or the present that s for the present skyscraper present the present the present ok and the pyramid is for the past yeah and you ll do a pyramid for the past i was gonna do a log cabin that s what i was gonna do but we have to use different things because we don t got no logs well actually they still make log cabins now we can use brown for the logs jonathon says they still make log cabins now they do yeah they do we don t really make pyramids any more do we no yeah but they could be hidden in egypt yeah but there is four lines what we gonna do with the other two what i want you to do is list three details color size and shape so what shape will your skyscraper probably be a rectangle a rectangular prism a rectangular prism that s what dillon said rectangle rectangular prism okay then you can talk about your pyramids ask them they re your team a square pyramid triangle oh he said a square pyramid yeah let s do it a triangle you think it should be a triangular pyramid yeah i m with dillon well talk about it which one do you want to do i thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid you know because it has four sides it does have four a pyramid only has four sides well a triangle has four too it does one two three four that s a square honey because it has four well if it has three sides how many sides does it have three three so you have to decide so we could take a square and make it like a dillon agrees a square pyramid too i love having y all together let s do square pyramid and rectangular prism good deciding alright what are you guys discussing right now we re discussing what all we wanna do i like that okay we re not sure what play we re doing you re not sure what play you wanna do because everybody keeps picking everything so how are we gonna figure it out but i agree with randy so what do you guys agree on i agree with my plans he wants like an old time car and i don t agree with that but we don t understand how you do an old time car how do you do a play or skit about an old car that s what you need to tell them the only time okay aaron said something about the classroom and that i was going to be the teacher or something like that i wanna be assistant teacher randy likes that and this is two people from the past and two people from the present hear what jacob said jacob wants to be assistant teacher you re the teacher assistant teacher so when will that be in the past or the present present haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too and then we ll come to where they are then they ll have to show us what changed did y all hear aaron s idea you can say that to them i like aaron s idea listen to what aaron just said guys he has an idea that you may want to do ian and jacob and haley are from the present and me and randy are from the past and we come and they show us all the stuff that has changed i agree with aaron i agree with aaron i agree with aaron or we could do like you two are teachers and like me and aaron and ian are like students and then them two teach us oh that s an idea you could do but then how do we do the past well but you could do the past and then how could you do a skit about the past and a skit about the present yeah they would be the same except one is the past and one is the present to where like no one had desks and then in the present we have desks oh what do you think ian i wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future well are we doing the future or the present present well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present okay well decide it sounds like you got some really good ideas why can t we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present and you choose your own people who live in the present well ian if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea yeah you choose your own people but you do it in the present sounds like y all have to just keep on you may just have to make a decision ok you may just have to make a decision sounds like you are doing great guys how do you spell transfer trucks huh how do you spell transfer trucks transfer trucks let s sound it let s tap it what letters t trrr a n c e r or something trr like tree t r you got it shannon did you hear shannon let s tap it ta jarius trr aaa a what letter is that nnnn n ssss c k s ssss transssss s i got s f f how do you make er at the end of a word e r you got it there you go and you know trucks so what are y all doing with transfer trucks i don t know he s the one who wanted to write it why was this on noah s desk case has some names yeah ok but what but why did y all um you re describing what each persons job will be and i have that noah and ta jarius and madison are gonna do what the waves what kind of waves what are y all showing from the past and the present i wanna do waves in the present do waves change from the past to the present do you mean like ocean waves have those changed over time i m doing transfer trucks what s it suppose to be a i m doing transfer trucks how have those changed over time horses carried them with like umbrella s over them very cool and we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier and you said that was like a truck you could pull that up back up there i could pull it back up do you wanna see that again cash do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time shannon what are you doing what are your illustrations gonna be showing change over time she might do cars or something do you wanna do cars you don t have to do cars you don t want to lots of things have changed over time you can actually buy food and not hunt it how do you spell shannon that s one of the things you could draw the change from the maybe you ll do washing machines yeah yeah that works yeah cars change do you wanna do transfer trucks no you re already doing them guys do you wanna do washing machines madison draw a washing machine next to that you wanna do washing machines can you hold that up so they can see it because shannon can t see it where did ya wash your clothes at turn it over like this and you d rub them against here different isn t it yeah when i was little my great great great great great great great grandma grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when i was big i was allowed to see it very cool there was a picture alright it sounds like you ve got some work to do guys i love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time i think we need to think about waves though because waves are a natural thing people don t really build and change those do we no so we need to think about something that has changed over time and don t forget our books buildings buildings buildings have definitely changed over time alright guys keep it up you are doing great alright let s see what you guys are up to okay what s going on over here well we re thinking about about cassa coloring ann coloring and me coloring and drawing and her drawing i love drawing you love drawing that s what i love i love typing at home i love all of it very cool alright so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing we re gonna show the style the color okay can you tell me what you re gonna draw we re gonna draw dresses oh dresses and shoes like dresses and the shoes that they would wear i can get my old dress my mom s old dress she s got i have it and i can design it you can uh huh so are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present yes or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present we re gonna do it all together i love that them two are coloring i m coloring and me and her are drawing very nice you re drawing yes we re drawing i m coloring very very nice well it looks like you guys are ready for your next page let me ask you this how has clothing changed over time the color has definitely changed the colors have changed and the shoes ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses oh so they used to wear really long dresses and now they have short dresses that come up to here yeah and shoes they wear lace up boots laced up boots i think my mama has them i won t be able to wear them but i might be able to bring them oh that d be cool if you bring those it sounds like you have great ideas and they wore hats back then cause i m thinking about my mom s dress i mean i can design it i am very very pleased with how much you ve accomplished together in your group let me get you the next sheet okay we all have our things done and we re going to get it and we all have each others phone numbers here s the next sheet let s look for a second who will design the piece from the past and who will design the piece from the present now that doesn t mean it has to be separate right you can take it home well me and her well it sounded like we re all okay yeah we re all basically doing it okay why is this change important to people today and how could this continue to change in the future hmmmm there s some questions to think about so have you worked on this some more you ve decided to what you re gonna do skyscrapers and pyramids they re doing the pyramids me and him is doing the skyscrapers them two are doing the pyramids we re doing the skyscrapers that was nice good going coming up with that good job we re doing a square pyramid you re doing a square pyramid yeah that s easy all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top so when i was with you before you said this is hard we don t know what we re gonna do and all had different ideas and as it turns out this is kind of easy what made it easier working as a team working as a team dillon would you mind sitting over here sweetie so that everybody can hear and see what you re doing yeah kinda off by himself over there huh sweetheart alright the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is how has this changed over time buildings how have buildings changed over time pyramids pyramids been tooken down did we ever build buildings out of gold no i got something pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in eygpt like more land okay what about buildings in general how is this building different from mcwilliams it s bigger it s bigger and has more space which one is bigger mcwilliams and it s newer it s newer so how do you it s newer or it s smaller he says it s newer,0.0
like compared to osteoblasts the osteoclasts to be more efficient and work harder than the osteoclasts therefore you re more than you are building so that ratio can cause brittle bones so what okay right yeah one s up one goes down yeah if you re taking away more than you re putting back no i m sorry why don t osteo cause there s a lack of estrogen and or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work we kind of hit on that a little i don t know i kinda did but i kinda didn t what causes osteoblasts to work that it okay so when they re saying that the osteoclasts are working more what they re not saying more than they used to work they re saying more compared to the osteoblasts okay it s not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity they re just doing what they do it s just because the blast activity dropped which you guys got that the blast activity dropped why did that blast activity drop because there weren t enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting good is everybody get that cause see now the blast activity s what s really dropping and the clast activity keeps going like it normally goes but relative to one another you have more clast activity less blast activity and therefore you re losing bone everybody got that idea okay good you did a good job reasoning that out okay you can keep going matt okay our next question kind of gets off of like the description of osteoblasts and it says how can osteoblasts or how can osteoporosis be prevented brooke well they recommend having like a good number a good amount of calcium intake a day about 1 000 1 500 milligrams you could do that something simple like that could prevent like osteoporosis in the long run all right i would also suggest regular exercise in order to kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise so that there s less there s more bone actually broken down basically a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk along with everything else there s a i went to the food and drug administration you can have zoledronic acid which can be injected every two years for like prevention along with the diet and exercise anybody else have anything they d like to add i was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other nobody else okay now who s on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed yeah i found the most current one is a form called dual energy x ray reabsorption test to test the bone density you get a score of either one or below means you re normal one to 2 5 is osteoporosis 2 5 and above it s just your bones are gonna break any time all right anybody else there s just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density so there s like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative that s what they use cause it s like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not so you kinda need more ways to test good you can also take a sample of your and analyze it to see if there s any signs of erosion or anything that ll lead to osteoporosis okay what s that called anybody know what that s called what is it bioscan good before you even go to the doctor like it s really hard to diag like there s not really symptoms of it but some of the symptoms are like bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that and breaking bones with little or no trauma what do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma what kind of fracture traumatic traumatic would be if it was kind of trauma pathological good job yeah pathological fracture that would be a pathological fracture if there s a disease under there like osteoporosis which has made it weak enough to break good call so somebody mentioned the scanner zach right you talked about that the abbreviated what did what was the full name of that scan again dual energy x ray absorption okay has anyone ever heard of a dex scan dexa scanner that s where the d e x comes from dual energy x ray dexa scan and that s very common yeah is that like what the guy from pursuit of happiness yeah i don t know if you ever saw that movie i didn t yeah the bone density scanner i didn t know if that was it yeah okay so how did they what the general how they actually what bones do they look at in the scanner i think it was the wrist the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis the lumbar part of your spine because that s the first to go why what else is important to consider if you if you think about the type of bone being affected what type of bone being affected what type of bone i should remember trabeculae yeah so that s a spongy bone right so trabeculae of the spongy bone why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now it s a spongy bone yeah it s an irregular shaped bone but the body of the vertebrae is basically a cortex in and it s a spongy bone in there it s all trabeculae what was the other bones that you said madhura wrist and hip okay so hip as in what do you mean by that do you think robert ilium ilium it s all a spongy bone a spongy bone in the ilium good place to look for it but here s the thing what about the wrist how come think from a practical scenario how come the wrist yeah lexi i think it s cause you use it like so often that they is probably the most common because you use your wrist for like basically do you use it a lot another possible reason yeah kevin because it s a lot of like small bones so they may be easier to break or like be more fragile okay that s a possibility mikey i would say cause it s easy to get to like it s pretty hard to take like and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip it s kinda hard to get like a good angle but like your wrist can there s not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture okay thank you for that that s exactly why they use the wrist i mean the wrist bones when you think about em you know they re not weight bearing so they re probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones but they do have spongy bone in them they re little irregular shaped bones which have a cortex with some spongy bone so there is some material in there to evaluate but you don t have to disrobe you don t have to do anything you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what s called a screening a screening test has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before or thought of ever heard of screening tests being done for other things no not familiar with the screening tests i think i ve had one have you yeah because if i had like it wasn t for bones though it could be for anything like they were looking for appendicitis but they couldn t find it so they were doing other all these other kinds of tests i don t know if that well a screening test it could be it could be a screening test screening tests are basically more generalized testing not the most specific but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation okay so if you put your arm in the scanner and it was towards the low end it s not the best for making an end all you know quantitative diagnosis but it s a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium you see so that s why the arm so it s interesting that you brought that up that was really good cause it really helps us look at the whole where is this occurring and why do they use those specific bones okay matt anything else there our next question we have already said how it s diagnosed we know what it is so how can we treat osteoporosis well i said i found online that there were really no treatments like true treatments for osteoporosis it s more of trying to prevent it by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before because you can t really treat it once it s gone well that s funny i found something a little different there s a few medicines right now like talking about you ve seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it now they re actually saying like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you ve lost from the bones but it s also something kind of funny i saw if the bones start to become more dense they also found that like around your jaw starts to deteriorate faster some reason actually get like sore throat so i was wondering if anyone try to reason that out because i could not figure out why just your jaw starts losing calcium but your long bones start gaining it are you saying that they re taking medication and then they re experiencing pain so that yeah like the calcium to deteriorate but like your long bones it s like your limbs and everything start to become more dense is your jaw a lot of is it one of those bones yeah some but there isn t a whole lot in there there is some is it a more compact bone probably a more compact bone in your jaw there isn t a lot of cavity space or spongy bone space there maybe that has something to do with that even having a sore throat i don t know why that would affect it at all maybe because it s a horrible medicine i don t know like the thyroid gland like this one or the parathyroid this is like calcium like bone absorption so maybe i don t know it s not working as efficiently so it s not getting the through to the jawbone or maybe it s working too much or something maybe since your jaw is losing calcium and it s kinda gaining like losing its calcium so it s probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis your hyoid bone isn t your hyoid bone isn t it sort of high it doesn t really touch any other bones but it s kinda in there so it s kinda in your throat so that could be like i don t know it s kinda unusual just answer this one with the general area cause there s a lot of instances where you couldn t sit or lay down for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus so i don t know there were a lot of really bad side effects just well what i was wondering i kinda see like some doctors like just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention would be the other side to treatment just go do like those lifestyle changes instead of like thinking oh i ll wait until these signs come up and have platelet scans and i ll take medicine just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don t drink excessively and like have those good workout regimens so you prevent it rather than treat it yeah seems like a disease that s either prevented or managed not so much treated but i thought i think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids for like asthma like in your inhaler so it s something that inhibits bone breakdown so it doesn t sound like it treats it but it kind of manages it so you don t break bones yeah did anyone request a name a name brand fosamax did we see that yeah did they tell you how it worked no actually no well fosamax is like did you see something there zach yeah wasn t that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo osteo something bone reabsorption so they re inhibiting which cells osteoclasts okay yeah so that s how fosamax and those work they inhibit the osteoclasts so they re not building bone though you see the difference yeah they re not really building the bone they re stopping the erosion it s a little different but if you have like dead bone or old bone that needs to be replaced wouldn t that just inhibit it just as much because there s still old calcium sitting in your leg that i don t know whenever there s waste in your body that doesn t get dealt with i mean like when you have an appendectomy and there s waste in your appendix that like it can kill you if there s like waste in your body so maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis not so much as help it in the long run i m thinking cause any time you re keeping like something that s old in your body that s not good like you eat something you have to like you have to digest it and i don t know yeah it s a good thought process good thought process so that s what fosamax works that way so if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps let s say someone who has osteoporosis let s assume they have it now what types of mechanisms in other words what types of things will we try and get a drug to do what would we want it to do you want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better and someone already mentioned this but they had like estrogen supplements like supposedly like help out with that maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability okay well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement did anyone request that as a therapy yeah kevin and there s like these like it s like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches where you can take it as a pill so it adds estrogen to your body so it balances out your loss of estrogen and raises it yeah there s like he was talking about the hormone replacement but i also read on google health that it s rarely used and it s not used twice with women i don t know if that has anything to do with it i can google it i guess like if you use the treatment once any ideas why anybody find out why estrogen replacement they used to you know what they used to give estrogen like they give vitamins it used to be prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen seriously and it wasn t all that long ago how come it isn t get because then your body stops producing its like natural estrogen so good idea maybe any other poss nick any idea you can think of i don t know you re not producing enough so because you re not we should get more well how come have anybody heard of anything that s related to estrogen therapy bad things facial hair growth well testosterone can increase facial hair growth someone else over here cancer cancer and that s the problem they saw incidences of particularly breast cancer went up substantially and so that s why artie they re saying that you know hormone replacement it s still being used it s rarely used yeah but not like it used to be not like it used to be so if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly or blasts to work properly then shouldn t you like have like some sort of treatment to like make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts we would have like sort of a difference in their relationship good idea but isn t that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone so shouldn t we find a way to like make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they re stimulated but they have to be stimulated so show me if you re looking for a way to stimulate them more than make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes no that would be more like a genetic thing cause your osteocytes your dna is like breaking down as you get older so it s like not it s like i don t know is it mutating when it gets older i don t know a lot about genetics but i know your dna kinda breaks down as you get older and so that makes your cells not as efficient so it might be more of a dna kinda thing where you have to engineer that dna wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you re like 78 as when you re 12 so it might be in like that area but i don t know a lot about that so yeah it s interesting where you can go with it all right you can take this because even artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat what were you saying about that i don t know maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland i don t know maybe it like produced too much i don t know the jaw bone and it reached the jawbone first and i thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to the rest of the body so which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines maybe that s why your jaw s if you release a lot of that hormone then it s building your jaw up and when you re building bone you get growing pains maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw maybe,0.0
okay now when we sang that music scale we were we were actually stepping up we were going from low to high and if you ll look over at this you can tell these were the notes that we were singing from low to high the first note was a line note let s speak it together line note space note line note space note line note space note line note space note good job those notes were stepping and if you ll notice here i ve got carpet squares and i have them with line note and space note line note space note line note space note line note space note good job that s what we sang when we sang our scale and that s the notes that you re seeing up there are those line notes and those space notes all right i d like for us will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it sit behind the carpet square of your choice and let s go ahead and sit up tall on our knees sit nice and tall on your knees and the next person come in and find a carpet square sit behind it behind that hand chimes and i don t think we ll need we ll need one more person the next person what about me five good job all right now everyone even if you re sitting in your chairs you need to practice with me because we re all going to be playing the hand chimes today do not touch your hand chime just yet let s all just practice start off with your hand up put your hand chime down a second we re going to just practice with our arm only and it s going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that s going to make a difference in the way that it sounds all right watching me hold and again hold hold asanti hold hold okay stop now people down here pick up your hand chime and let s see if we can get that technique going get ready one more time good now let s just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop good now when i point to each person by yourself you will play the music scale so do not play until i point to you looking at me we begin start with the low c good job let s do it again that s the scale and these notes are stepping because it s line note space note line note space note any time you ve got two notes beside of each other that s a stepping melody one more time starting with the lowest c good job now put your hand chime down a second we just heard a stepping melody any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other two neighbors playing that s a stepping melody i want you to stand up please and i d like for you to stand up take your hand chime hold it and that melody someone raise your hand and tell me what did it do logan skipping actually it leaped you re exactly right it leaped because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play that s a leaping melody good job london do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping i mean leaping and skipping can somebody help us what s the difference between a leap and a skip if you leap it s more than a skip all right the leaping is more than the skipping skipping all right you sit down put the hand chime down and you stand up you keep remaining standing take your hand chime and you play that was a skip you are exactly right that s a skip when you just skip over one place one person all right have a seat you have a seat and i d like for ashley you stand up and what i want her to do is for four times i d like you to play your hand chime watching me i m going to let her try someone raise your hand what was that james what was that repeating you re exactly right that was a repeating note the one person that one pitch played four times all right sit down please now will you please stand you stand and you stand watching me all right raise your hand please tell me what was that devon stepping a stepping pattern and it went from high to low you re exactly right have a seat now last week i gave you a piece of paper and it was something that i wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping stepping and repeating on the music scale if you ll look over at the smartboard there is some notes there on number 1 some notes on number 1 and you were last week going to circle an s if it was a stepping pattern you were going to circle an r if it was a repeating pattern raise your hand if you know what those notes on number 1 were doing christian put your hand chime down and you can come up and circle whether those notes in the number 1 if they were stepping or if they were repeating you re exactly right christian how did you know that it was staying on the same note staying on the same note very good and thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes number 2 akrista can you walk around that other way and come right here and why don t you show us put the hand chime down please show us what the notes in number 2 are doing let s see if it s doing a space note and then a what line note line note and then a space note and she is exactly right those notes were stepping what down down and number 3 thank you ma am come this way right around here and she s looking at those music notes and she s going to be able to tell they re right here number 3 all right let s say it with her line note space note line note space note line note right here are they staying all the same no they staying all the same what are those notes doing they re stepping you re exactly right they re stepping up thank you ma am and tiptoe back to your seat very good job now i would like for the last two people b and c if you ll tiptoe to your seat i m going to call you back up here in a few minutes the rest of the folks you ve got to be sitting up nice and tall sit up tall on your knees let s see if they can play a very familiar tune i want you looking at the very first note the the very first note keiani you have that low c and what do you notice about c c keiani what s your note going to be doing what s the word when you have the same pitch re peating thank you he has a repeating note and g christian what are you going to be doing repeating repeating adam what are you going to be doing repeating repeating so we have a lot of repeating notes in this song sit up tall on your knees sit up tall pick your hand chime up we re going to see if we can play this familiar tune waiting one two ready sound very good that was twinkle twinkle little star it was twinkle twinkle little star you recognized it all right put your hand chime down a second i was listening you heard the melody all right now let me see sitting tall i m going to get someone that s sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit i think i would like for christopher will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody oh don t raise your hand we ll let christian choose three people that would be able to play christopher oh yeah christopher or you can call him chris that s christian all right tell me which three people just point to them all right he s pointing to you stand up with your hand chime we re talking about stepping now stepping all right okay chris has pointed to these three tapped them on the shoulder let s see if you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern will you just gives a thumbs up silently you re exactly right he did pick he did it he did pick three all right put your hand chime down and sit down i d like to call on harmony will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody leaping so you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder leaping leaping leaping okay now these two people are side by side there s a line note and a space note and they re neighbors someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play what would they be playing if they re neighbors that would be a stepping and i wanted a leap like a frog leaps over a whole lot so come and see if you can fix it real quick somebody needs to sit down who do you want to sit down all right sit down and pick somebody that will be a leaping melody like a frog leaping leaps over a whole lot all right he stands take your hand chime play now she leaped over a space note and a line note give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly yes that is a leaping melody good all right sit down hand chimes still on the floor i d like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair what we did in that song we had several times that there was repeating notes we had a few times where we had some stepping side by side and we had some leaping melodies when we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies the melody if you re playing a xylophone though you could do it right by yourself i can i would like keiani will you step around behind here and sheridan you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose and dev devuan devuan walk around here walk this way and he s going to be the teacher i want you to choose sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do choose something that you want them to play and let them see it turn it so that they can see it all right what do you want them to play step play a stepping melody all right good and stop now someone both of them did do a stepping melody but he was playing right here can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better a hit in the middle he says hit it in the middle hit where the music notes are those steps let s try it again play em soft great job that is stepping all right choose another one oh now he wants a leap good job what do you want devon devuan devuan repeat good job all right thank you put your mallet right there on the instrument lay it on the top that will be quicker for today and tiptoe back to your seat walking around the instruments i d like for wes h to step around and find yourself a xylophone step around over here akrista sit down tall on your knees and what do you want them to play tell them she wants you to play a repeating note now those were both kind of high repeating notes very high do you think you could play a low one good job now how did you know that was going to be low akrista cause the little ones are higher bigger ones are low you are exactly right what else do you want them to do she d like a what,1.0
who came up with the definition for radiation peter you had a good definition could you repeat that remind us i don t remember it exactly but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move waves that are radiated i mean didn t you say it was waves that are spread yeah waves that are spread by something and they usually have energy with them like the sun sends its radiation to the earth in the form of light heat uva uvb rays okay so with that understanding would you guys say that all radiation is harmful not all yes to a degree all of radiation is harmful but just it depends on how harmful but so then what is like when it s not harmful it s very very very not almost it s almost negligible what types of waves that radiate or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful radio waves any others jordan microwaves visible light yeah visible light isn t really that harmful what about microwaves that s a good one what do you guys think about microwaves i thought they were dangerous but somebody told me that they weren t they re not really that harmful are they i mean you probably shouldn t stand in front of it saying they re not that harmful they re not i mean i think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad but i think that could be the same with a lot of things the door shuts when you use the microwave too what about then where do they fall on the spectrum what makes you think they re not dangerous or that they are because they are longer than light waves they ve got longer wavelengths which what does that mean they have lower frequencies they don t carry as much energy with them lower frequencies let me consult my chart okay good idea or can anyone help her what was your question claire oh i didn t have a question oh okay what was the question why is she looking at her chart nope same we think they re not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light light is okay good so i think this is a good segue to the next question which is why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans while others aren t do you know what a segue is okay which ones have more energy than others gamma rays and x rays and uvh rays okay good peter did you have something you wanted to add to what he just said mm hmm okay good and can you repeat that sam some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy okay good so ultimately what is that energy doing why is that harmful to us can stimulate cell growth the more energy it has the more like materials it can penetrate like visible light wouldn t really cut through you but gamma rays could like travel through skin and x rays can what did you guys learn about perhaps in biology cancer well that it s when cells grow too fast the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and there s a mistake in the coding of the dna and then everything just goes haywire and the cells like what caleb said grow at abnormally fast rates and they just take over that area and spread well yeah they stop functioning as normal cells and their sole function is to reproduce and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells okay so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy this dangerous energy well wouldn t like cho said they would like stimulate the growth and or is that not why do they stimulate growth because they have energy what does the energy do to stimulate it what were you going to say ronnie well i just said that they trigger they don t like stimulate i mean cell growth to an extent is necessary but they can trigger something dangerous like with i don t really have like the percent or anything but what else might control cell growth dna okay good yeah lots of energy can can energy alter dna i feel like it can t well isn t that what it s doing if it s triggering abnormal cell growth i don t know is anyone in here have you taken or are you taking biology i took it last year i kind of remember what we talked about with cancer it s okay and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion that it does lie in the dna and that you know certain types of radiation can cause mutations in dna that affect the cell cycle so when we think about cancer a lot of times in light or electromagnetic waves a lot of times we think about skin cancer and we talked a bit about that yesterday we also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world so how does skin color variation how do you think it relates to the amount of uv radiation that a particular population receives you mean based on their race just based on their geologic background geographic background not geologic well i mean people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really really pale skin i don t think that s true i think it s just that it doesn t show up as much like you can definitely still get sun damage no of course you can still get sunburned but i don t think it s like it s harder i think so i think it s just less noticeable yeah i think it s just less noticeable i really don t think it has anything to do with okay so you re getting the same amount good you re getting the same amount of radiation sure is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb our skin absorbs it s actually it s in their grace and lana s video about how what did we do on your presentation about sunburn how sunburn works i don t remember okay so ultimately i guess i ll restate the question so how does skin color relate to the amount of uv radiation a certain population may receive we see a lot of variation so a lot of people often times say oh why do people in in countries that are near the equator why are they darker wouldn t that make them hotter because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light is that true is that what s happening it seems kind of wouldn t that make you sweat more then which would be good if it was hot i guess sweat sweat is just to release the heat on your body no but that s what i m saying like if you get hotter quicker then you would start sweating earlier which cools you down what is the pigment in skin that causes color variations melanin okay good alright so people who have darker skin do they have more or less they have more it s in eyes too right it s what causes eye color differences maybe i m making that up but what do you think the purpose of the melanin is is it to absorb grace offered one theory what s another theory too there there are several different reasons what does it do to uv light what s different about people that live say in the equator regions like the and people who live up north they don t get sunburned if they live there i mean there s like nothing to yeah exactly people who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned because they re not exposed to that much sun or their relatives weren t and as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin but i don t know why do you know miss roseborough yeah i have an understanding yes and when i think about it i kind of think about the actual pigment itself and what it s doing and where it s located on the body what it may be serving to do doesn t it synthesize vitamin d for us that would make sense yeah that s vitamin d from sunlight i guess that s why okay so people who have more melanin have live in the sun you know they have more exposure to the sun why do they need that extra melanin to protect them okay yeah so let s go with that to protect them from what from the radiation like i guess if you re out in the sun more you need more protection so like it s kind of like a built in sunblock what would it protect so it s on the surface right protects the inner skin it protects the outer layer right epidermis yeah i feel like ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking is that why they you have lighter on your hands oh i think that s the thing about like gamma rays for example being more like that was one of the question because they have more ability to penetrate through skin and okay so really what s happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin how does it do that it just doesn t the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat and so you get the heat but not the radiation right exactly so it doesn t go further into your body so darker people get less sunburned than fairer people because of that well does it necessarily have to do with sunburn and they re less likely to get skin cancer yeah i d say they re less likely to get skin cancer when you get tan are you getting more melanin in your skin yeah what s happening when you get tan so shouldn t tanning make your skin stronger well if it increases melanin i don t think it s necessarily increasing it because the tan goes away oh so it s like you have whatever your natural skin color is then that is determined how much okay okay so next misconception that a lot of people have or just something that i ve always wondered about i don t know if it s a misconception or not but i m thinking about colors that we associate with certain just everyday things so when i go into the bathroom when i go into the kitchen i see red and that indicates the faucet that i turn for hot water and blue for cold water why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true because fire is red water and ice is blue it s not really blue it s more clear white and blue flames are much hotter than red flames yeah explain that i don t know i guess back a long time ago before they knew that the hottest part of the fire is at the top and if you think about a flame usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom and then it s the red orange at the top which is where it would be the hottest it s hottest at the top but there s at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from at the peak it s the hottest but then the bunsen burner the hottest part is like yeah the hottest part of the flame is the top you get a marshmallow you put it at the bottom no sir what color is at the top guys red white or orange blue and white at the bottom it s an experiment miss rose let s do experiments on fire that s a good idea i think we should at this point do you have bunsen burners in here no i don t have a gas source so let s just go back i even broke it down and i was thinking about well where did this come from i was thinking what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red and what are being reflected by the color red and so is the color red actually hotter how could i relate that to temperature how do you even relate a color to temperature so just the color red what s it reflecting what s it absorbing what color does it reflect it reflects red and it absorbs green and blue or cyan right so going back to the what makes it that color its natural frequency what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature what s happening as a result of different white light say striking it and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light would red or blue actually be hotter as a pigment blue should be hotter because it has more energy it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency yeah sam s right so with a pigment think about a pigment first what about it just think about it yeah so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed and certain wavelengths of light are being reflected what does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light what happens to the energy that is being absorbed it transfers to the medium okay good i was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths so probably right okay good so it absorbs so let s think about blue again how could you apply that what wavelengths of light does it absorb shorter wavelengths than red well no blue absorbs red and green so this would be longer wavelengths and lower frequencies so red would absorb the blue therefore it would absorb the higher frequency had more energy which means it would be hotter right what do you guys think can you restate that sorry because red absorbs blue and blue has a higher frequency the red would be absorbing the higher frequency which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency so red would be the hottest the man has a point i agree with peter i agree with it too i agree with peter yeah that s sort of the conclusion i came to the only conclusion then i started thinking more i was like well how does this apply to stars so if i see a star that gives off a,0.0
okay so for our first trial we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding hcl and it took 73 5 milliliters and for our second trial we had the same amount of milk of magnesia but this time we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water and it took less hcl hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did and the first time we only added five drops of phenylthalene and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different and the ten drops definitely made it pinker but we don t think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator and not part of the reaction you guys actually brought up a good point how many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities how many think that you didn t add enough let s just ask that or how would you know if you added too much or not enough alright go ahead will well as long as it turns pink you know that the indicator s working what if it s pinker it wouldn t matter because it turns clear towards the end what do other people think alright vivian i feel like if there s not enough indicator that when you add more and more hcl to the solution it becomes the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink so i don t think there s such a thing as adding too much indicator our group added about five drops and that was enough okay what tad actually adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants so in an extreme case if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator that would definitely distort the concentration true what do people think about that alright jimmy the indicator doesn t participate in the overall reaction so it doesn t really make a difference what do people have to say to that alright why don t you take discuss would adding too much indicator would that affect your concentration like in terms of volume maybe you re adding to more volume of your reaction would that affect the concentrations of your reactants okay thoughts alright jerry i feel like if you added the indicator it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water if you added let s say would change the concentration okay alright stephanie i think it would like because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia even if you add a lot of phenylthalene it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that s what s reacting so i don t think it affects it alright mackenzie isn t ph determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions so if it s it would be moles over liters so if there were more liters it would be a smaller concentration right alright corey it s mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine they will neutralize it doesn t really matter the over liters as long as the moles are equal okay rick well since phenylthalene is an indicator it doesn t actually participate in the reaction just like water so adding it would just increase the volume which as he said which would dilute the solution adding a lot would have a profound affect but adding a little bit wouldn t actually make a difference okay richard it would because there s a lower concentration it would take a lot longer for it to react meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error because when you re using a burette it s continuously dripping so then if you re swirling and it doesn t react as fast then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it so those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with and all reasonable it does affect the concentration and when you add a few drops just like vivian said if you don t add enough then it s still indicating but in terms of the overall concentration the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small and so that s why you see like a very faint pink but it s still indicating now if you add more drops of course you re going to have a darker pink but the overall reaction volume would increase and so if you add drops of phenylthalene if you re adding like five drops compared to your overall reaction volume it wouldn t be that big of a difference so you would still have some source of error but since you re only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected you know it would make it so it s more diluted okay does that make sense to everyone alright those were all good comments anyone else have a comment alright so let s go to table two in last week s experiment we were testing how much hcl it would take to neutralize 25 ml of milk of magnesia first we measured 25 ml of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask then we slowly used the burette to drop the hcl into the flask and it took us 55 5 ml of hcl to clear the solution every time we d see that it s clear it took the solution longer time so the first time we stopped putting we stopped adding hcl but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink but then after the third or fourth stop that we made it took longer than one second so by the time it took so like towards the end it didn t turn pink anymore so for the second trial what we did instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia we just used 15 milliliters and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there s a change in the amount of hcl we used and it did because it took a lot less which was 35 5 milliliters of hcl as compared to the first trial where we used 55 5 so we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one it was roughly 35 5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m o m to come clear as over hcl and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn t expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once do you think you did something wrong well we kind of did but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear did anyone else did any other groups think that when the reaction was happening that you had done something wrong or were surprised by the results alright ian oh no just saying yes okay anyone have a comment we thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of hcl for the indicator to start working what do you mean start working to start turning opaque because it was pink for a long time we had to add extra hcl to the burette we actually thought that it wouldn t stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times stopped the burette from running and every time it kept changing color so we thought that happened throughout the experiment did you think it was going to go on forever yep okay any other groups alright andrew we noticed that yeah what they said it changed to clear and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink we thought it was the reversible reaction rates but then like we were surprised at how big a difference it was because it was really clear when we were stirring it but once we stopped became really pink okay alright will there was also a transitional phase where it turned light and we thought that was the phase it would turn into rather than clear so we actually stopped it there but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear so we started adding more okay alright group three first we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene it took about 7 milliliters of one molar hcl to actually fully huh yeah it took 70 milliliters and then it stayed clear from there for the second trial we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia would it would the time decrease i mean the time to neutralize decrease and so we add 15 ml of magnesia and the same amount of h2o and so we used up about so i heard something about timing because i heard the first couple groups timed some of the things what did you guys time and why did you choose to time that here let s start here because you guys timed something what did you time and why did you choose to time that well basically i think we re just measuring the amount of hcl we used up and see how many times we need to stop the burette for well we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more hcl we put the faster it was from the switch so we kept adding hcl and it turned all clear it turned all clear the faster the previous times were milky white and then towards the end it becomes clear like totally clear okay did anyone observe something different in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink okay table six as we added more hcl the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink okay so yeah rick i don t think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added rather than the time you left it in there so if you add more of course it s going to change quicker but it doesn t matter like how long you have to wait for so you guys were saying that when you added the hcl that it changed quicker to white and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink okay gabriel we timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore it will take a long time to get back to the reactions right back to the products which turns it to pink okay alright corey i was saying that it was faster turning back to pink the reaction was actually it was slower going back to pink that s okay okay let s go to table four in our experiment in our procedure actually we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide and one beaker we would heat instead of diluting it we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees celsius and we would perform the experiment with adding hcl using the burette and in the other beaker we would leave it in room temperature which is around 25 degrees celsius and we would do the same procedure adding the hcl with the burette our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction what we found was that when we heated it it actually changing from pink to clear it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature so we don t know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it ll react faster we also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did so that may have skewed our answers a little as well it took us a lot longer and more hcl to turn the solution clear again comments does anyone think that so this group didn t dilute how many groups diluted and added distilled water okay so all the other groups did do you think that their data would be affected because they didn t dilute and because you did what are your thoughts alright nina we diluted our second trial and it didn t affect the amount of hcl needed why do you think well from your observations that s obvious but does anyone know why or think why that might happen why would your data not be affected or think that maybe theirs was a fluke and your data should have been affected by diluting it with water alright joey is it because the hcl only reacts with the milk of magnesia so it doesn t affect how much water because it doesn t react with water okay what do you guys think alright katie i think it will affect it because the concentration s higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there s less surface area i would say okay less surface area okay that s a possibility alright gabriel i think it wouldn t affect the amount of hcl that would be added but it will just affect the time because with water it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there s more volume and without diluting it their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink and then at the end it will just turn clear either way why do you think it would be faster if they didn t dilute it because there would be less volume and the smaller the spaces the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around okay reasonable yep so our group kind of did both we had a control we redid the same experiment for number one and then we measured how many milliliters of hcl it took so if you change the concentration it does affect the amount of hcl it takes to neutralize it alright michael we diluted it and it took longer for us to we added more hcl for it to neutralize and i feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia there would be less molarity and if it s not diluted it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted it would become weaker you can t change the strength of an acid or a base because it s based on what it s by definition you can t make a strong base weak but that s okay wintel in our case we did two solutions different concentration the amount of hcl that s needed to neutralize the solution shouldn t be should be the same but in this case the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more hcl because during the delay the reaction the hcl hasn t still reacted with milk of magnesia yet and because of that delay there s more hcl that s needed to compensate for that okay so there s a little bit of stoichiometry going on where the number of moles or the amount the amount s still the same regardless of whether of milk of magnesia regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn t so the amount s still the same,0.0
tyler pushed the ball okay well how does that how does that affect the ball it makes it go faster and make it fall so why is that a problem because she ran because she because she pushed it i know but why is it a problem that she pushed it because it goes faster and that s a problem because because why she didn t win oh what do you mean win she win the game oh did you all make a game out of it uh uh we didn t turn a game into it okay well what are you doing then he s playing a game what are you doing kylie he s rolling and see not playing a game just rolling and seeing where they go wait a minute what rolling them to see what how many sticks it takes so did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one taking turns oh okay so do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them not push them so is that what you re saying it wouldn t be fair if she pushes hers but no one else pushes theirs because pushing makes it go faster you said okay alright so it makes it what makes it go farther okay alright so do you wanna do you want was anybody else pushing theirs rebekah okay do you want rebekah and kylie to do theirs over again alright show them how you and todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same now i guess i m gonna have to get our ball i need ball number two we need a captain miss henderson can i be the captain we don t need a captain you re all doing what you re being what we re not being captain s we re being what scientists scientists so work together wait don t pick up her ball she hasn t measured it yet five six seven eight nine 10 11 21 sticks where is 21 you looking for it on the hundreds chart are you looking for it on the calendar you can get up and point to it i got 18 sticks for my ball i can t find it anywhere 18 sticks i m going to see how many sticks i got for my ball okay how would you find 21 on the chart i don t know where could you start by one okay 20 oh you found it do you need more sticks honey 17 yes okay go ask another group can you borrow some sticks another ball 12 so it takes half of 14 because she said no i m using it and she and i said i have a idea and she said no what was your idea john i was just trying do it on my head like on my back of my head then down use your head as a ramp uh huh and where did you have the ball hun in her pocket the whole time why em does the ball belong to you or to the group group so if you re not using it should you let someone else in the group use it okay go ahead roll it on my back and now roll it if it does it right here no i mean like right here where do you want them to where do you want them to start the ball i think is what they re asking in my head somewhere like right here because a ramp starts where on the top up high and goes down so if you re using his head i would lay like this oh did that work yeah what do we do with it after we do our balls okay you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we re gonna clean up in just a second put your name at the top of your paper please we used it on this one you re supposed to do all four of the balls ball number one ball number two ball number three ball number four we would do ball number three number one is this one how about number one but this one which number is that one so get number three we ll have a race and we ll so what are you all doing with the ramp now we re putting it on the chair and whoever gets it whoever gets down to the bottom first we were actually gonna roll off it well why won t it roll off that ramp because why what stops it the block the block stops it okay so how much does it go try the little one whoever is in front of me move i got 10 miss henderson everybody is taking our balls okay guys i would like for you to clean up your things please i saw some great science learning science work put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug put your paper at your seat quickly let s see how quickly we can clean up id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you ve learned john you have to put everything back in your basket buddy all the sticks and balls please and then you may put your basket on the art table thank you to everybody who s moving quickly thank you to everybody who s moving quickly okay let s come to the rug and let s share some things that you learned today move that way please i said put your paper at your seat for now miss henderson braxton said this isn t whistling okay well we re not gonna debate whistling right now okay thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug okay i would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today tell us something you did something you figured out bryson if you push the ball it goes farther if you don t push the ball it goes not farther okay alright who else learned something else through their science work john that when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes and then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn t get to the stick then it gets farther and and we tried whoever gets to the stick it goes it s the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest okay the green okay todd what s something you learned today through your science work if you push it it ll go farther and that s it okay alright anything else we haven t mentioned eli there s a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it it will go past it if you make a ball if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop so the block stopped it sometimes yes sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it yeah but sometimes it stopped it okay grayson well sometimes what i did was i kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then i was rolling this big ball and once it hit it it kinda like jumped up in the air and went harleigh and moved in and for like three blocks for three sticks okay preston what did you learn today if you like if your hand go fast the ball goes fast if your hand goes slow the ball goes slow if your hand goes fast what do you mean by if your hand goes fast like if you re at the bottom and and you do that and go like that it goes fast what is that called that you re doing pushing the thing so if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow it goes slow the force interesting the force of pushing okay chloe i learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes when you lay what diagonal what is it called again what a diagonal line when you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster what is she talking about eli the what she s talking about a ramp oh the ramp when you lay the ramp diagonal uh huh the ball goes fast when you lay it straight it doesn t go fast it just sits there oh so if it s if it s less if it s a lower ramp it goes less if it s a higher diagonal ramp you re talking about then it goes farther interesting brody we tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that so you made you made ramps with your bodies so did it go,0.0
anybody tell me how much cases usually run at radio shack they re 30 dollars okay you know what so we ll factor that in in a minute but alex you had your hand raised so i d like to hear from you i was just gonna say that the 199 tax is gonna come in anyway so what if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping okay hold up cynthia but even though even though if you use 12 you re only gonna have a couple dollars left over with the economy these days things are not cheap so you can t buy something with five dollars you re not gonna get a case for that cheap that s probably right i m gonna hear two more of you and then i have something i wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about and i think is really important to point out so i wanna hear what you two have to say and then i m gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned go ahead it s better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to then you d still have zero dollars left but it s better to have equal or more money okay that s you know i think you re right that seems like it just makes sense right and one more yeah actually when i bought my phone i got a case just for about five dollars on ebay ebay so you got a used one and it paid for shipping so i didn t yes i did okay well you know what i wanna talk about that because that s actually what you guys just said is really important and several of you others mentioned it maybe we don t want maybe i don t want to have the exactly the price maybe i want to have at least and if i say i wanna have at least 200 dollars is there a way to say at least with math symbols to make that equation change so it says least cause right now it says equal is there a way to do it so it says at least colin if you you need to get the iphone and the case in the same shipping order or else it s gonna cost more for shipping oh okay so yeah i need at least a certain amount yeah so you re gonna wanna jump in on that guys you need to put the greater than or equal to sign but what does that look like the greater than sign with a line under it okay and what s the word in english that we have for that symbol yeah say it again alexis that least it is so now how much do i need to save to get at least 200 dollars right so it s okay if i have exactly or more than so that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about maybe i need more money if she wants more more than just a phone i m sure she does right with the what about the just come with the phone just that or does it come with something else like a charger battery or even a case itself so again you re saying i need at least 200 dollars right depending on what comes with the phone like a christmas special like half off or something what you can also think is where you gonna buy it and where is there s no tax and stuff so it depends on where you re gonna buy it if you want no tax that means like on ebay or something but it might be 50 percent off and stuff like that okay interesting i m just saying it depends where you re gonna buy your phone okay no i like that a lot when i was doing my equation i got 121 so you would still have a dollar left over and you know how cassidy said that she can get it on ebay that much most people they i understand that it s cheap and most people want it like that but i bought stuff off the line before and some of the stuff does work good and some of em you drop them and it breaks so it s not always good somethin to pay attention to all right i m gonna change the conversation a little bit because i think you guys are doing really really well let s go with what you guys said and say i need at least 200 dollars if that s true is there any way to find out or to answer the original question which nick brought up how much money do i need to save each day based on what we have so far where do i go from here there is a way to solve it you grab 200 dollars and then you subtract 80 from it okay i m gonna stop you right there i don t mean to interrupt katherine you re watching this and i saw your paper what do you think about what najeem just said like okay and why is that i don t know that s how you solve it in equality okay so can you repeat what you said you subtract 80 from both sides okay i m gonna go ahead and do that right now and what does that leave us with 120 and you know what i have a question what does that 120 represent i mean if 200 is how much the phone costs what s 120 about i m not sure how much you need to raise until then okay okay and nayanna can you comment on what you think might be the next step divide 12 from 120 again divide 12 from 120 okay and somebody else jump in the answer was the answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10 okay and katie you were ready to say something what would you say i was about to say equals 10 x equals 10 and x equals at least 10 oh it was so you re not liking what i wrote over here alexis at least cause you have to keep the all the way down okay katherine what do you think i agree with alexis because it can t just like change because when you say it can t change what do you mean the side oh okay that s good i didn t know what it was i m just asking and then you have to put what x means oh oh oh so what is the label what are the units we re talkin about ah the blue tooth if you wanna have a little extra money you could have more and plus if you get a little extra money one day but you have the same another and you get a little less the next day you could raise up for another day oh like if i m going to collect cans and i don t collect as many cans one day but i collect extra the next day yeah like that nayanna you had your hand raised when you have to add 40 to 200 for the bluetooth ah that s an interesting idea so maybe we so tell me what to write instead of this how would you change this to incorporate what you just said 80 plus x equals 240 okay are you pleased are you okay with that i disagree cynthia i disagree with your answer on that one i don t agree that it s 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money you would you should you should do 11 for a day because if you do you ll get 132 and then you ll have extra money okay but that s the problem what do you mean when you say it s not asking well it s not asking for extra money or anything it s just asking how many how much money you need per day anthony i noticed you ve got some stuff written down what do you think about i wanna go back to what nayanna said she says she s gonna change the equation here and she put 240 up there why why did she do that and do you agree with that yeah cause then you would have a little extra money left a little bit you would have a little bit of extra money left okay like the bluetooth in the case maybe okay isn t this another problem another problem not a part of this one yet yeah cause they re not asking how much extra money do you need this problem this question s not asking how much extra do you need for a bluetooth also okay how much are the phone and bluetooth it s just asking for the phone okay i think because the question wasn t asking to bring extra money into it we just brought the extra money to round the make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay but we shouldn t change the equation cause it s not asking you to okay this question isn t saying anything about case or a bluetooth yet it s a yes question and this question talks about bluetooth okay so what i kinda like is you guys were doin this problem and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem which is no problem at all let s jump ahead just for a minute and assume that i did want to get the bluetooth would this be the equation to represent and before i answer this question what i would like to do i m gonna call on olivia and then i m gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co pilots and the pilots come up but not yet let s hear what olivia has to say would it be equals 12 x if you wanted to get it before christmas or would it be after one more time i could barely hear ya would we still get that before christmas or would it be after before before so would it be 12 comments on that i agree with that thumbs up if you think 12 thumbs down if you think no we don t need 12 on this one okay adrian you have something we need to know how much money you earned each day well that s what do you guys think about that question well that s what we re finding out right now i know but how much you earn that s how much he has to save pilots switch with somebody in the back all right here we go so now i have a question for you can everybody turn around for just a minute please thank you question for you if i wanted to graph our first solution on a number line what might that graph look like so will you guys agree that okay we need to earn a minimum amount and at least 10 dollars a day but if i wanted to graph that put that on a number line represent that graphically what would that look like it would be like a it would be but the circle what kind of circle i didn t hear you shaded so you want to put this up here yeah amarra i d like to hear your opinion on that i don t i never understood the shaded thing i don t know why it s shaded it s shaded because it s not i think if it s not shaded it means greater than i mean greater or less than but when it s shaded i think it means equal to or less than or with okay tara do you wanna contribute to that well whenever it says greater than or equal to the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to or greater than which is over 10 but greater than or less than can t be that number so it has to be open circle and than greater than or equal to anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle unshaded circle in real life what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle go ahead al fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils a little louder i got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils so in that problem could 14 students have mechanical pencils if you have fewer than 14 no so that would be unshaded cause 14 doesn t count so in this question amarra the least number of money i should save per day is how much i think 10 is a good answer because it does go into the number and so would be shaded or unshaded shaded oh is that the only number amount of money i should save each day is that it are their other possibilities out yeah you could do,0.0
