emotions is emotions that s so right kippa were you going to say something else in this picture he uses lots of texture to create like when he s doing the sunflowers he uses texture to show the light going on right and how did he show that texture did he how did he apply his paint sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick vincent would that you could almost feel it feel the texture and emotion like ozea said emotion was huge for vincent if he was happy he painted bright if he was sad he painted sort of dark how about our man pablo picasso what movement logan is he do you know the move cubism cubism and why do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism anybody besides mr logan anybody else know but thanks logan for raising what are you thinking what using geometric shapes to make things using geometric shapes that s right he was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see and flattening the shapes and flattening his color where van gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self portrait i wanna put up the work let s start with our man vincent again let s take a look at see where my hand oooh you can see all the wrinkles in my hand no way isn t that cool okay sorry don t mean to keep fooling around so let s talk about this let s talk about these two paintings guys what do you guys and let s see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something what do you see do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here anybody somebody besides kippa carina that it kinda has to deal with his emotion like where the boats are i feel like what i m feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff and then at the sunflowers he s really happy and bright and that was good carina okay elijah did you wanna was that about what you were gonna say you were gonna talk about the sadness what colors like do you think that if go ahead elijah he could ve been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark light red and all these other bright colors right and i remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer that s why i looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions wasn t that what you were saying yeah he was feeling both happy and sad cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too right that s good okay jose what did you wanna say he s sort of like there too but the boats might be out to sea like one s out to sea but one s not but torn i don t know how many are already but three are out in i don t know how many are out there s four that are here and then there look like four that are out i think that s the other okay but what were you going to say oh you re right three well what were you gonna say about them i m guessing three two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad but they could only take three because there s only enough for there s enough room for only three boats or three people but they only wanted their own boat two or three of them were but three didn t go because they didn t know what to do or anything but the other three did interesting that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw kind of yeah i like that i like that trevor what re you gonna say it s kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers they re mostly up but looks like they re starting to droop they re starting to die that is good i like that he might be like oh i m happy for a while but i m starting to feel back down nice did you wanna say something i would like to say one has different types of one looks more real those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the than the bottom more realistic than this picture he really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers i think does anybody know what were you gonna say elijah you can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there s bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it s orange and then at the very bottom it s dark green like right there yes that is very true that is very good the storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting wow kyle happiness is never lasting and what was the last one i m moved by that opinion go ahead and what was the so in the flowers the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die because happiness can be fleeting and we know oh does anybody know what was the political was there any political things going on the political mood or the setting where was vincent from did you guys find that in your research he stayed in france is that where he studied is that what you guys are telling me yeah that was sorta the hub of his movement we ll say any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that s up you can look on your research papers to see or anything go ahead emily i think that the actual emotions of these paintings don t really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in france so really i don t think they were much of a really affected him what were you going along with emily maybe he was just so dull that or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending so it depends maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then because he didn t have the happiest of all lives so he didn t we ve even talked about that do you guys remember when we talked about how vincent van gogh suffered a little bit mentally he was a little crazy crazy and in and out of mental institutions yeah so maybe something good happened cause his life was not very happy so most of his pictures are no not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull but you can tell when he s going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in like the boats you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad and then if you look at the sunflowers they re all bright and dreamy i mean yes this is a few dark bits but i think that s probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life guys this is really great i love all your comments logan i m gonna take one more and then i m gonna tell you something what go ahead logan i thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something and then he started painting it sad i have a question i think that you ve got something really important hon yeah so he never really stopped a painting in the middle when he started he finished he never stopped because if the light changed it would totally change the picture that s so true that is very true and you guys know that jose is it okay if i speak real quick and then we ll go back because we wanna talk about picasso too for a minute you guys know that vincent used to live with a painter this is my fun fact not really fun i guess but a fact about vincent he lived with a painter paul gauguin this was when he was in and out of mental institutions and they had a fight and he became so upset you guys know he cut off his ear and i showed you that one picture of him is a self portrait of him with his ear cut off you guys remember that and the other important thing i wanted to tell you was that he didn t sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after after he died they sold one of his paintings for 8 000 000 000 remember that it was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time okay now let s talk about and van gogh people if you guys wanna talk about picasso you can but let s give the picasso teams some time here this is and i m sorry the lighting is not the best but who knows what the name of this painting is marie is it three musicians three musicians and it was done by who pablo pablo picasso does anybody know where pablo picasso was from let s see someone other than mr logan travis barcelona barcelona where s barcelona you guys spain spain i got my barcelona jersey alright and who knows rudy do you happen to know and he s like uh oh i m on the spot ooo do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in pablo picasso in cubism cubism that s correct and we did go over what were the characteristics of cubism real fast anybody mr logan geometric shapes geometric shapes and what else they were flat what was flat his pictures but what element his painting the colors the colors were flat thank you okay let s have some opinion about what you see up here the three musicians does anybody have randy do you have any how do you feel about it honey what do you think about it i don t know it doesn t seem like it s in a down mood cause music is usually a happy sort of thing so it seems like a happy kinda picture kind of a happy fun picture pablo he wasn t so concerned about emotions when he painted he maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time does anybody know what was happening in spain at the time what are you thinking civil war there was a civil war so maybe he was a little bit affected by that he also traveled does anybody know where he traveled to rudy to go and study the art forms of paris he went to paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff so he went to study there and then where else he went to africa he went to africa and he really became obsessed with african masks and so he did start using that as an influence in his painting carina what were you gonna say darling oh i was thinking it s kind of like a mix of emotions cause it has so many colors there s bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper there s a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention it s attention grabbing isn t it cause of all the contrasting i think more in his is the contrasting colors you can see the blue and orange right next to each other those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright they totally stand off each other right the blue and the orange i can t remember what oh they re complementary colors i couldn t remember what that was right so that s why and i think his color contrast says a lot his flat colors and they re bright and he puts them right next to each other what do you think about this picture robert do you like it yeah do you know why you might like it or you don t like it i like the picture like yeah well you and maria are talking about doing remember you were talking about making your own picture you wanna tell us about that what you guys wanna do for your own picture and you re doing the style of pablo aren t you yeah so what do you think you guys are gonna do have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the three musicians on a porch you wanna have the three musicians be in a picture with you and your brother and maria are you gonna not on a porch on a deck that s what i was gonna say and you guys are gonna are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes the picture yeah try to good good do you guys have anybody oh what were you gonna say elijah it makes me think about it because there s so many twists and turns and curves and things kinda like if you look hard enough you can see em but when you just look at it you re like whoa right when you first look at it you re like whoa what is that are those people are those shapes there s lots of curves and turns at first it s a little confusing at first it is a little confusing isn t it when you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for em you can actually see what it is right if we didn t tell you it was the three musicians you might not know at first you can kinda tell because of that one right there that thing yeah the instrument here and the guitar and then the paper with the two the sheet music the sheet music you could kinda tell it was about the musicians what were you gonna say when you first look at the painting your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue s clarinet whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying at first when you just but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form it does start to form what were you gonna say emily i think that in my,0.0
exactly right so what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically i know you re the big newspaper man and everything what do you think about that that s what i m talking about i m talking about the growth of the poem overall the first passage it s almost not objective but it kind of states what s happening it doesn t actually say what the author is thinking as the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it s more of the author s point of view and the author s stance on what s happening nora what do you think about the poem so far i thought it was a good like utilization of the message i m taking african american history this year okay we ve been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks so that first part we were talking about how they were like the sickness what are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything we have jettisoned the blind to no avail it spread the terrifying sickness spreads it s claws have scratched the sight from the captain s eyes the slaves were all tied together in their own so the sickness and disease could spread through them but also the slavers like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease that s where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they re in such close quarters that it s inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them superior as civilized but they re still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle so you really think that there s a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks who they think are savages i don t think it s even a point of transformation i believe that the author robert hayden is talking about this as it has been so this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they re sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it s like there s all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are er these whites are becoming like the blacks what s your favorite line that shows this nick standing to america bringing home black gold black ivory black seed now i especially liked the middle part of that black ivory because ivory is usually white of course yes yeah so you have the juxtaposition of black and white yes i think the lines after that deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones new england pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes jordan what do you think the about this religious connotation well seeing that i m not too familiar with the bible judaism and christianity are similar but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading i saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals these slaves and making the best of them in the new world between that and the evil that they re really bestowing upon the slaves standing to america bringing home black gold black ivory black seed is kind of glory and that contrast between evil deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones new england pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes they also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they re going through a time of spiritual crisis what port awaits us davy jones or home i ve heard of slavers drifting drifting play things of wind and storm and chance their crews gone blind the jungle hatred crawling up on deck it s like they understand that they re becoming uncivilized and they re trying to find a way to change this to justify their actions yeah that s what they need a justification for their actions so they say god is with them and everything is okay and you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn that jesus our savior pilot throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the god into all of this so that it s almost as if to me they re looking for their justification they re looking to justify the horrific actions that they re putting out which is ironic because these are often these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil so it s ironic that they re claiming that god is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks i think it s also ironic though that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world at the end talking about john quincy adams he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers the suffering that they had been enduring and that s like the moment of irony yeah the slavers are saying how paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august john quincy adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters and with his roman rhetoric weave a hero s garland for cinquez this is what i want you all to think about think about the historical connections here john quincy adams one of our founding fathers fourth president of the united states was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for cinquez and the other slaves that were on the amistad which is a ship that of course being discussed in here think about these historical connections i shall return all right group what s going on we re talking about a poem you re talking about a poem i m going to talk about a poem too what a coincidence i know isn t it coincidental what s going on what are you all discussing so far we re looking for the marrow part you re looking for the marrow part yeah i m glad you all have your beloveds out and everything what really interests me is the fact i think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated this is their story is it not what do you all think how can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of beloved in the second part in the last paragraph it says the fever is melting down my bones yes right now we re connecting that to stamp paid who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow as in his bone marrow we re looking for the page right now okay found it okay and it s on this whoa what is that read the passage to us my marrow is tired he thought i ve been tired all my days bone tired but now it s in the marrow it must be what baby suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life okay so let s connect what you say in this stanza you have i d be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones what is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion we thought that her fever is melting down we thought that it was it s pretty much the exact same connection because it s bones going into the marrow so the outside going into the inside the fever is melting down to my bones it s just taking a different way and to get more than a physiological point of view here the marrow is where where is the marrow in your bones it s like the core so raphael when we re suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way what does it mean for us it basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted okay so in essence then from a symbolic point of view just like in beloved we can relate this to the poem what kind of corruption do you see here for me it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy okay hypocrisy in what context mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right that they were different like this passage this short passage here it sickens me to think of what i saw of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men true christians all like so much jetsam yes and then at the very beginning they re talking about how they re throwing slaves overboard or even when the slaves decide to lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks sang as they went under yeah so there s this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning laura what do you think is going on in this particular context with all of the jumping off board it s a true escape to eternal freedom i guess if you believe in heaven the thing that confuses me is i understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over obviously death and more of a pain but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness the blindness and having to wait i think it s like another three weeks before they come to port so it s really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth this poem focuses i think on both sides on black and white yes it really does illustrate both which do you think is best illustrated laura the black side or the white side the black side is really i don t want to say common but it s similar to everything you hear about slave ships and the slave trade and the slave trade so i think it s interesting that hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don t really focus on what came of slavery even though it was a horrible thing on the last page here it says that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves i thought it was interesting because i often fail to make the connection that through the slavery we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the civil war jordan continue i was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about here it says their moaning is a prayer for death yes some try to starve themselves and then you go down one two three four stanzas later it says jesus savior pilot me over life s tempestuous sea we pray that thou will grant o lord safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls it s not so much praying for death it s praying and knowing that jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of who is praying for jesus here jordan the slaves really that s how i took it okay did anybody here take it a different way i took it as the sailors exactly good not that that s i think you re on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves so i think that they could be so i think there s a real sort of duality there for this point in history they evangelized evangelized they had already evangelized yes it s a hard word to say africa i know the dutch for example had already been there so historically speaking then raphael when you say it s the slavers that are the ones that are praying what s ironic about all of this that they re so much in the wrong and they don t see it all and that kind of hypocrisy and they re looking for justification for their actions speaking of justification what i want you to think about now for a few minutes i m going to talk to the other group up front here why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style it s all quotes it s all basically kind of like it s from a ship s log so think about this and i m going to be back to talk to you about it all right group what s going on it s all going on it s all going on okay tell me what have we discussed everything everything tell me more well we ve discussed about how in this stanza that there was hardly room tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon fashion there that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood that was talking about the capture of the africans yes who wouldn t be so thirsty that they wouldn t tear open their own skin and drink their own blood which is just crazy in terms of the suffering yeah and how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery and yet in the next stanza it talks about how the crew would lay with the the guinea rose yeah the crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins okay well let s talk about it for just a second we have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering what do you think yeah it s a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew like would sleep with these women exactly they re fully taking advantage of them imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey yeah it s a very big contrast because they are calling them animals so what happens after their lust in the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew they abandon the ship it goes up in flames exactly so it s basically set on fire and then what happens,0.0
what you just said they re going to go back together well i ve glued them down so they can t the green and the red charts are locked down in place they can t get back but i ve taken up the orange field wouldn t it generate a new field they re going to make a new field and that new field will be say it again oh like the earlier drawing we can actually say a little more than that in this vicinity here they ll be trying to pull each other back together so we re going to end up with a field that s exactly opposite what we did was they move around as long as it s still running they move apart until the field is basically nullified let s look at one more example do you have one more potato shape in there most people most people right so let s start for this last one let s look at this shape and say that i observe fields coming out like that write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction based on what you re seeing in there what can you say about what you see are those lines all supposed to be straight yeah to the best of my drawing ability they re horizontal parallel lines my drawing was perfect mr shields what they re going in two directions the orange yeah the orange one like a very large plate it could be just a potato in there and that s the thing in your hand this one yep okay let s take a look chris can i get you to shut the door to keep the noise down we ll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so it s nice to have the extra period here first thing before we talk about this new one i failed to address hannah s question and good insight earlier yes the orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they re going to bend and will be coming outward from the positive end so you re definitely going to see this sort of pattern i think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations anytime you ve got a conducting material anytime you ve got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with it s a conductor so it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field let s talk about this new one there s a couple of observations ian give me one observation and claire give me the second observation besides the fact that the lines are straight no that s a good one the lines are straight very important claire they re going in opposite directions exactly opposite directions okay hakim give me another one well the lines are coming out of it okay they re coming outward not inward good to indicate that the okay so that one we know from the very first piece here the net charge is positive the fact that they re horizontal they indicate like a plate or something yeah is it like two parallel plates two parallel plates so where would you draw them above and below there are two on top so like above and below like this four plates four plates let s make it 16 but if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just but what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle then it would push away on both sides two positive plates two plates sounds twice as good as one but i m not sure that it is four plates sounds even more appealing an infinite number of plates sounds fantastic i m hearing good ideas here i want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios so two positive plates okay two positive plates and i m looking at the vicinity in the middle here is that right and do i want my two positive plates to be on the sides negative plates well negative plates okay two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what bend okay we re getting a bending because if i draw it here but you still have to compare it d be like this kind of a picture it d still be bent greater than the distance okay so you ve got so based on that you ve got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape what about two infinitely long two infinitely long plates both negative what would the field look like forge the potato shape what would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long evenly charged negative plates wouldn t they go if i take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle what would it do what if i release it a little bit to the left side an infinitely long plate we derived this one before a single one remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane it s constant it s a constant exactly right brittany didn t even have to look at her notes on that one but you remember what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate yeah gravity on the earth here you know big flat earth i don t care how far above the ground i am it s the same number it doesn t change at all that s exactly right so an infinite plate the field is some number another identical infinite plate it nullifies it so in the same charge okay well that isn t going to work infinitely far infinitely far away from each other when brittney says it s a constant even if you go to infinity i guess it d still be a constant either that or you go to zero it would be two sets one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they re infinitely far away where two horizontal plates like this yeah because i don t think that s going to work either ben you re getting agitated back there and what are you saying we were just talking you re saying there s no way in the world they can be infinite is that what you re saying yeah you can t have an infinite plane anything because you re defining the shape so that s a good question when i ve got the shape here do we require that the thing that i m talking about fit inside of the shape no i m going to say no okay so does that change your answer okay i think we can and will look at situations where the surface and remember this is all leading up to that gaussian surface idea we mentioned on friday where the gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object like an infinite plane we need to be able to study those even though i can t fit it inside of a box so we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there an infinitely long positive plate right in the middle right in the middle is that what you said about seven minutes ago yeah i tried to ignore him because i didn t want you guys to get the answer too quick but i do want to acknowledge him yeah tell me if this makes sense and why somebody besides john and ian it doesn t make sense that i ve got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it s a positive plate would it have to be infinitely long much longer if i don t now i m not very good at drawing in 3d so is the potato lines are they diverging this way at all i can t tell they re uniform this way parallel lines this way so we know that it has to be infinite this way and not have divergence this way well i didn t draw any lines coming out of the do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging that s going to change the answer that you give if i draw another red line that s coming like this that s clearly diverging from this red line so i m going to assume that every line for this problem every line that i draw is parallel and then we ll get a new perpendicular with the plate yeah perpendicular to the board and then all positive coming out both sides very good alright i ve got one more drawing on there i want to hit and then we ll just say some fantastic summary words and then i ll give you guys a break the last one here instead of the three dimensional shape now all i ve got is a single sheet of paper and this sheet of paper i ve got i noticed i noticed parallel lines arrows coming straight out of that shape write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict based on what you observed here what and where if you want to what the source of the field lines is what can we learn from the electric field lines they re all coming out parallel in one direction yes parallel in one direction one direction they re parallel this way and they re parallel this way also so they re normal to the surface everywhere are they coming from the other side all i see is lines penetrating this way so i could actually draw them like this and that s fine do you know anything about the other side of the plate like is there anything there it s a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate oh okay yeah they re not diverging at all yeah uniform orthogonal all that good stuff into the paper so they re coming out of here they re going into here and coming out here oh okay to the differences that s a closed shape this is a two dimensional surface if i had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference right okay guys let s see what we ve got here i m going to ask paul first emily second and then we ll see if michael can go for the trifecta oh no no pressure you can be wrong it s alright paul what is based on your observations what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object on this sheet i think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through where they re just passing through yeah so then where do you think it s coming from what does that tell you about the source of the electric field i m not sure you have more to say no emily give it a try since it s positive on this side yup you can see that there might be a positive charge okay so if i had a positive charge on this side i would get electric field lines going like this that s correct okay or if you had a negative charge ah okay so you re answering two things which is pretty overachieving but i like it that you re saying that instead of a positive back here it could be a negative over here okay now there s something incomplete about what you re saying the positive here versus there could be a negative here that s a great insight that it could be one or the other but michael s going to help us out because you re a little incomplete on what you re telling us they have to be infinite infinite infinitely strong charge infinitely long whatever a plane a plane yeah a plane back here that s infinitely large distributive charge that s positive that s the only way to get a uniform field here can it work with what emily was saying about it could be a negative over here it could be an infinitely long thing here there s one more option does anybody it could be intro that this piece of paper here is neutral and you could just put a new positive charge but be careful any positive charge if i start off with the very first drawing and i look at what happens when i put a sheet here the field lines are like this they re diverging i m not having divergence here at all so it can t come from any old point source we are going to assume that this thing is neutral though okay that itself is not it s just capturing the story of what s going on hannah could there be both a positive and negative along the plate yeah you can have both you bet that seems like a little bit of overkill but as long as you re making your sheet infinite in size you might as well make two infinite s you have all your infinite that s right and two parallel plates two plates that are parallel to each other one positive one negative is a very common thing so common in fact that it s on my tie today oh yeah there it is see that hakim do you have a question okay so it s the positive plane that s standing or negative plane yeah the infinite plane the infinite plane i was about to say that that it would be infinite yeah i think michael was saying that it would probably be not the charge distribution the sigma how much charge per unit area will be some number but it would just keep on going on chris yeah you know that would be a lot reasonably speaking if something goes to infinity all of your homework is easy so there s no purpose for me doing that what is the answer infinity or zero it s got to be one infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge but it s distributed infinitely far away so that s okay now remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field and here s the thing in the first three or four examples or five i guess for some people if i take a closed surface i can learn a lot not everything necessarily but i can learn about what s inside of that infinitively is the first one positive yes yes the next one that i drew was negative absolutely this most recent closed surface it had to be a positive plate shoved in there this last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with to gauge what s happening i don t know everything we ve got a lot of ambiguity and this is why with gauss law we need to use this closed surface we need to look at it from all sides we need to be fully envelop in what s going on or else we might miss something we ll go back again the equation that i showed you last week we ll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes,0.0
on a regular basis have you ever thought about what that causes i mean what causes wind to blow in the first place whether it be a breeze whether it be a hurricane whether it be a tornado would you take a few minutes in your notebook would you just draw a line write after what you wrote and i want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind just do this on your own first what could cause wind to blow take a few moments just on your own just like always guys you don t have to be right here i just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing on a big scale on a small scale anything that you ve got that we can build on anything that you put down alright when you have this discussion in a few moments share your ideas with each other and then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down or what somebody else did talk to each other see what everyone there is thinking what ideas do we have the air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks and it creates wind that s good i think wind develops because clouds carries that air i don t really know much alright folks when we go let s use let s see who gets to share person two we re going to go with person two and let me switch this over here real quick so i can write down some of your ideas hold on alright where d my pen go okay here we go person two and we re going to start over here did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow no table seven sorry i don t know but i said heat and cold air rising and falling cause i know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising heat rising how you get in the air i m really not sure so i m just thinking okay so something about hot air rising and cool air falling and like how they re say that again and cold and hot air going over mountains different land masses okay very interesting now she had the toughest job from now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory a different idea or you can agree or disagree with what miah had to say but you cannot say i don t know okay so you gotta kinda run with what s been said keisha we re going to go back to you first what was your thought at your group well we agree with miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind okay so i m just going to add on here temperature i was going to add pressure temperature okay that may be something different let s see what we can add to this so you re agreeing with miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air yeah okay table three you guys had a different kind of theory we agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure how the wind blows and stuff okay so you guys talked mostly about pressure yeah could you pass that up to table two so far we have two theories one has been agreed to already we have temperature pressure our group wasn t sure but i agree with kavya in how the pressure you re thinking that it s something do with pressure and okay there s an agreement here with temperature as well pass that up to table one prescott what kind of ideas did you guys have well we were talking and we kinda agree with a or hot air rising and pressure and air too but i was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind or carry the air faster okay so let me add something about currents in here cause that s another kind of interesting thing so are currents separate from these two or the same or added on to or they another thing all together just added on i guess okay so we ve got temperature of the air we ve got pressure of the air and we ve got something to do with currents could you pass that over to conner conner what is your thought we kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind like low pressure and high pressure you know that s an interesting thing with the low pressure what would cause air to be different pressures i thought maybe the earth s core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others okay so let s see so you re agreeing with pressure and you re kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity really interesting oops hang on something to do with gravity causing different pressures pass that back to david david what did your conversation involve well i thought the i really didn t know exactly what makes the wind blow but if i had to guess i d say it s air masses meeting let s put that down okay hold on and you threw out something that says air masses meeting alright so when you talk about air masses give us more of what you thought of what that is what do you mean an air mass and when they meet how would that produce wind well i know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm i was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass then when they collide it might produce wind i don t know why that s just my guess no no that s fine so you re thinking when you re saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm but maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind yeah so let me put that on so air masses meeting so since we re talking only about wind right now it s the same kind of air mass meeting alright would you pass that back to ah nathan we re going to have you go since amber already went today back over to nathan nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there well we didn t really know but based on what everyone said i agree with miah that it s the hot air rising and the cooler falling but i also think that david s ideas are kind of interesting i agree with a you re agreeing with a that it has something to do with the temperatures miah what s your thought i also thought what david said cause i know how tornadoes are formed but then i thought air masses are way too big and i know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind and so i think it might have something to do with air meeting together i think that has to do with hot and cold air kind of mashing okay so you said with hot air rising and cool air falling and then you said something about hot and cool air mashing so when you talk about them mashing are they like coming together and like swirling together what do you mean by mashing mixing not mashing mixing yeah just kind of colliding together but not swirling okay so when you re saying hot air rising cool air falling you re saying that those two things are mixing and it s by the mixing together that s what s causing the wind yes okay guys take a second i want you to talk we ve got two more tables to go but i want you to take a few moments talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far and then any questions that come up based on it talk to each other alright guys about ten seconds everybody time and three two and one great ideas so far guys let s go to the last any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had yes well i think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass i mean if you re adding water with water it s just making more water huh so you re saying instead of wind being created you would just have a bigger one and i also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it s two of the different air masses but maybe i think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix you re bringing a couple of interesting things you re saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet you re saying that those are kind of like magnets like opposite sides attract am i understanding what you re saying sorry i mean both of the i m a little confused also i would kind of agree with david now because if i m thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse right so would that analogy be a wind refusing or would coming together be more like the wind i think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass but there s the magnets are the same the air masses are that s really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that which is really cool to bring in let me get the two other theories and we ll come back to that how big are air masses well let me come back to that let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in richard what d you guys end up talking about did it change as you saw these ideas yeah so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity s movement actually we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure you know i m going to because i think that s an interesting theory i m going to put it up here anyway you said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself so with gravity and movement of the earth okay and then once you started throughout this round you re thinking more it has to do with changing pressure okay and you agree with what connor was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure yeah so are you feeling like are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together or does something else cause a change in pressure okay alright that s fine where s the mic can you pass it up here i ll come get it abigail last theory go well at first we weren t sure and we were talking about kind of atoms moving like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining but then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air moving and changing make wind from the combination so you re really mashing it all together so your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other that was the first part and then did that end up causing pressures did you say no like and then the different types of air kinda combined i guess so then molecules move away from each other when you say different types of air so like warm hot and pressure and those combine should i add that to this i don t know tom yeah tom i have a question how would two air masses meet if they didn t have wind to bring them well now that s an interesting question do air masses now that s a really interesting question are air masses just these big masses of air and then wind blows them around because then it wouldn t make the wind if it couldn t if it couldn t come together it couldn t make wind oh now that s a really interesting thing so is the wind oh wow is wind a result of the air masses or do air masses need wind to move well that s a really good question ben you had a hand up i just thought about it and i didn t really want to share the question i just was thinking in my head and i thought through the question alright does anybody have any other theories they d like to suggest other than are there let s go through them real quick so we had the theory that said it s hot air rising cool air falling and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind we had the theory that said it s the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity we had something with currents so it s somehow the currents in the air whatever those happen to be that s what s causing the air to move as wind there s air masses meeting if it s the same what dave was saying if the same air mass meeting that s what causes the wind it s gravity in the movement of the earth which richard and this table suggested although they moved away from it i think it s a valid theory to be suggested and then it s molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things so would you take a moment and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you d commit to as far as which one you think it is talk to each other i don t really know like what matthew brought up how they would move so alright guys here we go would you grab the voter that is registered to you and when you turn it on you should have an a through f option and would you choose one of those to be your theory please is this graded no it s not no we re just theorizing right now so just go with the one that feels best to you what s the question it is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow wait for a few more people to vote oh mark we gotta get to voting patrick you in yep you re in okay mark what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best votes are on your voter and fire away and he s the last one to vote as soon as he goes we ll see what way we as a class think oh you got it okay here we go let s see what you think alright so b is our best theory so far so right now as a group let me save this so right now as a group we are thinking that it is pressure and let me ask you this let me get a quick hand vote for this just out of curiosity one of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity how many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then okay most of the people voted that way look like they re going,0.0
our is like crown crown royal and like it shows like a helmet and like an ad for it and it says he who wears the crown i think that s like if you wear the helmet you will seem cool mm hmm and the helmet is for what do you think motorcycles or cars kind of racing kind of stuff and crown royal tobacco or alcohol alcohol and racing a car thoughts drinking and driving huh well that s bad but they appeal to your your uh love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff but those two don t really mix do they next group ours is tobacco and it has a picture of a firefighter and it says a bit braver so it s trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver and trying tobacco so the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver what do you think could it really work if i chew tobacco am i gonna be able to fight a fire no but firefighting appeals to a lot of young children right that bravery that toughness that rugged fireman thing it s like if i do chewing tobacco i m a rugged fireman type um what are my teeth gonna look like though yellow not gonna look like the rugged fireman type am i fireman sounds like he smiles is that what you said all right um ladies um ours was alcohol and um they got our attention by like the grandma and the daughter playing patty cake and telling stories about her so grandma and daughter and granddaughter playing patty cake lovely little sunny porch sponsored by budweiser oh my oh that s so popular so drink you re appealing to the family nature and the message is drink our drink yeah it says that like all stories weren t about family they also had some other stuff family and budweiser yeah no yeah you re getting it now all right ladies um ours is um there s isn t really an ad there s is a display at a grocery store yeah like there is um a whole bunch of like alcohol in the background and up closer there s tobacco and then there s a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids right next to the the tobacco tobacco okay candy bars like right there and then um also you have pretty much the candy alcohol behind the booth tobacco right up front and candy bars right at hand level kids would probably think that tobacco s candy they might or as good as candy does tobacco come in flavors like candy does yeah no yes it does oh mint berry apple ew really really hey i think i missed a group did i miss a group this one up front nope did i get you guys already did you guys share oh you did share just with me share with the rest of the group it s ours is alcohol and like if you re a rockstar you ll drink like if you drink this then you will become a rockstar what hook did they use the girls in bikinis so how many guys are in that picture one one guy and he s the one who s drinking the alcohol and fifteen girls fifteen girls in bikinis so if the message is if you drink this you ll get hot girls you ll get hot girls yeah all right you ve had a chance to let oh sorry eyes ears mouth thanks you ve had a chance to look at these ads um you ve got a chance to see how they re trying to hook you in you re knowing that the messages that they re sending are slightly warped it s their trick to pull you in but it s your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills weigh it out consider but then choose something else that s healthier so we ve looked at negative influences it s time to talk about positive influences in your life things that can help you say no to all of that no matter how appealing it is no matter how many girls in bikinis show up leave your cards right where they are in the center it s time to take a look at the charts that are around the room there are five of them these are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs alcohol tobacco like a social activity um something you can do with someone else ideas have a sleepover sleepover good all right so in just a few minutes we re gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings we re gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this can anyone name one physical activity something you can do that would be instead of using drugs a positive thing football yeah did you want to share too go ahead um riding your bike around the block good you re on the right track guys keep those ideas in your head when you get to the chart you ll have to write it down what s something you can do with your brain a mental activity that would be positive chess chess i like chess math not for everybody i understand um this chart over here says emotional what s something you can do um that can make your emotions feel better your passions or whatever how can you support yourself emotionally so you can say no to this trying to think happy yep positive thoughts watching emotional movies definitely gets your mind off those i know you got great ideas and i m gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes so save them in your head okay the last one is spiritual spiritual somehow you can nurture your spirit so you have the ability to say no to negative influences go to church church all right save it you ll get a chance time to look at your pencils again leave your papers right where they are okay face up this time we re gonna go by color and you might notice that there are markers at each station for the right color so when you get to the station if you are patience i promise i ll explain it no worries when you get to your station we re gonna start with your bag of colors you will take your bag of colors and your marker and you will only use your color marker so if you are a green guy you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first you ll write down however many ideas you want you ll talk it out with your group you might notice mitchell that i also put group work uh reminders up here about how to work with others in your group one everybody has the right to speak so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to and to write it down the topic don t interrupt give everybody a chance to share their side two everybody has the right to be respected we re not looking for put downs we re looking for ones that can encourage us positive things so when you re getting ready to write positive things speak positively to each other as well and three everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict so if you re having a difficulty in your group talk it out work together to solve that problem if it s not working and you can t solve the problem who can you turn to for help you me and others in your group so if you re a green person you re gonna get one green marker and there are multiple in here in case your marker doesn t work get a different one write down whatever ideas you want when you hear me say switch or rotate you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock take your marker with you so there ll be multiple colors on here you ll get a chance to write on every one yes how does this work are you supposed to write it down like a list you can write all over that paper yeah anywhere as long as we re on the front everywhere all over that paper so you can all be on there at the same time as you want you can take turns you can arrange however you and your group want to you each can have a marker though there s plenty of them for everyone yellow s are over here at emotional um i believe blue s are social purple s are physical and oranges are mental questions before we begin think about something to do besides you ll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute so listen for me to say switch keep writing until i say it go here how about we take this and put it on the floor does that work better i know it s going everywhere isn t it here you go you guys want to take that one down too put it on the floor so it s a little easier to write on yeah good i know isn t it cool yeah so i see you got chess on there anyone think of some other ones other mental ways to use your brain things you can think about it think of school kind of activities things related to learning using the brain spelling you can practice your spelling you can do your math i think you guys are in right place you have a lot of good ideas tell me your favorite one so far give him a spot good how do you spell baseball oh online the playstation yeah that is definitely a social event i ve got xbox live so social means involving what talking to other people human beings a relationship with them all right ready in 10 nine finish what you re writing eight seven six taking your marker with you in five oh our marker four yep your writing in your color three two one rotate spiritual all things that are spiritual what does that really mean your spirit your spirit yeah it could be feelings i think we did emotions though right yeah so this one would be more nurturing your soul yourself we ve got meditation we ve got mediation right yoga oh yeah why don t you write that one down how do you spell yoga yes perfect the bible poems how much do you connect with your spirit or your soul any other resources or people pastor from a church friends you know from the church or wherever you attend services who else besides a pastor can lead um a group you can pray pray good you guys are on the right track emotional support where can we find emotional support family friends good who are some other resources for emotional support culture how can we nurture your own good feelings what do you do to feel better cuddle your pets cuddle your pets you know that one s my favorite too it s okay you don t have to spell things all right capping markers ready to move 10 nine eight seven six ready gentlemen in five taking your marker in four three two one rotate,0.0
so good morning everyone good morning good morning today today what we have is we re going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced one was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that s required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent okay and so we had a field trip to wastewater treatment plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they re doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city so today i m going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates the overarching question is up on the board if you d like to see it it says how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws the environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city so i ll discuss the format of our debate first and that s again up on the board i will be finishing up my introduction here and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves who they represent and what their major goals are for today s debate okay then we ll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story so that our city council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said so city council members please be writing your notes when we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate it s going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing okay at the end each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today s debate good and then as i said at the end we will have a vote city council will vote on whether we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city are there any questions before we begin okay excellent and so i believe the this side had choice and so that means that corbin and his group for representing industry will be allowed to have that closing the last closing statement today and so we ll start with tyler and then we ll try to go back as fairly as possible back and forth so tyler if you d like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you re here today our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate we believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted the hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled while it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option excellent so corbin we re ready to hear your side and who you represent our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate we hope to persuade the epa and city council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness and that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that outstanding and so and then we will begin i guess then with tyler who can go ahead now and you can ask your first question and we ll be looking for city council members if you have any questions that need to be clarified statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it please raise your hand and we ll make sure that you get in immediately okay this is so funny okay we figure that since you say that our waters don t really need to be it already meets the standards of cleanliness but already in colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered as the more chemicals because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry have already become endangered and extinct and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water s clean enough okay let me ask you this do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish we have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the epa the standards that they re trying to enforce now like we saw on the video this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae algae blooms start to produce so it s mostly the nitrogen phosphate that s preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe technically okay i d like to follow this up with an article from i believe this is from the gazette which is our colorado springs newspaper since we re focusing this debate on colorado most likely our city we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms says the writer of this article so therefore when you talk about algae blooms we don t have a problem with this so why should we be focusing on it because the water runs off the lakes that does cause a problem with us okay but even if we did have i mean a few like i said again our city does not have problems with these so we can t therefore we can t focus our debate on these things because it doesn t apply to us well that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don t have problems with algae blooms but i ve been in the mountains around our area and i ve seen many lakes ponds just completely covered with algae and scum and that so many of our local creeks monument valley park and stuff are just littered with gross algae and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot and the same thing happened in the 1960s with lake erie and it later happened with chesapeake bay like we saw in the video and the same thing was happening where they said we don t need to fix it everything s fine and then just as nothing nobody did anything the lake soon was dead and it was like there s no fish in there and the water s just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes so doing nothing isn t really okay so i m gonna interject what i m hearing is that there s a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue so i d like to hear from somebody in the city council area who will be making a vote today how about your thoughts about the current water quality what you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently right now what level of danger are we at have you heard a lot about this do you feel like we are in need of serious change so we can direct the rest of the debate okay anybody who would like to contribute okay stephan well all i know is that where we re located we re at the we re pretty much the first people that use our water and then it goes downstream for other people to use it so so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution the pollutants that we put into the water it s not it wouldn t be really affecting our city but the cities that are down the stream from us okay but this article says that our excuse me i think i read this wrong our state does not have a problem with algae blooms regardless of the algae problem it says without the oxygen the fish bugs and other organisms that live in the water will die and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life but that s a worst case scenario that we don t have right now and we haven t had and it s not an issue in colorado granted it might be an issue in like chesapeake bay or lake erie but we don t have it here it says so and multiple scientists have backed that article as well now corbin do you have any measurements or do you have some values that you can back that up with not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous i tried to find some but i found so does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this okay i would like to comment on i m sorry behind you i just called on her oh excuse me so even if it s probable wouldn t you want to prevent it from like happening here with the algae well if it s not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening yeah if it happened but it hasn t happened yet yeah but what she s saying is it might happen yeah i mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might i mean i could say that you know an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow it might happen we don t know if it s going to happen but fish and other organisms are dying it is happening it s not necessarily just the algae but it s the future problem we ve already seen issues with the yeah let s see what nina has to say as far as city council well i just have a question wouldn t it be better to be safe than sorry you re right it would be better to be safe than sorry but like i said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the epa required standards so therefore it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the epa but we re saying that the epa standards need to be improved yes yes we realize that because they re not they re too low and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams and those chemicals are getting through how would you go about doing this how would you go about stopping the pollution because something that s important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it s something that s misconcepted is for example cars people think cars pollute the air and it exactly does pollute the air but when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it s also a pollutant therefore industry s not the only people who are polluting the lakes it s actually u s citizens doing the same work too okay i like that and so can you be more specific did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains yes that may cause issues yes okay i ve got a whole bunch of them alright corbin why don t you share then what it is you want me to read all of them or just so we re not focusing just on one group there may be other groups as well but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate go ahead corbin well the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he s found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants some of those examples were railroad ties dentures and he found a live person inside of them one time so it s not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there it s you can t stop humans from putting out waste and a lot of the stuff that they re putting in there that they re actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion which some of the machines there do do are poisonous things like fluoride which actually the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually mason which is right up there and lead and mercury and it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion well first of all i would like to answer mr dunmar s question or mr waz question i m sorry we do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water and it s 10 parts per million so that s just to answer that question and then to move on to yours yes of course as you said in your own words you can t stop people from the pollution that they do cause however it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment and when we don t have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people but for also the wildlife for the economy for you know natural systems that occur within colorado it s all you re putting it all on the line okay let s talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water okay well let s talk about the costs that everybody s the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying before you talk about cost would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying okay i would like to comment on that that s an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution i do have a statement from the secretary general of the united nations ban ki moon says more people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war you just said from the united nations yeah this isn t yes we re talking about a local issue now but that is a statement that proves that okay i would like to comment on this once more when you said united nations that s okay i m sorry we re going to have to go to hand raising i believe because we re getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish so theo finish up and then corbin will follow behind you no i made my point okay well like you said you do realize that s a local issue but the u n is united nations of the world so that s not a local issue you re bringing up a fact that s from countries like africa that don t have clean water at all nonetheless water so of course they re going to die from water poisoning but here in the united states we have the cleanest water in the world no matter where it is and colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water if you will out of all the states yeah because of the regulations we have in place and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water we need to restrict our regulations what are the new chemicals yeah they ve been there for awhile we re having new problems though can you explain it everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous it hasn t been an issue before why is it an issue now it has been an issue it absolutely has it has happened all over the united states okay when we talk about nitrogen we re talking about if we restrict that we re talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here as we all know that we are we do grow many crops in our state and nitrogen mostly where it comes from is fertilizers used in that industry so to say that we re going to restrict nitrogen would be we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food such as what what industries for fertilizers fertilizers you can t use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have and not even lawn crops crops lawns anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains which go into creeks which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was so shouldn t the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities we re already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into okay so will i hear you re saying that we re doing a lot what was learned on the field trip specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city what role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant and how does that affect your group s goals for today s debate what are the scientists doing specifically and how does it support your side like they said on the fieldtrip they use bacteria e coli to break down the wastewater that s in the water it s not like they re adding pollutions to it their job is to take it out which they are trying to do by doing that they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it but they remove a lot of those afterwards it s not like to clean it 100 it s going to cost 25 billion dollars and that s just for the state of colorado okay let s see a city council members i m trying to get to them quickly i m sorry amanda behind you stephan where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars this is from the gazettte the gazette article it s from the article science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water which is you guys s goal to restrict it it s going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all if you just want to do parts of it it s still going to be 2 46 billion dollars which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water wouldn t that be better tough than having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy well i actually on the fieldtrip i asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into fountain creek and what we re doing for the environment and they said the water they put back into fountain creek is the water they get out of it it s cleaner than that yeah so in my opinion that statement is totally absurd we re putting cleaner water for nature and nature seems to enjoy it more as i asked the chemist as well and farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops and it helps their crops grow more than fountain creek s streams already excellent point corbin why don t we try alexis and see what she has to say i have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy you can say a lot about the economy what do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy well you say that,0.0
a lot of people thought the mass of the water in the bag would be less than the mass of the ice cubes in the bag how many people one two just three of you okay cameron do you want to start us off with your reason why because the cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer then that water bottle will like explode because it has so much ice in it okay so because the water when it freezes expands then therefore you re saying it has more mass yeah when it s frozen yes but when it melts it doesn t take up so much space so it has less mass yes okay michael do you or are you on the same idea as far as more as far as thinking there s less was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it s going to be less mine was the same same idea yeah okay hannah you got a thought or something well isn t it like the same isn t it like the same thing because it s the same thing it s just expanding but it s going to have the same mass when you re saying it s the same thing what do you mean by the same thing like if you have water in a water bottle like it does expand or whatever but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass okay so hannah s saying it doesn t matter that it expands it s still the same amount of stuff and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass is that correct kay houston idea on that well about the water bottle thing it would be opposite to this cause when you start with water it takes up the entire bottle but the bag the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag so it wouldn t so are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt are you saying the mass is going to go up it s going to increase yeah okay colby i d say that when a solid turns into a liquid its form changes but not its mass okay so kind of the same idea as hannah only you re talking about the actual forms then it can change form without changing mass hannah says it s okay to expand because it s still the same amount of stuff okay michael s got another thing thing to talk about well when you put like the water in the bottle and then you like freeze it then you unfreeze it then there s less water than what you started with and it probably would change the mass why is it so you re saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out yeah do you have a reason why that might be well no it s just okay any other ideas on this one okay how many people thought the mass would increase then how many people said the mass would increase a couple of you jared why don t you tell us why you think the mass would increase i thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice like if you pick up a bottle of water that s frozen it doesn t weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it okay so jared says that water weighs more than ice correct anybody else have a different idea anna well because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass so if it thawed back out then it d weigh more okay so anna s using the example that she s seen ice floating on water therefore she s saying the ice must have less mass than water correct is that what your e saying mm hmm colby you got something to say about that i have something to say about that it will stay the same going off of what she s saying oh going off of what she s saying okay go ahead then ice is pretty much the same as it s water it s frozen water so it still has the same density as water it s just colder so if it s colder it floats ice because it s cold it floats in the water so you re saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass it has to do with its temperature kay houston well i think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn t completely full there s some air in there okay so houston s saying there s some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand okay anybody else anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the oh sorry anna oh okay i disagree with colby how he said that it floats because it s cold when heat rises and so if it s cold wouldn t it sink if it had to do with the temperature okay so anna s saying that heat rises and cold sinks so you don t think it has to do with temperature yeah okay colby response to that or are you well in water it works differently warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually and cold water s more on the top alright so if you put cold in ice it will float above okay oh i have some hands up now michael well when you re in the lake for example the warm part s on top and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises so you re using your experience in swimming or something in a lake yeah it s colder the deeper you go warmer towards the surface you re saying yeah so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath we float up okay when we have no air we go down okay so you re saying an ice cube has air trapped in it that s what s causing it to float is that what you re saying and hannah were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing yeah so when you put your sweater or something in the water it s like the top is usually more warm colder okay alright now people who think the mass is going to stay the same who are those people who thinks the mass will stay the same gavin why don t you give us the reason why you think it s going to stay the same i think it s going to stay the same because nothing s lost when it melts nothing goes away it s still the same thing he s saying it s going to stay the same because nothing is lost when it melts it doesn t get lost okay anybody else who says it s going to stay the same have something to add gabe i said that just talk louder i said that it ll stay the same because there s still the same amount of water melted or frozen and even if it s in a bag if it melts and tries to break down into gas then it s still in the bag so it won t go anywhere so gabe s saying that it doesn t matter if it s frozen as an ice cube if it s melted as water or even he s even going as far as saying that even if the water liquid starts turning into a gas it s still going to be the same because nothing s leaving the bag is that what you re saying he s going even a step further he didn t even mention anything about turning into a gas but he s saying even if it does that it s still not going to change right houston well i disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top it doesn t freeze all the water okay hannah i agree with what he said even if there s air bubbles in the ice then after it melts the air bubbles it s still in the bag it s still concealed in the bag so sounds like the people who are for it staying it s the same are really sticking with the fact that everything s in the bag nothing s out of the bag or leaving or coming in and then the people who are thinking it s going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid and then some of that s through the temperature michael one more before we move on about how it all stays in the bag well when you melt water it sweats so wouldn t it lose some of that so are you saying some of the moisture s going to be on the outside of the bag like comes off the bag if you have it on the table then it comes onto the table like how it has a okay so here s my question to you then that water that s on the outside of the bag that you re talking about you were saying that water came from the inside of the bag well it sweats from the the compression of the temperature so you re saying that s what s causing the mass to go up then wouldn t that cause the mass to go down okay so that s my question to you then is where was that water on the outside coming from inside how is it getting to the outside i don t know some scientific theory okay does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside yeah do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out james how do you think that water might be getting to the outside the moist is like when it what s it called wait a minute the carbonate the condensation it like seeps out like the air it seeps out so somehow you re thinking it s seeping through the bag colby i know how that happens actually because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it s colder so it ll stick there and just condense there so it ll look like it s it s just water from the air so you re saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside it s coming from the outside which is different than what they re saying cameron did you have any other ideas how it might be getting out there kay alright so we got some different ideas on that one let s move on now to our alka seltzer problem this time last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease let s start with the people who think the mass will increase so people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka seltzer who are those people alright we re going to have kyle start us off on this one what s your reason why kyle well when the tablet dissolves i think after dissolving water will rise and make more make more water yeah okay so kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water and therefore more mass sam different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase okay so you re thinking it s going to increase because you re adding something to the water colby i think it s going to increase because the alka seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass jake you had your hand up for the mass increasing correct do you have a different reason why it s going to do that so basically saying the same thing as colby more gases hannah aren t the gases from the water in the alka seltzer aren t they going to just stay the same good question so what you re saying then is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water so what are you saying the mass will do i think it s going to stay the same actually it ll decrease it ll decrease okay why do you think it s going to decrease i don t know okay who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease cameron why is it going to decrease because the acid from the from the from the tablet the acid from the tablet is going to release gases and the water will go out of the beaker how is the water going to get out of the beaker because the tablet will react with water and the gases will float away but isn t there a lid on top maybe the lid will pop off or something let s assume the lid is does not pop off let s assume i have it on there tight enough that it s not going to pop off then since air is lighter than water then that means that the air that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much and there will be more gas in the container so correct me if i m wrong so you re saying that assuming the top stays on it s still going to decrease that s the decrease right because the solid and liquid are going to turn into gas gas and gas is lighter than solids and liquids is that correct what you re saying yeah alright jared has something to say about that i think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be decrease okay so he s saying that the tablet disappears then the mass will go down that piece that the tablet s bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore kevin what are you thinking pretty much the same thing that the tablet s going to dissolve into the water and so mass will go down yeah okay who thinks the mass is going to stay the same it s not going to change who thinks it will stay the same why don t you tell us why it s going to stay the same i think it s going to stay the same because the water the alka seltzer piece is a water it s just in a different form but everything is still okay so you re saying because nothing s going away it s still going to be the same it s just in a different form so kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water gabe do you have a different reason than that no it was a lot like hers it was the same as hers pretty much yeah okay anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka seltzer one why it might go up down or stay the same before we move on gavin i said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle it ll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water like the same amount okay so you re going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet and since we re turning them into gases the mass will go down james i said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked once it mixes with the water it ll stand making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher the mass will increase because it ll produce the alright let s go to burning paper alright burning paper let s start with the people this time let s start with the people who think the mass will stay the same people who think the mass still stay the same colby s the only one morgan gabe not very many jasmine morgan why don t you start us off for why you think it s going to stay the same i said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it s not going anywhere okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere jasmine you had your hand up do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same i agree with her you agree with what she said colby burning stuff does not add it s still the object but it s more spread apart okay so the mass stays the same you said it s just we re going to take up more space with it okay michael no yes i was stretching hannah i disagree with that because it when it burns i don t know if that s the word for it but how it s causing it all when you burn wood in a fire eventually all that will turn into ashes so i don t think it has the same mass or anything okay james you got some more on that when that paper burns it ll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper and then that ll make it so mass will be decreased okay so given the idea that we re taking the solid things and we re changing them into maybe non solids so either liquids or liquid acids they re not gonna have as much mass as those edward what do you think do you think this mass will go up down or stay the same i think it will decrease decrease yeah and what s your reason for that cause when the paper burns it turns into a gas so some of it and then gas is has less mass than solid objects okay so again back to that gas is less mass than solid objects kayla what do you think increase decrease or stay the same i thought it would decrease like what hannah it ll disintegrate okay so as a quick vote how many people thought on this one oh sorry kevin go ahead also i think it s gonna decrease because the paper s gonna burn and incinerate but also the match when you light the match it s gonna burn too okay some of you maybe forgot about the match i haven t heard you mention it until just now so that not only is the paper gonna burn up but so will at least part of the match okay cause it s burning too alright a quick vote how many people on this one said the mass would go down would decrease and how many said it would increase and how many said it d stay the same so the majority of you are on the decrease side on this okay here s my next question we ve now heard what a bunch of people had to say about each different situation one if it would increase or decrease or stay the same my question to you now is that after listening to all the people throw ideas out there has anybody changed their mind on any of these in other words like maybe for the ice in the water one i was thinking it was going to increase but after listening to every one now i think it s gonna decrease,0.0
how much bigger is one than the other it s like a thousand times it s like four times wait those zeros are really skinny well they weren t too bad it s quite a big difference isn t it so is our picture drawn to scale no no can we make judgments on what s happening by our picture no not unless its drawn to scale right rachel how would we redraw that to make it more in line with our numbers which side is bigger the one with the negative okay so we want to make that three times seven to the sixth minus six much smaller right yes would you please redraw make it about a fourth of the size i ll try you can just do a new one don t forget arrow tips please okay now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side okay so do we use our picture to make judgments yeah okay only if it s to scale thank you ma am okay sam you understand that okay alright now one more thing we needed to do for the yeah go ahead that hypotenuse has got a curve it s okay we ll make allowances he doesn t have a straight edge up at the board okay raci what else do we have to do here find the direction find the direction raci how would we go about doing that okay so tangent no that s fine we can use tangent which numbers will we use then okay and pardon me are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now no we well yeah we re going to we just didn t write it that way to solve for theta we would do inverse tangent okay now what do i tell you always to do with this make sure it s in degrees in degrees a couple of you had it in radians that s because in precal we i understand that but so okay now we have the angle is that the angle of the resultant no what would you do jonah 180 add 180 because it s in the third quadrant drew would you agree with that yes because because the resulting forces can t they can t there s no forces in the other quadrants so the resulting force couldn t possibly be in another quadrant okay but how do we measure that angle counter clockwise from east okay good alright any questions sam question i didn t add the 180 but then i put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest that would be fine so you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is alright now do you guys feel better about this problem okay john can you measure that from i said it was i m pretty sure this is incorrect but 12 and a half degrees west of south i mean now that i realize it s yes you could have i guess it s technically the same thing it would have been west of south did i mark it wrong yeah alright well just show it to me later i might have just missed that angle there okay i ll make that correction for you john okay let s go on jonah jake thank you jonah you re going to the board for this one what should i write we can erase all of number one taylor would you please read the problem for us sure a proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640 what does that say newtons over coulombs okay let s stop there for a second hold on don t erase the nanocoulombs you see the difference between an n slash c and a lower case nc sometimes if you re reading too fast you are going to mess those up i do it myself so always take a good look at the units units help inform you what you have okay thank you at some later time its speed is 1 2 times 10 to the second for a you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton for b how long does it take the proton to reach the speed c how far has it moved in an interval and d what is the kinetic energy at the later time okay so connor calling on you again here magnitude of the acceleration how would we go about finding acceleration normally if i just said connor tell me how to find acceleration what s the first stuff that comes to mind f equals m a f equals m a okay or a equals f over m f over m jonah a equals f over m we re working with a proton mass isn t given in the problem but is that going to be an issue for us no no because that s our table of equations so the mass of a proton 1 67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg so we have that part but we don t have the force so rachel how might we find the force isn t the e equals f over q so we can use the charge of the proton to find the to find the charge and what s e it s a constant no no no its not a constant oh isn t it the 640 newtons over coulombs right and what does e represent rachel the electric field electric field good so if we solve this for force what is that going to be f equals okay you can plug numbers in first too that s good jonah can you slow down for some of us please yeah jonah you re not supposed to be looking at your sheet so put your sheet down what did jonah just write up there okay he went too fast so let s back up he plugged in the variables he plugged in the numbers but do we all know where that equation came from green sheet green sheet and e is the electric field good okay and f force q the charge of a proton alright so now do you all know the charge of the proton it s equal to the charge of an electron very good alright now we can find force right what was the force then 6 13 times 10 to the 10th i got 1 02 times 10 to the ninth that s the acceleration oh my bad yeah i was doing acceleration f equals 1 67 1 024 how did i get this problem right oh there it is right there 1 024 x 10 to the negative 16th and that brings up another good point write your work more clearly right because if you can t follow your own how do you expect me or the ap reader to do that so do yourself a favor make sure its clear okay where do we go from here ann back to a equals f over m and we have force and we have mass now right okay now i have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two a john lead your classmates through 2 b okay 2 b you have do you want me to lead the class i want you to ask questions don t tell us i want you to ask questions okay okay so you need to find time so what equation would you use jonah stop using the sheet no i told him he could use it wouldn t it be velocity equals acceleration times time it is yes oh come on jonah don t it s actually v o times x times t not x v o times t that s right isn t it v o times t you are thinking of the equation for displacement oh yeah x times v o well v o is zero because it s from rest alright drew what would you plug in the speed that you re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration oh the speed is 1 2 x 10 to the sixth and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem into that equation and solve it so t equals no john s leading class what does t equal 1 96 times 10 to the negative fifth negative fifth or negative seven five alright sam you lead for part c read part c you lead part c how far has it moved in the interval and if you look up to the problem nope you don t have to look up to the problem you look up to number b which we just did number b yes you do number b and you look at the time that we just found and that s going to be the interval thank you jonah so how are we gonna find time ann or distance sorry distance why d you ask me a question you told me to ask you a question no i didn t alright anyone else know gretchen you look like you know what s the equation to find distance in number c distance equals velocity times time nope that s not what i got but i guess you could do that you could do that no you can t you can t do that why not because i was gonna do that at first gretchen but then i thought in my head that since the object s accelerating the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel i have an equation you have an equation ann i do what is it how about x equals x the original x plus v o times times t plus one half a v squared so what do we know about v o and x o ann that they are just zero so what can we do to both those first parts of the equation just throw them out the window drop it like a bad habit drop it like it s hot so that would be half times acceleration times time squared and conveniently letter a letter a we found the acceleration which was what drew 6 13 x 10 to the 10 nice is just and the time in letter b what was it raci 1 93 times 10 to the negative so if you pound that out on the calc can we just pound it out you cannot just pound it out because you have to do what miranda i don t know put the square in there change back to degrees oh you snuck it in snuck what in the square i don t think i said the square no i didn t but jonah thank you for saying the square for me pound that out in sig fig wise what do you get i got 11 8 11 7 john if acceleration does matter couldn t you also use the equation v t because i also did that and i got the same d equals one write it on the board please d equals what s d i know it works i just don t know how it works i m going to tell you in a second one half v average times t so why will this also work then let s get some of your thoughts ann because if it s the average then it s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just wait a minute it s the average velocity and really the equation is the quantity vo plus v times t yeah that s what i wrote down right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity so wait a minute if the equation is vo plus v then you just get rid of the no yeah you do v plus vo times t the quantity vo plus v times t would just be v average times t okay let s write the whole equation out john one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t then isn t vo plus v just v average so t equals v average times t not v average no yes but vo plus v divided by 2 oh okay i m sorry i see what you mean i missed that yes sorry but it can t just be final velocity okay is there another equation we could ve used i saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked anybody in this class have one of the other ones jonah did you you could do v squared equals 2 a x so another way v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x right good job so you can see there s multiple ways of getting at the same answer right and d letter d i ll have gretchen lead letter d is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time so what equation would you use sam would it be kinetic energy equals times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared yes and then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was 1 67 x 10 27 kilograms thank you for using the unit and then we found the velocity in letter given or it was given right so 1 2 x 10 to the 6th meters per second thank you squared and then you can just plug that into your calculator sig figs 1 2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second meters squared over seconds squared don t forget you have to square the units kilogram meters squared over seconds squared kilograms meters squared over seconds squared yeah what is kilogram meters per second you have to convert the meters i could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something oh momentum that s not what we re looking for though right no it s not no we re good okay now better understanding yes you gotta stay on top of stuff you can t let those distractions get to you okay pass your quizzes to the front face down i ll put them in your files for you do you want to see i ll take yours separate are we allowed to retake them pardon me can we retake them sure thank you you gave me a minus six well i had everything okay now we are starting the next chapter today so i have some handouts to give to you do we have till this friday to retake the last test yeah and quarter ends on friday so anything you guys need,0.0
well let s say about like a plane a plane can use the wing to like slice right through the the wind making it just fly with ease but let s say the wing was vertical and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall okay did everybody hear what he said no daniel did you understand what jonathan was saying yeah okay so does that make sense to you then daniel yeah okay john about the thing the last part did he say vertical yeah like like like vertical like pointing upwards oh okay what do you think reese what do you think um what jonathan said jonathan would you kind of say it again reese would really like to pay attention and he d like to hear yeah i m saying like like a wing it uses like like like a v shape of a duck of a duck squad like every single wing goes down each part and then it s just like a v okay shayla um i said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn t fall onto the ground okay kelsey um i think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then i think it would just float in space because there s no gravity okay we re kind of yeah ramaji okay i m kind of lost ramaji is lost let s help her find herself no that s a good thing because i ll be honest i m a little lost so tell me where you are like i thought we were supposed to put like why we think they were built not how they were built like like i wrote um i think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help and new aerospace technology helps build modern things okay can everybody understand where ramaji went with her answers kelsey i m totally lost now okay here s what happened okay so let me see if we can find this a different direction um in reading all your different sentences most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying okay or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air okay and so we re not kind of getting where i want to get to so can i for a second kind of change the discussion just because yes john is it like when you take a rocket like on the rocket it has uh two wings and like one tail great so his question that he asked does a rocket have two wings and a tail um here s what s happening mm i thought the vehicles would help you and what i m seeing is having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made and i m not as concerned about how this vehicle is made okay as i am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way does that make sense yes okay so can we go a different way with me for a minute each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table correct okay i know i took yours reese which is why you don t have one now i need to know something okay this vehicle doesn t have an engine okay okay now i want you to think about this for a minute and i want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group i want to know how does this hot air balloon fly how does it get in the air and how does it stay in the air and is it possible you don t know anything about this possibly possibly it is possible okay it is possible joelle you don t know anything about this okay so i want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies okay and i m gonna come around and talk to different groups okay so how does this hot air balloon fly okay so you two start the discussion at this table so discuss that because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don t okay so share in your group okay what do you two know okay has an engine a propulsion engine okay but is that an engine okay so now you can do your discussion what did you come up with over here so the fire blows hot air into the balloon okay without it it would do what it would fall down okay okay so any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise what do you think okay okay ooh that was awesome you are so good today um i think we re now getting somewhere so let s talk about this hot air balloon for a minute okay so i ve heard some different things around the classroom i want to know how does that balloon get into the air nathan the fire in the hot air balloon blows the the balloon up to where it can float down okay shayla do you agree or disagree i agree with that because yeah because you pull on a cord and like it lights up the fire and stuff and then the fire pulls in air and it like shoots it up with the fire so is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon no air is what kind of air hot air hot air is being shot up into this part okay john didn t they say one of those like if you compare they can t jonathan can t hear you oh sorry if you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon they re you use hot air for the air balloon and you use the helium for a small balloon yeah and the it s not really air kind of i thought it was steam okay okay now why would you think it was steam because you know how when you just um when you put like a fire fire in one place it sometimes can turn into steam maybe the fire turns into steam no not the fire but like when it s when it s done ann maria says she thinks you need the word water yeah because when you heat up water then steam comes up out of it because steam is like moisture steam is like moisture that s in the air in the air okay ramaji i agree with you john okay i think what he s saying is because in air and the fire is there or whatever and so then when they re getting pushed up that comes and like then i m lost here okay like then the steam like yeah you were right about the moisture part but it but there is no way that like water is in this there isn t water in there yeah i mean reese be supportive i mean there s moisture in the air but still like fire is a big part of it okay can i ask a question okay do i need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly no no you don t ramaji says no laura says no i said no mariah says no kelsey i m totally lost kelsey it s okay to be lost okay kelsey you re if you re lost you need to know where you are so here s the question what do you feel like you know and understand about what s been discussed so far i thought i was understanding everything until john said i m so confused right now so tell me john was talking about steam john was talking about steam i would agree kevin john was talking about steam so the question is prior to that kelsey okay prior to that what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies basically nothing before that i just think it s steam because of like hot and air because or like there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy okay let s see if i can bring around some concepts ramaji and john can you let me have two seconds okay um we have a concept of this fire that s heating air but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam correct but i m also hearing and i just want to make sure i understand i m hearing that the steam isn t necessary for the balloon to go up john well this is this is how i thought it was steam because you know how sometimes there s clouds and you you want to go up in the air balloon and sometimes it might rain like when you re in the air balloon sometimes it like when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot it actually turns into steam i think okay ramaji okay listen i ve got to come over here okay so like like you two can put your hand down for a minute and i ll go to you next so like steam is i think it s putting pressure like on the balloon to like make it go up so we feel like we have air pressure okay i don t agree with ramaji though because with the air there s no steam involved there s like kinda like what john said he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it okay i m gonna ask oops i didn t let you speak well like it s just like like comparing this to a regular balloon with helium it would float up just like an air balloon but you can t put helium in an air balloon does everybody understand that so if i put okay that is an awesome analogy so everybody listen if i put helium helium is a a gas a gas okay helium is a gas so if i take a regular rubber balloon and i put helium in it the helium because it s a gas helium floats that makes my balloon float right whereas if i just blow up a balloon what happens it just falls down on the ground and i got nothing okay on the flip side kevin what she s saying is with a hot air balloon instead of filling it with helium i m filling it with hot air okay now i have a question i think you ve got to think really deep about this one if hot air reese is what makes my hot air balloon go up okay i want to know would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day just think about it for a second just think would it be easier for my hot air balloon do you think to fly on a hot day or a cold day what about on a windy day ooh okay she said what about on a windy day let s assume that there s a slight breeze on either day okay but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold okay kelsey i personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher so i d get radiation into the balloon okay ramaji i think a cold day and why on a cold day because like there s not i mean even on hot days there s still like low humidity sometimes and so like it you basically with fire would kind of i don t know not set your hair on fire but like no when it s cold there s no moisture in the air so like it would be like like helium but like okay shayla i think that it s a hot day one of the reasons is because there s hot in the hot air balloon and if it was on a cold day there s a fire in the thing in the hot air balloon it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground and people could die okay ann maria i think it would be better on a cold day because well i don t know if this actually really makes sense but like the hot air would be working against the cold air exactly and like if it s on a hot day it would be like the same just a second so ann maria if the cold if the warm air is in the hot air balloon and it s a cold day what would you expect to happen to the balloon go up and why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day because like the hot air would be pushing against the cold air faster than it would be pushing against itself okay over here i agree with shayla on the hot day because like a regular air balloon just regular heat would make it go up but if you had the sun hitting against it i think it would help with radiation like the sun would help out the fire yeah how it has something to do with radiation okay i think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher okay nathan i think on a cold day because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air that might pop it awesome kevin what do you think i think the same hot air because i ve never seen a hot air balloon fly when it s cold okay dakota oh wait kevin i have a question for you how do you define a cold day okay what s the okay here s my question okay you said you d never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day and what i m asking is is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold winter winter okay dakota what do you think uh i think uh kevin dakota can think on his own i know he can i don t know cold day warm day what do you think i think a warm day because it would be easier to fly okay daniel what do you think cold day warm day i would say a cold day because the hot air would meet the cold air so it would be more enhanced going up you d get more from the hot air okay i need to kind of bring this to a close real quick and i know you two have lots to say tyree did you want to add the last comment yeah uh i think the hot day because who would go out on a cold day when the higher you get the colder it gets okay tyree says who would go out on a cold day because the higher you get the colder you get so tyree s logic here is that if i m going to go in a hot air balloon i don t want to get really really cold okay ladies i know you have lots to add okay but i kind of want to bring this to a close but i need to know a crucial question so everybody has to commit to this question i want you to don t do it until i tell you to ready you re gonna hold um you re gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day and you re gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day i didn t say go yet okay on three everybody so does everybody understand this is cold this is warm okay ready one two three okay okay now hands down i have just two more questions and then we re gonna close out today s lesson okay question number one i want to know if you ve ever heard the word,0.0
how you guys doing so 3 oh what did you do by touching those it made a short circuit it crossed wow the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple yeah it s only 3 why do you think that is 03 maybe because it s like different rods or something oranges are more sour than the other fruit not and like have more acid or something because it stops the energy we want it a half centimeter apart right yeah two centimeters around so okay go ahead make sure they aren t touching 0 1 it s not even measuring at all oh 0 1 0 01 oh 01 that s crazy i know how this supposed to be one the other two were so high 0 98 i never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy except for oranges i thought this would have as much as the apple my hypothesis i actually thought that the orange would have the most go ahead alright lizzy you can do the voltage reader stick them in a half centimeter apart and a centimeter in okay lizzy make sure they don t touch don t short circuit them it s like completely zero the bigger it is the more volts it has the middle one it left like a little here and this was the most i think it s more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else hmm i wonder why that would be okay so now we have to get a calculator okay so 0 22 plus 0 09 plus 0 28 i got 0 1966667 so what are you gonna do with that number round it up okay 0 20 but wait doesn t someone else need to try it oh yeah yeah yeah that s a good idea 0 22 plus 0 oh never mind divided by three i got the same answer so what was the answer to the investigative question what do you think the the apple had the most do you agree with that yes why do you think that is do you have any guesses it s it s bigger it could carry more volts it has yeah it has like more juice yeah that s true i think the juice was your hypothesis correct actually it was like right here well well actually i said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with but i guess apples would work better what was yours i thought the i thought the carrots would produce more because you know usually when you like eat one it s like very wet wet when you just get them so i thought the carrot was going to win but guess not i thought it was the apple i already said that my hypothesis i thought i think the potato would have the most because i heard like i ve heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts so i suspected that they may have been have a lot of voltage also okay to our investigative question our question was which fruit will produce the most energy and the kiwi kiwi and apple had tied for it 0 98 so i don t know maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results i wonder why the orange was so low though maybe because we since we put it too deep or something no we did the same thing we put all of them yeah i know well so then our so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest so how about your hypothesis i thought orange would have it i thought orange would have it i thought orange had it too and had the highest why because it had like i thought the apple would because we didn t i thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was how about you kirsten what did you think i thought the orange because it has more citrus in it i mean yeah i would have thought kiwi would have less because it s so small yeah me too that s what i thought then what was our evidence apple had for an average had 0 98 orange had 0 16 and then kiwi had 0 06 0 16 and then kiwi had 0 98 so kiwi and apple tied and then our evidence is our data table because that s where we recorded everything yep so then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation we did them the same length apart and so what are you guys trying to figure out over here we re we re trying to figure out what if the apple carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery what is the food representing in this case a battery okay yeah okay how you gonna figure that out what is your plan we are gonna do gonna try to do a voltage reader and put try to see how much voltage there is in an apple potato or a carrot i think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage well like the apple but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an s battery series series let s do series let s try series it lights up more yeah it s brighter okay let s get it done oh wait we re gonna need more there s a wire in here so i think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter or at all because it has i think it s gonna have the most it has the most voltage and so it ll make it become brighter which do you oh wait we re doing a series battery so maybe we where s the other apple it s over there reece has it need to wrap it around tight can i check jayden do you wanna do it sure i ll have the honors keep this one untouched because i m gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to this negative just the white one okay there is no wire in this okay so i think we have enough wires here what do you need the wires for to wrap around to make a series to allow the energy to flow through okay so what s the purpose of the wires so that the energy will be able to flow what is the energy that s going through the wires electricity but okay so what is the function of the wires to like be able to pass from one spot to like the battery to the light okay so you have two different wires why is that to be able to you know why you have two different wires um no no i m gonna give you a minute to think about it okay is it working no not yet well i don t think it s working i think i didn t oh it s going no i don t think i wrapped the wire around right oh yeah because the this is really short so yeah it was tucking it let s see that and that and that yeah that thing s wrapped up tight well if the volts are enough don t the apples have to be touching no they don t have to be touching they just have to be the wires just have to go from positive to negative yeah true but if they don t have enough voltage we should use a potato yeah we can put the potato to help yeah we need to put them in every fruit and then connect the wires like that to that that to that so make sure they don t touch yeah so kinda wrap it around with the wire yeah try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that do you what do you guys think do you think that fruit could power our school i don t think so it might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here but you don t think there s enough voltage to supply our whole school no well like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something i don t know how that would turn out but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top would you think that would be economical you think that would be beneficial to us in any way maybe why it could but we d have to keep changing out the fruit and changing out the fruit it d be lots more work that s for sure don t let them touch that connects to that and that do we have another one because this one is broken can we borrow one from over here oh we have one there you go what do you think is gonna happen i think it ll like because we have none of the same touching first we should check the voltage well i don t we ll just see if it lights the light no don t connect those why would you wanna check the voltage just to see if it has enough potential of battery would make more electricity all the averages i think it should be good this way because we tested a battery and saw how much it was connect one to it then connect yours lizzy maybe did we do it wrong no i don t think so well i think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit maybe it try an separate those a little more kirsten maybe they re both plus and plus maybe it s because we re using three types of fruit if we use just two what if we took the prongs out and replace that with this okay try that put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it well don t what are we trying to do here we were trying to make all these the same one why would you do that maybe because they need to be the same from the both positive and negative oh and we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus doesn t matter which way and that and that needs to touch and then that one and that one which is exactly what we did but wait,0.0
what were you saying joe i said young people definitely benefit our society overall more than old people in the country why just because they can progress contribute more yeah like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people yeah they re a lot more active compared to old people more who just is gonna basically sit at home i mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling the rebellion is completely composed of the youth yeah if we look at the political situation in america like obama s election was pretty much the 18 to 21 year old vote it s just like clearly they re like better at affecting social change in this time period that we re discussing why would you want the youth to come well because this is like the start of all social change in the union and i want young people to bring a youthful energy and determination and some sort of hope about the country that they re moving to and that all my union in here they re gonna progress they re gonna like technology and they re gonna invent stuff so you re onboard with the i m just saying we still need more money they re going to be working and they re going to be taking money out of our economy because they re gonna want to pledge how much are they gonna spend like we need old people to spend a lot like rich people to spend but we need workers yeah no so it s like we need workers old people cannot work we need a combination if only get young people if we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with the old people on this list aren t that rich yeah but there s the bottom line is gonna be more than just the old people there the old people other countries but right now we re focusing on that they re going to be moving and they re rich who would move here why would they move to the land of opportunity if they don t need opportunities i didn t mean to say that that s honesty okay yeah but i mean i see that it seems like the majority did the majority rule on that because i guess who was against having younger people come in i know matt was was matt the only one who wanted older people to come in ok and you were also i m a loner you just went with the consensus yeah okay good another point another point also old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life aren t necessarily going to be all that interested in america okay as a country and wait and also they re not going to vote they re not going to you know try to participate in the country itself so they re just here to die in comfort okay go ahead darvel on the way it s already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the united states because so many people died on the way getting there so they might die on the way getting there so don t even consider them to begin with right or if they re sick they can t come into the country anyway like we re not going to let people who have cholera into our country because then it ll start spreading here so you said colema or column isn t that more in cholera that s like okay i was like what what else did you guys have on your cards what about religion does religion matter no i don t think it did no no that s one thing we i think we all could agree on yeah oh everybody what about the nativists what about the nativists darvel you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group well i mean it s kind of like on the edge of the he s conformed but i because most of the time it s christianity in the united states so also majority rule yeah majority rules usa usa okay so who did you guys decide to wait was that the end of your criteria or no we had there s still reasons for coming race and knowledge of english previous jobs and oh what d you guys say for english what d you guys say they have to know english yeah we said they had to know basic english at least at least a little bit they have to know some of it or enough to you know find out where the bathroom is really or enough to like communicate or have the ability to learn it with other people who may not know english that well and boss you were okay i mean i feel like i m one of the only ones who disagreed with that because like being a boss like i have connections like in every part of my city and every community and communities are often like separated by race so by race and and language mm hmm so maybe different communities wouldn t have trouble communicating if they only knew one language mm hmm but being a boss with my connections i could definitely like i could make it so that they could communicate and i can get them what they need help them out okay i don t think now english is a necessity well you wouldn t i think it s pretty i mean how are people supposed to communicate and it s just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it because i mean overall the majority speaks english but we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages so they could just they re getting by though right right i don t know if you should know them working in factories you should know a lot of these people yeah but you might even know someone when i think of like different languages i think of like the tower of bavel or babel it s like in the bible story where like everybody spoke different languages and then the tower collapsed so like if everybody speaks different languages we can t get work done productively because we don t know what each other want like if we say yo go make this type i don t know just do this job and then they do something else you need communication darvel what do you think about the language piece well i think that speaking english is basically it s a necessity i mean obviously you would want workers to come in because he just wants money he doesn t really think communication is that important but as a nativist i believe that it is why what will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages maybe be different races different ethnicities what will happen to the country if we let those people in i mean that could create like conflict between the work because like matt said they really wouldn t know what to do while they re working also that could change the patriotism of the country as well but will they know why they re working not really so people who don t speak english don t know why they re doing a specific job well probably yeah i mean they know that they re doing a job to get money right so does english really matter i m just asking i mean they re not gonna really x you wouldn t care if they spoke english because if they didn t speak english it might make it easier to exploit them i somewhat care because they have to collaborate with the people they re working with to get the job done the way i see it is they can come into the country with a you know as long as they have the mindset of i should probably learn english to succeed in this country then i think it s a good idea because if you re going to be immersed in a language you re going to be able to learn it eventually so i mean as long as they try to learn english or try to know basic english i think they should i mean i think i agree to darvel like if i was a nativist i m not saying i am but if i was a nativist i wouldn t want hoards of people who don t speak english coming because i mean it s like america s pure we ve got everybody speaks english like we don t want but does everybody really speak english right now not now i m saying no not right now in 2011 but in our age that we re discussing if i was a nativist in my even then right in my like ideal world you would want everybody to like speak english okay the whole world should speak english oh goodness yeah that s what a nativist would say i went with the english speakers because like to properly rebel and have a voice communication is vital and i think that people who aren t speaking english won t be interested in what i have to say can t even understand what i m saying so okay well you guys decide and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically okay yeah all right thanks guys oh we already did education s not really that important to me though i think it s really important dude it s saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren t educated to begin with well education like you would want educated people as a non union worker like i don t care about education i just want to keep my job and i want like union workers to get out of the country and as a union worker i want educated immigrants because then they would stand up for themselves and like change factory conditions me being a tycoon i just want people to work for me i mean they can come to this country they can live the american way i ll supply them with a job what s the american way american way is to well but you re not giving them any money wait wait wait what s the american way 2 5 kids we are actually 2 5 kids white picket fence dog well that s the american is that the american way now or then we re talking about then labrador basically the american way is i want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in okay that s my concern well but they came here to like succeed and you re giving them like two cents an hour i mean for me with education though it s not that big of a deal because then again if they re coming to america they re going to have to learn our customs and our way and with them being uneducated that s easier for us to mold them into society and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for and stuff like that but this is supposed to be like a free country and they came over here because we like grant that and we re just like manipulating them yeah but like basically the only people i want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs like people who are kind of like who are those people kind of like sketchy people kind of because like you want sketchy people to come into your country well sketchy people are about to give me jobs because like sketchy people are about to like what do you mean by sketchy what does sketchy mean when you re saying sketchy do you mean poor or like nah i mean like people that are like rich and stuff and they ll like have a business and whatever but like they re corrupt a little yeah they re a little corrupt so they won t like hire union workers and they ll keep their people ununionized so i can come in and take the work make that cash know what i m saying oh okay so you want it that people will have money when they come into the country but not be on the side of unions exactly so that they will they ll give me jobs they will okay they ll hire non union workers they re not people that are going to be entering the workforce they re people that are going to be like already kind of upper you know what i mean okay so you want people with money coming into the country yeah exactly okay did you guys decide on a criteria already yup or are you discussing a criteria we have a criteria this is our criteria pretty much okay what s your criteria we said non educated which some of us don t agree with who didn t agree with it i don t agree with that why because i did not agree with it america is the land of education everybody needs an education you can t come here well but at this time remember education is not like going to school it s more of knowing a skill or a trade it s like street smarts almost well if they don t know anything then they can work yeah okay and we decided on that do people really need to know a lot though to work in these factories no but like no my business is to teach them how to use these machines we don t want them to be taken advantage of i mean but at the same time i don t really see the importance of education if they don t come with like money or some type of like i don t know some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in america because you may know you know how to read 100 books but that doesn t help you like start a business or something like that yeah yeah but not like that kind of education like education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay like so they can stand up for themselves and like be able to like negotiate with you why is that not okay i mean everyone has to get paid everyone gets paid that same amount yeah but they re living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions i mean that s in your opinion a house is a house yeah and then look at where they re coming from they re coming from religious persecution they re coming from these governments that are collapsing these war stricken countries exactly and the government i think it s better to work in a factory earn some wage yeah but how much are you earning compared to them eat or have necessities in life i mean but there s also government support too that s where i come in i set them up with a place to stay stuff like that you know that s what government s here for is support of people that come in here so it s best when they re not educated it s best when they don t have money because that makes it easier for them to get help and that s what we re here to do is to help people but then they re relying on you and they don t know what to do with themselves like when you they re relying on him but then he lets them rely on themselves so they come in rely on him and then he kind of sends them like how helps them out how does he keep people from relying on him because then all right so i can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives like if there s a politician voting for labor laws i can help them if i m with that politician i can yo this is the guy you want to vote for this is the guy that will help you that s like brainwashing though they like have a right to think for themselves honey this is america exactly exactly exactly so you re saying that nobody should campaign ever you re saying campaigning is brainwashing no you could campaign but you don t exactly he s just campaigning can i just say something no but he s like getting them all to agree with him okay if you think about it this way you can really have people from all spectrums of money wise like from all kinds of economic backgrounds you can have the more rich people come in sorry the education backgrounds the more educated people are going to come in no matter what they re going to help our country more than hurt it then for me i can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education and i can give them a job i can start them off in life and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves why don t you better their working conditions then if you like are helping them because i mean still this is much better no because they like die in those factories it s better than being killed by their previous governments wait have we decided no it s not it s not the same thing have you guys already decided on this piece already yeah we have like our set laws we just have disagreements about that you guys have disagreements so you guys were able to a consensus on them yeah well we kind of voted on it we decided that they have to be non educated come with some sort of money their religion and race doesn t matter come with a family,0.0
think out loud what are we doing ok you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to how do we do that take 196 divide it by four hold on let me hear from somebody that i haven t heard from need to find the square root of 196 ok why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four because all sides are equal well if all sides were equal that s why we would divide by four because to find the area of the square you have to square it so the opposite of squaring is square root so we would divide by four if we were given the perimeter if we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four but we were given the area so we need to square root 14 ok so the side lengths are 14 multiply times 4 it s 56 anybody see a problem with this ok so this side is on the inside of the figure so it doesn t count so instead of doing 14 times 4 we do 14 times 3 how do we find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi r divided by 2 2 pi r divided by 2 how do you find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi r divided by 2 so the radius that means 7 7 is 14 2 times pi times 7 so that should be 2 times 3 14 so the whole thing is 53 38 so then 2 pi r divided by 2 i got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14 so 14 divided by 2 is 7 here skye can you take this thank you put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem c squared ok all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal how many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure don t you got to work it into two rectangles i think it d be easier of you did it the long way does it matter which way you split it either way you re going to have to split something right you can determine either of the missing sides in order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply 7 times 6 is 42 where is i don t see a 7 in my problem ok but what does 7 represent i don t see a 7 what is it represents the length of this what length from the line on down to 6 ok could you label that with a 7 cause i still don t see 7 it said how many one inch squares ok so you want to multiply what by 12 87 87 times 12 why but you made the 12 into a 7 ok so you want to do where are you all getting 12 from a foot is 12 inches there s one inch not twelve oh because i found the 87 feet squared i found the area of it but then you ve got to find how many 1 inch so you multiply it times 12 because there s 12 inches in a foot so what are we multiplying with 12 so we re doing 87 times 12 shouldn t you divide though try dividing what do you get when you divide say that again in one square foot there are 144 inches instead of going by 12 which i said originally shouldn t we be doing it by 144 since one square foot is how many inches it is but i ve got 87 square foot but i m saying in each foot there s 144 inches so instead of 12 there are 144 square inches so instead of multiplying by now that i think about it we should multiply it by 144 ok let me ask you guys this what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area could we do it that way yeah ok let s try it that way what would 9 be in inches 9 feet in inches 108 108 what would 5 be in inches 7 in inches 7 feet 84 84 thank you kashmir and 6 72 72 thank you sierra ok we know what all our units are in inches now when we find the area we re going to be finding square inches somebody want to take over from here skye do you mind if you continue writing uhm yeah no i don t mind thank you you can erase all of it my eraser got stolen so do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width right yeah it s what 6 480 it s multiplying but that s wrong though don t you still have to subtract i mean like 84 minus 60 because they re part of the no we didn t convert the 12 we converted the 7 oh ok so it s still already changed good question though what s the total 12 528 i just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct you are supposed to multiply by 144 good job what did you say it was 12 528 how d you get that ok next problem no you have a question yes when you get 1000 when did you have 1 044 oh and then you multiply by 12 again because guess what 12 times 12 is 144 so that s what you re doing you re multiplying by into 12 and 12 right they way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15 from the very very top to the very bottom thank you because now we know that that s 1 inch can t you break it up now that we know the basic triangle in the back that means you re breaking it up into a triangle and a square yes the square on the bottom i m sorry jacob the base of what the base of the triangle in the back but what s the base 5 the height is 5 and the base is 15 well yeah but i was asking jacob what the base of the triangle was can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18 because the width of the rectangle is 10 and i have to add the sides of the triangle,0.0
can someone come up and put number one on the graph and then we re going to debate about it anassia can you come up and show us where you think one should be alright so what i think is i don t know if i m right or wrong or whatever but i thought kinda one is there do you guys see it no ok back can you give us a reason why ok well it says david had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant so i kinda think that from home the restaurant must be close that s why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card we don t know if he has money on him ya know it could depend on circumstances but i think that the restaurant was hella close that s why he went back and went back home ok wait wait wait wait wait wait wait ok so honestly who has that opinion so you think one is at the very beginning mmmhmmm of his trip ok can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place anassia can you pick someone overwhelming you i put it right here right there right there ok can you give us a reason he s driving and then he goes to the restaurant and then he s driving away no this is the restaurant right here and then he s leaving and he s like oh snap i left my credit card then he goes back and then he s driving away that s it ok wait so whose idea do we agree with sidius or anassia sidius ok but we still have to convince anassia because she still thinks it s at the beginning right i thought it was at the beginning too you did who convinced you myself yourself ok so if david is driving back to the restaurant then should his slope be what what should his slope be negative if he s going back to the restaurant right because if i m travelling this way my slope s getting bigger my distance is getting farther but wait i turn back so my slope has to be negative negative so do you think one is when the slope gets negative yeah so are you convinced now anasstia that it has to be negative for him to go back yeah so are we ok with erasing that first one well i have to erase all of it anyway oh ok sorry ok so one should be where he s going back right where he s going negative ok alright is there a real end to it well we re going to see once we get through them alright so sidi can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be no hands i would put two here can you explain why candy wait just give us an explanation yeah because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative he went back close to his house yeah near his house but then it s near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero because the line there represents the distance from his home right i ve got a question ok you know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house we re looking at his car not looking at the tow away car aren t we so wouldn t it be considered constant since his car is moving so i guess the car is on the tow truck right so now wherever the tow truck goes the car has to go right yeah does anyone have a different place for number two no so we all agree that two no do you want to put two in a different place put it in a different place let s see what you think put it in a different place let s see what you think go i was thinking of putting it right here that s what i was thinking that s what i thought too can you explain why why because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house so i was thinking that the first sentence so his car broke down so if he was not going anywhere then the time was going then constant so if as you see the time his speed never changes while the time is just going down that s what i think that s wrong we don t say that s wrong we say well i disagree well so convince him otherwise because the car is still moving and if you look really really closer at the graph the last point isn t directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero also if it was constant that means he would just be in one spot but it s clearly saying that he s being towed back towards the repair shop so he s in motion like the slope is showing distance and not speed well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere so can i say two things one thing so it s a different interpretation of this problem right so if he was broken down and the car was just staying there then would this be a good place for two yes if the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing it s not changing right because time is going on but distance is staying the same however number two says he s going to the repair shop close to his house so is he just staying in one place no right so he s gonna go back home so if he s going back home so this slope would be negative or positive negative negative and it s going here s home right so where does he go back home or very close to home here right are you convinced danny yes ok let s erase the other number two but danny thank you for being brave because i could understand that interpretation alright danny can you pick someone to put number three on the graph ok number three is over here i disagree wait wait we haven t even heard her explanation wendy what s your explanation why because it s stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it s kinda constant here so it can be stopped so why not the long one because he s in the restaurant i suppose but then so if one is here if one is here it has to be in the restaurant then right well then one is over there so then why would three be all the way over there one is here right no no no one is all the way at the beginning no sorry that s y but then it says that he got a three yes but it s here yeah he ate there so wouldn t that be the one like wouldn t that be where he gets his gas number three said that he went to eat but it doesn t say where did he eat maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about yeah maybe he went a bit farther and said ok let me go somewhere else so that s why so what did he do here eat and gas it doesn t take that long to eat one hour people take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can t just eat while they re getting gas oh let me eat while i m getting gas ok so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station the restaurant the restaurant so do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time short shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is right so we haven t gotten to the restaurant yet have we no no ok so could three be the place where he stops and gets gas could it be possibly we don t know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour or maybe it meant five minutes yeah you know you never know so if we interpreted five minutes gas and quick bite quick sandwich could we put three at that place yes why because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time i think that at three he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card maybe the gas station is near the restaurant why you make this so difficult that s possible though right i m like thinking of putting at the beginning here here is four wait wait wait don t go on four yet but i think the three should be before one because you can t just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich ok we re going to do this because i like the debate you re having but i want groups to think about it individually and then we re going to come back but i want to put one thing for sure on the board ok so if if if if if if this is definitely let s say this is definitely where david stopped to eat ok so this is where david is eating eating as in in the restaurant eating at the restaurant yes so here david is eating for a long time at the restaurant ok a long long time so that s the longest is this the longest time where the slope is flat yeah so we re all gonna agree right now that this is where david is eating at the restaurant so this is where david is eating at the restaurant can you put all the other numbers in a logical place because i hear you guys talking about logic like he can t go to the gas station before he does what goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card ok so i see that s one logical statement so in your groups i m gonna give you five minutes for this can you put one two three and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it ok,0.0
take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you re going to be working on and this we want to remind you that it s kind of dinner party conversation ish you agree with people at dinner parties you disagree with people at dinner parties but it s civil because it s friends that you invited over to your house you don t raise your you don t raise your hand at dinner parties you wait until you wait until you wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking of course because that s polite dinner conversation you add on to what one another says but like i said we don t necessarily have to agree and then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party somebody else brings something else up so you can raise your own questions as well so the seminar is open and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of the veldt what did it mean like george having like i think that i know a lot of times where he especially in the towards the back he it goes back a little ways he s like talking a lot of things like comments turning comment commen i can t say that word he says they re going to turn the house down possibly for a month and how he pick out the picture painter and he was telling his he was like talking to his son a lot and like about not about doing what his son would not want to have happen and how he spoiled his children so much so he takes out there s a lot of things that his son his son and daughter it just doesn t say as much wouldn t like because yeah but he wasn t like he wasn t like i agree that oh yeah i m gonna go die today i agree that it was he didn t want to die i agree that it was of course he didn t want to die who wants to die except for if you re suici you know suicidal i agree that and on page 15 where it says um it s mostly on 16 but starts on page 15 won t this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children s affections it assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents and now you want to come along and shut it off kind of shows why that they hate them and because it because it s since the nursery is their parents it s like some guy who thinks he can tell you coming along and can tell you to kill your parents you know it s the same thing as they re doing though they re killing their parents well but they think the nursery is their parents they don t think their parents are their parents they don t matter as much as parents if they d been nice to them and now they re going to turn everything off then isn t it imbalanced so now they re relying on the house because that s what they ve learned to do as yeah it d be like take an example people are killing their parents and on page 15 it says like i also think that it s the dad says i sen the psychologist says i sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now you re letting them die in some way so if they like they don t really know like when someone says no to them they ve been spoiled so much they don t even like well they just can t take it it makes them go all crazy and stuff so they wanted to kill them because they like couldn t fly to new york so yeah because i think and if their parents and if their parents and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents then maybe not but since their parents don t really take care of them it s the house that takes care of them yeah and then the the house and the room replaced their parents yeah their parents and friends it s not like the parents could they don t have friends because they re the room they get all these adventures because of the room yeah they don t have friends and they kind of like rely on the house to give them stuff all the time if the house refused them if it could then i don t think that they would want to kill it i think that it s just because they don t feel like their parents are actually their they don t they feel their parents aren t important to them so when they say no on page on page 13 the mom s saying that sounds stressful would i have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it and brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath the kid s like now relying on everything he s never had to do something for himself so he doesn t really like know yeah he s gotten so like stuck on having everyone do things for him he thinks like doing your own thing would be like a challenge yeah like and i guess you can use an example as wall e a show people get like so fat and they rely on everything so much that like they have to move in chairs and they when you golf it s virtual golf there s a robot for you so they just they take robotics and machines to the next level and they it s all they rely on and so many people don t have to work yeah and weren t the ones that like bought the house that they were actually the cause because they were the ones like on page 5 and 11 they even said that we were the ones who bought the house we were the ones who got us into this mess so but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children which made them mad so again they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house i think it like don t you think that people would be sort of obese like elliot said yeah they would be they would be yeah but then they d be like everyone else in the world but then they also yeah and getting exercise but they re obese and also i think that it s george hadley s fault not necessarily both the parents because the mom didn t really do as much because like well the quote over there it said that like she s the one who let them in for a minute but she just wanted to be nice she just wanted to be nice but i think like on page two it says but nothing s too good for our children george said so i don t think it s as much lydia s fault because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there she just wanted to be nice to the kids because george had shut it off so abruptly but i think it s more george s fault that they spoiled them and that therefore gets himself killed does anyone know when this story was written because i m guessing it was 1950 all right because i was i m guessing it was wri i was guessing it was written when women weren t like thought of that highly because wendy only actually speaks once and is a sniveling idiot most of the time and lydia s and lydia hadley is pretty passive and it s the guys that are have all the action and have anything really going on except in the final scene well yeah but that she on she says one line one line in the whole book basically i know but lydia sort of has a bit of action yeah but she doesn t do much she doesn t like she s pretty passive she doesn t like um disagree with her husband or her kids she doesn t do anything like that she just follows whatever her husband says maybe she has a few opinions but not really and wendy says four words alone in the whole thing so well i mean you hear her screaming but other than that is that a word well that was unless she s saying it close enough at the same time as peter like when they both come in and say hello mom and dad doesn t really count or when they both say mommy daddy come quick but she s saying it at the same time she only says four words by herself in the entire story the screams are actually their parents when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being yeah they realized that at the end but they didn t really make that very clear they re like suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar i thought the whole book or the whole story that it was like the kids screams but it s actually the parents what are yeah because it s really not clear on that i figured that it s actually so they all well i m it s more it s nicer to have like a mystery kind of mm hmm yeah i figured that it s the author s fault the what the author s but how is it the author s fault because it s his story well the author wrote it that doesn t make any sense but carl the author yeah that doesn t make much sense it s not his fault it s the it s totally off topic yeah i agree with elise when i didn t really get who the screams were until the very end where they said yeah that i think it s on page um 19 but yeah that they were it says on page screamed and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar so i thought it was the kids the whole time i thought aaron was saying something before but then everyone what i was going to say is the a little while ago when i was going to ask you why do people think it s like peter hadley or other because i mean the other is both of them because more or less the majority did george hadley so why just those people who did that why did they do that i understand with peter hadley because it is his he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents but it s not his fault he got spoiled he can t help it if his parents spoiled him yeah because actually even if the parents had been played more of a parent role they would still probably have preferred the nursery because you don t need to the parents could still say no and the nursery does they can like do whatever they want with it i agree with the both parents part of it even though the mom wasn t as involved as george was the mother was not do posing a part in the kids life as being the mom and the house was so that caused them to think the house was their parents and the house was their family this is indirectly directly i think you can go directly the peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying directly directly but indirect well directly the lions were oh my god indirectly but directly it was mostly peter but indirectly it was it was kind of everybody s fault i kind of agree with like both the parents and then the dad because in the beginning the parents are like slowly taking away some things like the painter and not letting them go to new york and that kind of builds up their anger but in the end the dad just wants to shut it all off and then the son starts getting really mad and like threatening them finally they like get really mad and then they start imagining the parents dying and then they ve been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing i think it was the parents fault and the inventor because i mean none of it would have happened if they wouldn t have had the just like the super technology house and the nursery so it s technology s fault it s not the inventor s fault because he didn t know but it s not the it s not the inventor s fault that they thought though if he wouldn t have made it it would have never happened and also if the dad wouldn t have bought it it would never happened too so that s my two opinions they couldn t but they bought it but they made it and bought it to be a good thing not a bad one no one invented it so that you would so that it d be used as a murder machine they didn t just make it like on the advertisement greatest murder machine ever perfect for murdering your parents we don t know like why he built it maybe it was because of that but you don t know like exactly what his point of the invention was it was to like study the children s thoughts it was to study their minds because the children he said that but what if it s not he s a liar the children were mentally impaired and they needed to be looked up on and they wanted to know what they were thinking so so a psychologist another good quote to show that it was to show that it might have that it could have been the parents fault was that on page 11 it said yeah george said who was it that who was it said children are carpets they should be stepped on occasionally because the parents didn t they didn t do anything to the kids they they didn t really step on them that much until the end they just did what they want they just all of a sudden just like flattened them yeah they just did it so abruptly yeah they just started and let it go it was just like bam you re dead no wonder they wanted them dead guys let s try and talk one person at a time or else we can t hear my turn okay on page 15 it says that the dad went from santa santa to scrooge and like if he would have taken away like one thing at a time over a period of time i don t think the kids would be like like killing them but it says he just took all the good stuff away at once and they got like really mad that s also kind of dangerous though because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter so it was they still could ve gotten mad it s also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away because they get more and more mad all the anger i have another opinion that i was trying to say but then i let fiona go first that s not fair no that s not it s my fault all the anger built up because anyway um,0.0
viewing my art room from the front corner i have a storage area on the right hand side entry to the art room and paint storage is right by the door uh a cart for paint supplies that can be wheeled out into the room i have a large white cabinet for all of my paper and on the other side storage for student art work i have a dry erase board a digital white board and a bulletin board for instruction for students in the front of the room we often sit right in the center of the room there s also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in my tables are shaped around there in a u shaped formation each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling indicating the table there s a red table orange yellow green blue and so forth each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables in the very back corner is the teacher desk two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that s hooked up to the digital whiteboard across the back of the room i have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work and store some ongoing large artworks on the back wall i have more storage metal cabinets rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from and directly below me is our class pet this is where shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating like rabbits and dogs dinosaurs and kitty cats and puppies so first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures listen so that we have time for working i need everyone to put in bubble we are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long long long ago the very oldest art in the whole world are horses and bulls inside of a cave so the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals about horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them put hands down put hands down dinosaurs yeah well that was after the dinosaurs but i m looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here does anyone recognize some of those animals yeah izaiah do you izaiah izaiah with a z do you want to go up and point come up and show us some animals that you recognize only animals who only only listen she s the teacher right now what s it kangaroo what else let her answer fish and turtle and um crocodile and a duck yeah and some kind of a bird good job did you notice that these are all made with dots that s how some artists who live in australia kimberly come right here in front of me turn around so you can see that s how some artists in australia make animals and they kind of show what s inside of them don t they it s really good that you notice that izaiah do you have a comment i know all those animals good so you were naming them right along with her raiden why is your name up your hand up you said last time we have to finish our oh we do have to finish those you re right we will don t worry okay next what kind of animal is that a horse a horse you know what it says at the top it s a horse of a different color because what color is it blue kind of like the wizard of oz right there why boys and girls why is the horse blue what do you think why is the horse blue to make the horse beautiful to make it beautiful why else would it be blue maybe because it there s another one it s a unicorn horse isn t it what shhhh what i m curious izaiah why would an artist make a horse blue because it might be a unicorn well it could be why because it might be a different kind of animal yeah it might be a different type of animal horse have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination and used your favorite colors in it how many people do that sometimes i know i do sometimes i might make an animal but instead of making him brown maybe i ll make him pink and purple and yellow ooooooh and make him a little bit more imaginative sometimes at my dad s house all by myself what else do we have another horse here s a fancy prancy horse now the other horse was kind of looking down but what s this horse doing what s this horse doing jumping flying he s walking or galloping isn t he he looks look how he s standing look at the two horses if you had to tell me how this horse is feeling sad why do we think sad emma why do you think sad because he s looking down he is looking down isn t he maybe he s sad because his family just got killed by another animal oh i hope that didn t happen he could be sad about something that happened what about this horse happy why melanie why do you think he looks happy because he still has a family of his own because why because he still has a family of his own that s not why that s not why izaiah you might have a different idea than melanie isn t it okay to have a different idea yeah so i need you sitting kimberly and regan you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun izaiah so it s okay to have what was your idea about why he might be happy because he s walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals oh my but that wouldn t be very happy would it you think he looks happy are there any other words you can think of to describe him he s prancing around usually if you re in a bad mood do you walk around like this with your head up no i used to do this too that s not prancing that s stomping but prancing is when you have your head up isn t it kimberly kimberly right here come over here by me maybe maybe he was doing this because on his arm there s something on his arm oh it could be like a bandage couldn t it it might just be the way it s painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him is that what you re noticing what are you noticing but one of my family died awww that is sad isn t it really really really old that happens sometimes i m sorry family died in a fire guess what guess what shhhh kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom not crawling on the floor you have to color inside of it you might want to draw his shell first to make it really big look at mine can i see good job make these lines really really dark hey look at my turtle go back over it like this boys and girls if your paper s kind of cause you re pushing so hard then you re drawing dark enough okay they should really be pressing hard with that good go over it really really dark that s dark enough it looks great oh kimberly yes and put your name on the front with the crayon well look izaiah here s two choices for your shell you can start with an oval like that or you can start like this okay yeah but i think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle which one do you like make it really big perfect there you go look at my turtle boys and girls i want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint okay keep darkening your lines okay darken those lines we have to go and get our paint boys and girls darken every line and i m going to come around and as soon as i see that yours is nice and dark i ll put the paint on your table okay this is yours that s good that s good this is dark enough what i want you to trace over is the black parts and see these pencil lines you have to trace over top of them or the paint will cover them up so what color would you like to use there what color would you like to trace these in come pick a color come sit down tyler start working on your design no start working on your designs in the middle that s perfect nice and dark boys and girls see how dark these lines are this is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be you want to go back over it and trace it really dark that one looks good too nice and dark that s awesome start drawing i need yellow boys and girls would you put your name on pardon the interruption please come to the office please come to the office put your name right here while you re getting ready to paint put your name on the front in crayon nice and dark write your name nice and dark with your crayon well trace over it with the crayon look at mine as soon as you re sitting down caitlin i m coming around to look boys and girls when you re ready you may put your hand up and i ll come around and check your pictures you are ready yours looks really nice good he made me draw it for you very good melody i m waiting for that hand to go up isaiah ah that looks great while you re waiting for your paint make those darker shhhh darken these a little bit izaiah what are you doing oh i like your turtle,0.0

seem to hold it forever and it s kind of boring speak really loudly christopher what was your idea we could crescendo we could crescendo i think that s a great idea i think it needs some kind of motion so let s put a little crescendo on the word do ryan what s your question a sforzando we ll try that in a second let s see we ll choose which one we like better let s try just a crescendo on do just to keep it interesting so it s try and do it in one breath if you have to breathe don t breathe at the same time as your neighbor stagger ready here we go i love the crescendo we have to get it

crescendo lovely expression put that one under your chair and take out you re a grand old flag,0.0
what i need you to do is you re going to be looking at both sets of data the one from october in the morning and the one from last week in the afternoon so i want you to work with your shoulder partners okay and the first thing i want you to look at this table you can do all three isabella you can come sit right here you re gonna work with your shoulder partners and i m just gonna take a second and i want you to see what is common what is in common how is the data aligned okay so i want you to work with your shoulder partners want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data okay where are you all standing what is the same between those two days you re looking from this day to this day overall what is the the heat that was trapped inside the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on and the black soaks in the heat so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers it traps it into okay y all figured out about the black look at your other you have three other kind of solar water heaters look there see what other types you can find what did y all find out the black cover covers it okay the black cover it s highest on both sheets on both sheets and what did you say white is the lowest and white uncovered is whites are lower than blacks and white uncovered is the lowest okay okay okay everyone find some similarities okay if you can hear me clap once if you can hear me clap twice okay just one thing don t tell me all the things that you have found the same table four what did you find that was the same in those sets of data elijah only one went down okay which one went down white uncovered okay so you saw that white uncovered went down what s another scientific word for going down everybody decrease okay so white under decrease in both okay what else did you find alex that the rankings were the same for each one okay and when you re talking about the rankings what are you meaning like white uncover had decreased the most uh huh um white covered was was really toward the middle uh huh black uncovered was also was the next one and black covered was the last one in order from the heat okay does everyone agree yes you all see the same thing now what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered what does that mean justin that black absorbed more heat okay that black maybe absorbed the most and what did the white do everybody it reflected it reflected or anthony what were you gonna say absorbed the least absorbed the least because it was reflecting now okay that was the easy part now i want you to look at your graphs and i want you to try to figure out things that are different okay things that are different this is a little tricky okay so you work with your partner try to figure out the things that are different okay okay and how does that relate to the results look at these results and how are these results different okay and so you have a wider range than you do the width okay so what were you saying now that i think that the they are so seperated out the first time we did it than last week okay girls what do y all think i think here it s like up now think about why it would be a lot closer ooh okay okay well let s take he said hotter the morning what was our temperature 24 24 and the afternoon what is so think about what y all talking about okay y all ready to report out okay if you can hear me clap once if you can hear me clap twice okay different give me one thing that was different stephanie they all got different angles okay the lines are different angles you re right what else chloe at 10 30 a m all of them had all of temperatures were higher as well as to the 2 30 p m higher temps in morning okay um what else kristin can you think of something else what do you think nick there s different air temperature okay there s a different air temperature okay what else just looking at the overall graph justin just looking at just the picture of the graph how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon all of the temperatures went got decreased in the in the um at 2 30 okay and when you say decrease which graph looked like this the morning or the afternoon the morning the morning which one looked like this the afternoon okay so overall the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon now why do you think that could be why do you think that could be kristen because it s like on the side oh okay here s our school okay this is where we did our experiment and kristen s saying that the morning time the sun s here okay where was the sun in the afternoon anthony it was like barely okay okay semijah it was in the clouds okay it was sometimes it was going behind the clouds where was it alex where was it in the sky you don t remember behind the school okay behind the school so this was our morning experiment and this was our afternoon experiment okay and did we get different kinds of data because what was truly pretty much the same between both days besides the sun what was the air temperature in the morning 25 25 okay so our air temperature stayed the same but the thing that was different was what where the sun was where the sun was okay so thinking about that we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school okay a solar water heater installed at the school so what other do y all know a solar water heater a hot water heater in your house okay when you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water how do you think that water s heated does anyone know peyton you have the water in your well you have a water heater in your garage or um okay it s in your garage but what s heating that water the sun no,0.0
has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees why do you think it s more light around him i don t know just to show that to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture what is the dark force symbolizing why is it a dark force why isn t it like a bright light yeah i don t know it kind of reminds me of what jack said dante started going through the forest it kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff hell s not a very bright place so it reminds me of that one thing the light and religious paintings jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he s pure or more religious but what d you say i said but dante isn t pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn t as pure as like jesus okay so i want to come your statement in a moment because kailyn had something to offer why do you say he s not pure is there any indication that he s not pure well it s kind of an inference because he s man we all assume that the purity is in god or jesus or buddha or whatever he s not because he s man and men have faults women have faults a human being is just not divine i guess but it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously so he kind of is the most pure one not like godlike but he is more pure than the rest i believe so do you think that s why dante went to hell in the first place to go see all the bad people do you think he was going there to learn a lesson or going there to prove that he was right because remember this is a fictional this is fictional so can a character cause you re right we infer that man is sinful but can a fictional character be perfect can be flawless can be sinless and if so is dante trying to go a different way of inference is he trying to infer that he is from what you ve said that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he s not already so can a fictional character be pure one of the questions i think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent i kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything like a wake up call you re going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways they were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing he was considered a fraud by the other team i guess side so i think it s more of a like he s going to there to see what happens when you don t be the best you could be i guess who judges where you go is it the devil or is it a higher power i thought it was the gods that judged that are there gods in this story do we ever hear much about the gods we aren t sure about the gods yeah really who judges where all these people go cause they re talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that we didn t really read the hell part as opposed to the yeah yeah so maybe in the other books it would explain where the gods are and you said who judges where they go and everything technically we don t know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating brutus cassius and judas but in the book on page 41 lines 8 9 minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go so he s kind of like boss of hell sort of forty one lines eight and nine i have a question are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell that s what i find too meaningful but in their own perspective they are different individual yeah so do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far what do you think depends on how far you go down like the pain increases one of my questions are are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do i think it s what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are i think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes couldn t it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life for instance in limbo all these babies that had died and weren t baptized are now there but they hadn t really hurt anybody so they re not being quite as punished as let s say judas who s in the center of hell having his head gnawed on he caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done so it depends on who they put it on yeah so if they just keep it to themselves like gouging out the eyes that s not really hurting anyone else right where s the gouging of the eyes where did you just pull that from what piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out oh i m sorry i got confused oedipus oedipus he punished himself for it in a weird way but do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn t torture other people think before you respond think about it because i want you to respond to this this is huge i want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we re going to do for the end of the year okay so write down your question mainly she has brought up just like i heard you guys doing with these pictures a different text didn t you bring up the odyssey with this yeah do you want me to write oedipus specifically yep write down the gouging of oedipus eyes where would oedipus have ended up in dante s inferno okay so pretty much yep and i want you guys to answer and then i ll move on and come back i love how you bring in another text that s one reason i brought this picture in so you guys hit on that i love that you brought this up this is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we ve read and you have to develop a theme so right there s a good start okay you ready for them to answer it yeah okay the pain that oedipus caused wasn t intentional so i don t really think he d be punished as harshly i do believe that he d be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and i believe a couple other people during that fight so he would be punished but i don t believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment cause really he didn t knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally so really he shouldn t be punished for something that he didn t know he was doing but he still killed somebody he did kill somebody and the gouging of his eyes i don t think would lessen that i think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him although it did cause him a lot of pain i believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes may i clarify something really quick here so you re saying basically because she asked where in hell would he be so f irst of all what level do you think he d be gouging eyes or not where would he be in hell where would dante run into him he would be with the murderers with the murderers okay so you re saying that he wouldn t be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging no that is just his own retribution yeah he did that to lessen the guilt in his life in himself cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes and also even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with like suicides right cause there s the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell or they destroy their possessions i didn t quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had i don t know maybe a couch or something if you destroyed that you d go to hell because they destroyed their own items right right in circle nine and that s what important about this in circle nine those people that destroyed or take from you know you have canna after cain everything is allegorical every part of circle nine there s an allegory there s ptolemy there s cain everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins because of what they did to humanity like ptolemy murdered people in his in his he was a ruler he just murdered people mass murders so he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin that hitler type of sin so everybody in that level too which would be interesting to see talk about some of our other literature talk about the odyssey a little more i have one more question about sin do you think is everyone s definition of sinning the same actually i don t believe so we were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in limbo goes along with what he said was no i didn t steal so you stole and then you lied yeah so you double dipped so you half and did different things oh interesting so what d you come to we came to they d go to the serious one yeah whichever one s more serious why basically the one thing that impacted the world more like in a bad way is going to take the worse punishment so if i stole a penny or i lied to the king i d probably get punished for lying to the king that s what we kind of came up with yeah so i want to ask you a question if you re saying you lied and then you lie about lying or you steal and you lie about lying i don t steal sorry yeah they re two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes okay so does that play into that would you suffer twice the punishment then no it doesn t bring up any of that in dante s basically everybody s got the same punishment but still wouldn t you get like harsher well depending on the circle yeah but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people will you give me an example well let s see ulysses and i forget the other guy s name they are in the same flame and i think he said the flame was burning brighter i would assume that d be a worse punishment than other people if they re burning if they re burning yeah some of the less worse um lesser punishments it s like magicians get their heads turned backwards you could see where you ve been but you wouldn t cry over it unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again yeah then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again yeah yeah i want to ask you guys a question because we ve studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying oedipus and i don t know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together but there is what is her name antigone s brother s name that was dead polynices yeah polynices was it the one where she was like leaning over his body yeah by the rock yeah okay now that you ve read the inferno do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur i can relate okay talk to me about that because it reminds me of dante being lost in the forest in the beginning and then it reminds me of how oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn t see anything and so he didn t know which path to take he had to rely on somebody else he had to rely on virgil to get him through what was to come then oedipus he had to rely on antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically nice nice that s what i got well as i walk away i want you guys cause i m going to leave this here i want you guys to talk about other literature cause you said yes i can relate some you just did i would like for you to relate all right okay okay,0.0
let s go okay continue yes all right scholars here s my question what do you think actually let me start by quoting the passage so it says they can either trust or predict what chacko s attitude would be and they were trying to hide that get rid of it all before chacko returned so what do you think chacko s opinion of all of this chaos would be could you just be particular with the chaos you were talking about what s that the entire situation the steamy love affair and the reaction on baby kochamma s part and mammachi s part got it i don t think he d be happy about the love affair cause as it says it s like she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one blessed personally by the patriarch of antioch antioch an imperial entomologist and rhodes scholar from oxford so it s like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long and just thrown it out the window i m gonna have to disagree with that becca i mean i think that chacko is a liberal type he is very progressive he s a marxist he didn t allow his father to beat his mother as most indians traditionalists probably would be ok with i think that chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if some guy was having an affair with his sister as a social ideal i think he would be fine with everything i agree because i feel like oh god i had this whole plan of something to say and i can t remember sorry no it s not your fault well what is the only thing that made chacko upset at mammachi was it that she abandoned her children oh i got it yeah i feel like the most of this passage though it s third person narration it really feels like it s coming out of baby kochamma s mouth and it s like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff the whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black to quote the passage once again so i feel like that all really baby kochamma s words and not necessarily baba s beliefs and i feel like they have really contrasted beliefs yeah i mean i feel like all the diction you were talking about for instance when it says mammachi s rage at the old one eyed paravan standing in the rain drunk dribbling and covered in mud and it repeats mud a lot and i think it s that s just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they re trying and almost like mud covers things up so it s almost like it should be covered up and they were trying to cover it up but don t you feel like they used chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do oh he s coming back so we have to do this they kind of use him as the excuse to do it well it s sort of like chacko could intervene and so we have to do it now so we can t miss our chance to do it again i think that s important actually i think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here it wasn t their fault when the whole thing spun like a deranged top i think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie in the movie for example when mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if kayani gets married but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around i think that s this book and movie is really trying to say is this is what happens when you set up rules and don t adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change i ll just go in the fourth paragraph they talk about having a plan it s very orderly and they said that kochu maria was a midget lieutenant they had this very organized and planned out even though in the second paragraph she shuddered with a school girl shudder it s like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff yeah on that i really want to say cause it says school girl shudder at the beginning and then it back in the fourth paragraph when it s talking about their plan they re referred to as the two old ladies so that s contrasting in a way to be described which obviously it s important yeah i think that s one of the themes of the passage conflicts between age and which one is ultimately i don t want to say better but a better advantage i guess like in authority between age and youth you mean between old and young yeah age and youth which one can have a better life according to them they also play with age when they locked ammu up it s kind of like putting her in time out like they tricked her in to her room which is also a parallel i saw in the movie when they locked kalyani up so she couldn t get married it was to keep them from doing stuff i just want to bring up another theme of the passage where it s the very beginning where it s before we are completely ruined by the it kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs what you do in this society at least affects everybody around you and it kind of contrasts ammu s individualism with what societal hierarchy and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy so they have authority over her and so they re telling her not to do this and they re presenting their authority over her and chacko s even higher than them just cause he s a guy when the passage lists the life cycle events the weddings the funerals baptisms and birthday parties it says for generations to come so i feel like what peter was saying it affects all of society that also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people the funerals are when you die the baptisms are when you are just born so it s saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life that s how profound it is and even that sentence that peter was talking about before it goes any further before we are completely ruined i think that s also just family selfishness because they re just projecting what her the consequences of her actions will be for them not necessarily for her and in the movie where the leader of that house of she s just really concerned about herself she ll sacrifice all of the other women just so she s comfortable but does she also use a we i think both baby kochamma and diti say the same thing we re gonna be ruined by this we we we in regards to that i think in water you know how all the widows they sorta put them together and they sort of create this unity it s all out of despair because they all lost something in a sense mammachi lost her former love and so did ammu ammu had babies without it wasn t a formal tradition the way she had her babies and so in a sense she has she s in grievance and so those two aspects unites these women yeah they re all widows yeah they re all widows and that really but does that give them right to be oh understand that s why i feel like it says we not we like our family but more of like we women who are widowed austin what do you think do you think that gives them the right to because they ve also lost and because baby kochamma and mammachi has also experienced trauma so that also means diti as well her husband died when she was young does that give them the right to take that i don t think so cause that was actually one of my questions especially when it says her tolerance immense needs as far as her son was concerned became the fuel for unimaginable fury at her daughter and then just my question was is baby kochamma s actions motivated by indian society or her own emotions so i don t think that they should be able to from their past experience take it out on everybody else i think that what we re talking about right now maybe be reason that ghandi appears at the end of the film because ghandi as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism and it s when he shows up nice diti sees that may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain ghandi s existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women i think that ghandi in the movie represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once ghandi takes power the widows will gain power the untouchables won t be untouchable anymore they ll gain more rights so i think they look at him as not really rationalism because some people think that he s just crazy the brahmin caste don t see him as rational so i think it s more of a hope in an idealized society building off of what she said how ghandi represents re birth i think coincides with the movie s title water for me at least the way i saw it i felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie they washed themselves it was washing away their sins being reborn i thought who s the girl the one who killed herself kalyani i thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself because the way she was killing herself she was submersing herself in water and i thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff she in a sense she was clearing away her sins and so she would go to the next life sinless i think that the drowning of kalyani parallels to how sophie mol drowned how it s like the innocent life was taken by the water which isn t really innocence too but was kalyani innocent i think that if she hadn t been forced to do things she would have been she didn t feel right about what she had done i m gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way in both the movie and the book it says the fisherman had already found sophie mol she they drowned trying to cross the river and kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who norian really is the river is important in both works it s an inescapable wall so i don t think water is portrayed as a good image i mean it could possibly be both i think peter made a pretty good point about it sam did with kalyani s death and sophie mol s death but i think it could be both i think it s a duality thing and then going on combining what both ya ll said where you said it s an inescapably and the way they view it as washing away their sins view it as a cleansing thing also for example emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs and they re cleaning themself in this if water is just viewed a symbol they re cleaning themselves with something that s bad i also don t think that they depend on the water too to get their food from it they wash themselves in it yet it s also it creates this it s something that the paravans are trying to overcome a lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier but they depend on it they still need it so it s contrasting what they believe just like a duality thing yeah it s the family and god s talkings their immediate family they depend on each other because when you re a child you have to have an older figure to help you grow up but they are also they cause the turmoil with each other they create their own problems pretty much it s like you can t live with them but you can t live without them susan did you have a question yes i did well a lot of them are about similarities between characters but one thing that i thought about was how norian dealt with his lover s loss and how velutha was able to deal with being separated from ammu and do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations sorry i missed all this so she i heard well norian because he was a brahmin the highest caste i think he said we ll either going to calcutta or india to start his life you mean kolkata or i m sorry or england to become a lawyer so he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education and he could provide for himself velutha was an untouchable so he had no opportunity,0.0
tilted towards the sun you re closer to the sun which is heat which means you re going to be warmer when you re tilted away from the sun then there s less heat because you re farther away from it it s going to be colder that s what changes the seasons once again it goes in orbit like you said the closer we are to the sun or the father away once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit i think that tilt causes the seasons and the closer we are tilted to the sun that means it s like summer or spring then if we re tilted back it s winter or fall i m kind of understanding what you guys are saying because i m thinking of it as like say like the globe that s sitting right there say that ben was the sun you can use that if you d like say that ben was the sun the sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe because the globe s tilted so there wouldn t be much sun at the top of the sphere because that s the most tilted away from the sun so it would cause summer lower and on the other side it would cause winter why are you shaking your head i disagree i think the sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom because like antarctica and stuff always cold and it s at the bottom so i think it hits more in the top and in between like by the equator because as you go down south it s more warmer but still if you go down way down to antarctica it s totally freezing they don t get no sun that s not right because there is like sunlight in antarctica and stuff it s just cause like the latitude and longitude and like because because antarctica s at zero degrees so it s cold down there i want to know when the sun is going in its orbit if it just goes from this to this like boom or if its turning and its like facing the sun like that like i don t understand that okay so our question is what like when you re going around the sun and its on its axis like this tilted and it goes around eventu does it just like go like that like real quick and then it s like shifted so the bottom is getting more light and that would put us in winter what do you think kaylie you haven t said anything do you think that our our tilt s going to just change no i think it s like whenever we re rotating like it goes around the sun in the orbit can i show she s saying that as it s rotating it s staying the same it s just that it s changing because you re changing position from which way the sun is can i show an example with the globe yeah please say the sun was in the middle say like the globe is right here say we re right here it s summertime really close and the sun s right here and as we go around like maybe like we re right here and this is fall and then we go to winter and as we turn this way for the spring and then we re back to summer again because we re going around the sun so but the only problem with that is we re still going to be tilted away when it when we go over towards the sun we re still going to be tilted away won t we well the earth s always tilted yeah but we ll be tilted away in the summer you re tilted towards the sun let s go back to does the tilt change okay so we re definitely talking about this tilt and i m guessing there s a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt yes so if you think you understand the tilt help everybody else understand we re not getting this tilt in what you re talking about so explain it the best way you can and help each other okay so i don t get this tilt does it just flip flop what do you think anna i think it stays the same what about you shana you haven t said anything yet well as the earth goes around in its orbit it shifts just like a little bit that way you re like closer to the sun and then during the winter we re father away is that how it is we re closer towards the sun in the summer and we re father away in the winter yes who doesn t think that could i try something with the globe real quick yes could i borrow nick to be my sun yeah be his sun nick come on sun go out there and stand in the middle pretty dark sun yeah you are okay we re gonna say that this little pin here is where the sun is hitting today all right and we re spinning woah spinning that way it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning but it never it never tilts back towards the sun that s what i don t understand does it just go like this this is a really good question this is a really good question now i want wait don t move yet i want go ahead be the sun still and i want you to walk around and explain to people what you re talking about number one show us the tilt okay that s the tilt show everybody the tilt okay everyone this nick move you re in the way of people just duck down just crouch and this is the way of the tilt the way it s tilted that way but as we go around it s still tilted that way and this side here is still far away so what it s going to stay winter all the time or is it just going to like flip and be like hey guys look now we re summer but we re upside down that s what i don t understand he has a very good question okay his question is why is what hemisphere are you talking about the northern hemisphere okay so why is the northern hemisphere always tilted towards the sun how he s walking away because his argument is that oh i have it right here go ahead it says because the earth s axis is slightly tilted when the north pole is laying towards the sun and south pole is laying away from the sun and when the south pole is leading towards the sun the north pole is leading away from the sun it says as a result the number of daylight hours in the northern and southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator the hemisphere that leads towards the sun has a long day and short nights does that have to do with anything see i wait does that have to do with anything that s sabrina s question does that have to do with anything so summarize what you just read to us does the tilt have like also have to do with like the days and like the short days and short nights does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights and long days and short nights shawn you re shaking your head yes you think it does have to do with it say yes yes you think it does have to do with it why who could help him explain why would a tilt change the length of day move over lucas because like it s if like it ll be indirect sun if it s tilted away from it and instead of like i don t know i think it is because i think another thing in the direct rays because the way we re tilted it s the number of daylight hours because of the less sun as much of the sun because of the tilt and how the sun hits it when its on its tilt i think like see how it tilted that way no why don t you use it why don t you boys sit down and let pass that globe over to byers and let him explain what i think is you know how it s tilted this way maybe it ll tilt the opposite direction for the summer like instead of it being tilted towards this it ll tilt the other way for the south instead of the north be showing the south would be showing that s what i think where is the sun that s what i m not understanding the sun would usually be in the middle you need a hand yeah okay go ahead be the sun again the sun s in the middle and that s why if it s tilted this way we re getting our sun but i thought if it would tilt the opposite way like instead of being tilted this way it d tilt that way then the south would get more sun okay so how but what you re asking is the same question as lucas yeah how does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the sun that s what you re trying to figure out whenever lucas walked it around the whole time what hemisphere was pointing towards the sun the southern hemisphere was pointing towards the sun and the northern hemisphere was pointing away from the sun ben no i thought it was the northern was pointing to the sun and the southern was pointing the other way but it remained constant the whole orbit yes that s what i couldn t figure out like how did it just like did it like flip around and all of the sudden maybe the sun it changed what do you guys think does the sun move jj you haven t been in here yet i think like every day it moves a little to the other side wait what does the earth the earth moves everyday yeah it might like it tilts every day it tilts the tilt is changing is that what you re saying so the tilt changes what were you gonna say i think the it the earth like doesn t move like when it stays in one spot i think it might like flip like kind of like just go around like can you show us do you wanna show us sure i ll try i was gonna say maybe like as it s as like the earth turns around maybe it like tilts forward every so often and backward so you re telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips yes okay so what are you saying it just goes around like this and eventually it just like spins around so it spins on top of its rotation yeah what do you think brad i think yeah i kind of agree with him wait with who with david while it s like going around its orbit it just like tilts so the tilt is changing yeah what do you think alec you haven t said anything yet i don t agree with him i think that it spins while its moving around don t raise your hand you don t have to raise your hand only this like what nick just did or maybe every day it goes a little bit and tilts like this and the sun hits more of the southern it s like everyday goes a little bit little bit little bit so where the south starts to get more sun because like when we re in summer and australia has winter so when we re in winter australia has summer so and it s in the southern half and we re in the northern half wait tiffany you were shaking your head do you agree with what he s saying sort of yeah because if one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight the most likely it s gonna be warmer than the other like he was saying when we get more sunlight and the temperature s warm up here the temperatures in the southern hemisphere get a little colder if they don t have as much sunlight and not as much warmth you see what i mean like say i m right here the sun is tilted so you see how the sun s right here and then it tilts a little bit like this we re still getting summer sunlight but australia s getting more sunlight i have to agree with what jj said earlier it tilts everyday so the tilt is changing you think that the tilt is changing morgan you think the tilt is changing no i don t think it s changing i think it s staying the same because even i think the rotation helps because if it goes around the orbit even though its rotating it helps like nick you re the sun like and the axis stays and when it rotates the earth rotates and it s like kind of it like helps us i don t know like indirect sunlight i don t know something like that i can show what she means i think go ahead i think it s also about the gravitational pull like when it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull as it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull okay when you do this grace please explain to me what it is so that everybody here that s watching can try and make sense of what we re talking about i think what she s saying is like say nick s the sun again since the northern is that way i think she s saying is it doesn t rotate but this is but we re kind of going around kind of like this so then it changes so now the southern is towards the sun and the northern is that way so now it s changed she did something very different in her orbit did anybody catch that yeah yeah like she it didn t move it just went around like around the sun what do you mean it didn t move the earth stayed still and just moved at one point it didn t do that okay let s do it again okay and i want you to make sure that number one everybody sees where you start and everybody sees what happens to the earth as she s showing you how it s going around so explain to us what is this where are we starting okay we re starting out this way with the northern towards the sun and the southern away from the sun and as we are rotating i don t know if all of you guys can see this but as we re going around stop there it s not moving so since it s not moving now the northern is kind of like facing away and the southern is facing towards the sun now keep going and then just make sure that the camera can see what you re talking about as you go around okay so did everybody see that who doesn t understand that who didn t understand what she did right there okay so now i don t understand actually wouldn t it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis and then start rotating again i m not sure what you mean by that like you spun it like this all right but the earth is going like this the whole time would that end up stopping and then it go like this or is that still happening it s not turning like that it s just rotating around the sun wait sabrina you had something to say okay so here s what s happening lucas is a little confused about your explanation okay so we just have to go through it again what did you have to say sabrina the earth doesn t change its tilt it stays like an exact same position but when it goes around the sun it gets like different ways like the sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers okay wait why don t you try to show him maybe it s just a different person maybe it will help explain it okay so the more people we can get information out of remember the more we re gonna understand so start and tell us what s happening and just make sure the camera can see what you re doing the northern hemisphere is towards the sun and the southern is facing away so this causes colder weather and up here where it s facing the sun causes warmer weather so when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here the southern is facing towards wait is the southern facing towards the southern s facing towards the sun and the winter is facing away which causes it to be warmer down here and winter up here who can help her out because what i don t understand is go ahead go ahead i don t understand it because it s still changing from day to night but then it s shifting so wouldn t it have to stop spinning and then shift if it stops spinning we re gonna die not necessarily okay wait ben start from the beginning and explain what s going on nick is our sun still put your legs in so he doesn t trip northern hemisphere is towards the sun southern s away and it s still spinning it doesn t change okay and so stop there and what s happening the southern hemisphere s towards the sun and the northern s away from it and what happened to the tilt the whole time it didn t change it what it didn t change it didn t change it stayed the same but that made more sense like i couldn t figure out why it wasn t spinning but now i do and then it keeps going and then it just goes back now i understand okay let s use this model and try to figure out where are the seasons happening so where do we live anna we live yeah where he s pointing what s that called somebody america north america north america let s get bigger northern hemisphere what byers the northern hemisphere okay so we live in the northern hemisphere right now what s happening it s summer it s summer in the northern hemisphere does everyone see that yes yes anybody not see it s summer in the northern hemisphere see it yeah okay so,0.0
5 03 5 03 all right let s talk for a minute before you continue with your little test first of all let s talk about motion what do you know about motion motion is the way that you get from one place to another it s changing position changing position so just now bailey was running was he changing position yes yes all right so how do we know that he was in motion like when he is running toward me how do i know he s in motion that stays there and you can see him coming up nobody else was moving around so that s our frame of reference he came over there so we know he s coming toward us all right so you guys did a trial how many times did you run bailey three all right so what are we gonna do now we re gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three why are we dividing by three because we did it three times okay you did it three times you re finding your average what s another word for average mean mean good all right so let s find his mean or his average and then we ll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number okay what did you get 5 21 5 21 is that what everybody has nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that let s name some things that are in motion what do you know that s in motion the earth the earth is in motion yup but i don t feel the earth move so how do i know it s in motion cause sun is the frame of reference okay so if i was thinking of the sun which is what they do and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference what else do you know that moves animals animals insects cars insects cars boats people people books boats boats all right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what s something else that i need to know besides how long it took him the distance the distance traveled which is a hundred feet so what difference did we do hundred feet a hundred feet okay so what s the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet yes you did that and chalk marked it good all right so let s we re talking about the average time taken all right so let s do that now 19 so let s talk about what that means 19 19 feet per second what s that mean feet per second 19 feet per second so if i say feet per second can you explain that to me what does that mean 19 feet per second every second i would go 19 19 feet good okay so if i m driving in my car and my car s going 70 miles per hour and i m on the interstate do i say my car s going 75 no no you d say miles per hour bleh 70 miles per hour can you tell me nathan why what does that mean 70 miles per hour 70 miles per hour means you re going 70 miles per each hour for every hour so that s good to know for vacations right especially when you have little kids who are saying are we there yet you gotta figure out how long it s gonna take you are we there yet right okay all right you re going to go into your next part and i ll be right back to check on you who s the next person jordan it s gonna be jordan all right miss jordan hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up he thinks he needs one more piece of tape ready ready set go 1 76 1 89 okay so why don t you write them both do you have two spots only have one you have two spots write one there and one there that s what you do there just like that what did you get 1 89 1 89 all right let s come talk about what you re doing so let s get the three kinds of balloons that you re testing just gonna bring over here dan why don t you get the um come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one we might try that one here so we have a big round one a big round one a green one okay a long one okay and a birthday one did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions different different predictions what do you think the happy birthday one you think the happy birthday one long long long long can you tell me why you think happy birthday and then you ll tell me why you think long at first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it but now there s wind blowing it blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster it d be like this wind yes you had this big that is a pretty good prediction why do you guys think it s gonna be the long one i think it s the long one because it s more smaller and the air can come off faster and it s more stretchier stretchier tight it s more tight all right all right we had some wasn t going all the way so we changed it to 20 it would stop about maybe three feet away from the end it would stop so what did you decide to do we changed it to 20 you moved it to 20 okay so what else could you have done besides move it to 20 blow up the balloon more maybe blow up the balloon more maybe the little one wouldn t have worked though huh it s not that much in there we tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped the little one i think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far all right so all right so let s come back this way watch out behind you megan dan you can go over to there s motion in the wind huh 176 and 108 all right so here we go what are you gonna do first let s do the round balloon first that was nobody s prediction right nope so let s do that one first what are we gonna do 20 add both up and then what are you gonna do divide by two why are we dividing by two to get the average to get the average why did you do it twice why didn t you just and there s two the two trials why you did two trials why wouldn t you just do one why do you think that would ve been better to do two divided by then we wouldn t have to divide it we wouldn t have to find the average at all but i guess we d get a better result what d you get there 2 35 3 73 that s what i got 2 35 you add these two together and you divide them remember this is the average can you have four i divided by two but i got 3 73 let s try again on the calculator i always do things twice to double check 2 35 2 35 everybody s good okay so let s go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed so what s our formula for that how do we figure out average speed you do 20 because of the okay so that s when we took 20 because you see we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30 so let s cross out you changed it to 20 and i think it was dan that said if we were to probably no hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon but changing the feet that ll work now how fast did the first balloon go 19 35 by 20 look at your formula again 8 52 your distance is 20 so you re gonna do your distance divided by your average time good 8 51 okay and i ll come back to check on you you all right let s see how these guys are doing this one s a runner the line s over here right jordan 16 16 we re at the end of nathan s so let s go ahead and figure out nathan together i ll come sit in your spot they re in here so to figure out nathan let s talk about it together while we re doing it we need some more calculators over here wait what s this 641 everybody please do catch up got your pencils wait wait 641 575 tell me again what we re doing average time 6 08 does everybody have six read it back correctly six point o eight is that how you read it correctly in math six decimal do we say decimal six six point zero eight do we say point six and and eight hundredths six and eight hundredths ohhhh gotta get it so let s look just at our average time for just a second stop for a minute and let s look at the top at our average time how do we know who is going the fastest when we re look at just the top part just the time average time the lowest the lowest number right cause he s getting in the fastest time so now when we go to the bottom and we re figuring out the speed how do we do speed whoever s the lowest number the highest number the highest number it s going to be let s go ahead and do nathan and then we ll compare then we ll let demi do hers 16 point 16 point 16 44 right yep so let s look so far at the bottom bailey jordan and nathan who is the fastest so far bailey so far bailey okay so how can we instead of looking at this this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me what can i do visually just to make it a little bit clearer make a bar graph okay we can make a bar graph with this anything else we can do line graph maybe get each person to make a line graph take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times because that would be you right over time that would be a great idea so we can do the straight line graphs that s a good idea with the line graph bailey so when we make a line graph we ll do that at the end using this information and then we ll do a bar graph using this information does that sound good all right demi s turn s up let s go let s see how we are doing here okay we re at the very end so which one ended up being the fastest the long one the long one but i think that devon had a very good prediction i think his reasoning was good see that wind blowing in a race when you re in a race and you re running or when you re in a foot ball team what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you re trying to get that ball to the other side you want the wind to be with you right because if you re against the wind the wind is pushing on you so i think devon had an excellent good job devon next time all right we re at the bottom why do you think that balloon was the fastest i put the shape of it the wind went right past it all right remember there was unbalanced force so the force inside the balloon where was the force the wind the air the air that devon blew inside that balloon the air inside pushed the balloon and that s what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go it probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it s on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes that s a pretty good idea too it s kind of like when you re driving a car if you re on vacation sometimes your parents you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler why do you think they would do that because the wind blocks the because the wind is blocking 18 wheel blocks it the 18 wheeler s blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour i mean you can get better gas mileage doing that if you ever see your parents doing that some people don t like to do that though because of rocks rocks yeah it could be dangerous yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks good job,0.0
counting on that i agree with aj but also i think that what i want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what aj was saying it s good to have a backup just in case you want it and we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there so we know that so we re having other people work with it but the problem is is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that what if they messed up what if they blow up or do something wrong and if they re not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there s gonna be a lot more problems and if it s not able to do the same things that s going to be completely bad too okay eric said go up to fix things what would be some things that we would need to make sure that we re going up to maintain in space just to kind of follow up international space station okay international space station some of the satellites we have in orbit okay satellites that do what for us television and communication okay ms mccall what s that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares you can just write sun probe sun probe that s fine excuse me while i turn this on and the hubble hubble s gone a lot longer than they expected it to so if it breaks we d want to repair it especially since we don t have a new one alana i know how mer was talking about the risks like with the challenger and that was really devastating but i remember the wife whose husband died on challenger she said that he knew the risks that s part of being an astronaut and being in nasa and willing to go up there and you re risking your life it s not like they went in there totally blind about that i think that s kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now we have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that i say go for it okay blanca and then megan i get what she s saying with they risked their lives but you re also risking the money and time that everyone has put into it they spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space and like the challenger it just exploded and they didn t even really get that far just for one minor error and i don t think they should cut all the way like they were saying have it just when you need it but it s still a lot of money that our country doesn t really have right now so maybe it s not the most important thing and there s other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that we ll go megan then bieber so you know how we re paying russia to fly up to the international space station i think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station because then we have more funding for nasa and then we have a shuttle then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to russia to fly up there i feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up not for free but we can fly up with the united states and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in they can pay us for it and then we get the money okay bieber you need to sit close eli then we ll go rachel i don t know what color to show but russia s not making a profit off of us riding up there they re just trying to cover their costs it s not like we ll be doing good business ferrying people to the international space station it s not like a tourist attraction or anything it s pretty bland up there russia s just trying to pay to get us up there that s the cost of flying somebody there they re not making profit out of it okay good that s a downpoint rachel i agree with what eli said and also people were talking earlier about jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs and i think i read somewhere that they created 25 000 jobs or something like that but if you think about it if there s 300 million people that s still less than 1 of the population so while it seems like a big number it s still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else especially with the economy so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on nasa on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on nasa and spending billions of dollars amber then clark i was going to say i kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now at this point in time so i don t think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that s also putting a lot of people out of work clark the statistics with the jobs created are probably from when nasa was being used a lot and now that it s been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut and i don t think in this economy people need jobs requiring that much education not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that people just need regular jobs in general so you re saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe and like in science and stuff and not everybody has that that s a downpoint luis going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things i found out that the funding for nasa only accounts for 0 7 of the us government spending i feel like if you just cut all of that that s not really going to make a huge difference when the government s spending 99 3 on other things we ll go hallie then troy going back to the risk of sending people out into space i researched and i found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened as we re pushing for more people and more money we re actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back the risk is just becoming more and more that s an interesting point as we re slowly cutting back on the budgets already we re automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts troy i actually support them cutting the budget because for one when they cut budget they re setting aside money to buy more space exploration from private companies those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government which also stimulates the economy a lot more i mean if everybody s employed by the government like what could happen to greece okay shannon hasn t spoken bieber kind of off of what holly said with the risk and everything going up i did a little research and with nasa there was only a 4 1 fatality rate out of something like 439 astronauts there have only been 18 deaths i feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut okay so even with the budget cuts we re not seeing this huge increase jillian a lot of people are making the points that it s only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles but at the same time i don t think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide put off by one shuttle launch it s 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it s killing the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone not just the people in the space shuttle so you re taking the environmental aspect besides looking at costs besides looking at jobs there s this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide what is the issue associated with carbon dioxide jillian the ozone layer depleted and global warming thank you global warming tyler to go along with what luis said they only get 0 7 of the national spending but we also have gained more knowledge from nasa than any other government thing we can discover maybe how earth is going to end and we can discover things that are more important than other government government spending so you re kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending we ll go eli then justin also luis said it doesn t account for very much of the us budget and if we cut that spending it s really not going to go to anything more productive maybe more guns or something it s not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people it s just going to go to corporations and wars and then in regards to co2 emissions does anyone know how much co2 emissions a moose puts out in a year far more than a truck driver cows and moose i think they can flirt over that i think that s just moose so you re making the comparison to say the idea that even though it s a human made craft if we look at natural sources of the co2 emission and the relative frequency that a moose passes gas a space shuttle launch doesn t have that big of an effect on the environment touche anyone have a cup that hasn t spoken yet that wants to jump in real quick justin going off of what tyler said if we stop funding nasa then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of earth just doesn t allow us to see that far so it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future interesting point amber then eric besides everything about the jobs nasa has created a lot of things that have helped us today different technologies like in someone s presentation they were saying something about they re creating lighter systems for firefighters and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff so there s a lot of technology that s been created because of nasa so i think it s benefited us a lot more than it hasn t helped us and so you re saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives it s not just useful for exploring many new things i forgot my order was it eric on that one i have a couple different connections one of them s with the cost like they re saying it s 0 7 of the total budget but the thing is not only is it that low of a cost it s 14 billion just to give you an actual number it s 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of nasa this year just for this year alone to give you a comparison it s around 640 between 680 for the military budget that is 47 times more expensive now you can say well alright that s the military the thing is that first of all it has a lot higher mortality rate second of all it s a lot less productive in general i mean we re pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet i m sorry but that s not very cool in general for one of those things we re trying to get a high fatality rate not for our side but the other side but the other thing is that for jobs creations if you want to create more jobs and you re going for a more positive feel you wouldn t decrease funding for nasa you would increase funding because think about it if you increased it 47 times to the military i m pretty sure you d get a lot more than one million even a lot lot more than just one million jobs from nasa if you increased this funding a lot because imagine whole new planets just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet and with seven billion people we can t hold that many people very long on this planet but there are so many other planets out there that we could easily fit everyone there s enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet that s how many planets there are so you re thinking planning for the future that it might be beneficial for us holly as i was researching i found out that there s really no short term benefits and we re not guaranteed long term benefits yes we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us we re not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from magnetic storms there might be some way we can save ourselves but we re not guaranteed that so you re saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into the factor we can keep researching but we may never find the answer monique you got some info yeah i think when hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks we ve talked about what was up there the benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section we gain knowledge we need to study the sun probe and hubble and international space station with jobs it provides a whole section of jobs having shuttles go up to space not only that but they ve created new inventions through that and i think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital going from there there s going to be more not just stopping now so again tying in the cost benefit analysis that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs a j and then we ll go alana i guess to counter what troy said and what a few people have said when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money it s not just about the economy when you think about it nasa wasn t meant to help the economy at all and it wasn t meant for job creation even though it has employed so many people through the research that i did there was a story from somebody that s going to be retiring just because he knows he d lose his job anyway he said that after 30 years this is all i know we re losing the most brilliant minds our country has because they just don t know what else to do nasa s been open for decades and that s their job technicians and analysts they re not going to just become accountants or something there s nothing after nasa that s probably the highest most prestigious thing what do you do after that it s not like they re just going to fill minimum wage jobs which is what most people are looking for right now anyway if you re thinking about job creation it s a good point you have all these highly educated specialized people as a j points out where are they going to go are they going to be able to find jobs within our country are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries it s a good point alana then troy i know we re talking a lot about the cost benefit and job creation but i want to go back to the safety and i have a question for everyone just to think about the main part in all the failed missions especially with the shuttle and the challenger it s basically been human error you know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn t listen that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and everything but i ve been thinking what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human and the possible errors that we make like robots we use robots to build half our cars and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate so do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make that s an interesting point we ll have to put that on the question board troy what you got kind of to counter what a j said these people are highly educated minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now people that have highly specialized degrees they re really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees if you can do quantitative physics those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who s just a finance agent so your counterpoint is the idea that because they re so highly educated they will find some sort of a niche yeah there s a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better interesting jillian back to what alana said if you re using robots to make it safer that s also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots if you re using robots as the engineers then you re having people lose jobs interesting point so kind of a counterpoint to shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics there s some drawback association we ll go rachel going back to what eric said a while ago he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget but i feel like the military helps a lot of people and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people because the military pays for a lot of people s education university and stuff i know a lot of people now since university is so expensive a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for so i feel like it should have a higher budget because it s creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren t necessarily has a doctorate in physics or something people that are really smart like what troy said they won t really have that much of a problem finding jobs especially with a big corporation they don t have to necessarily work for the government or nasa or something so i think that the budget should stay where it is because that s pretty funny we ll go megan and tyler i don t know when it was mentioned but we were talking about how we re trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed and i feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now we re trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that s gone i feel like that s really important for the development of earth is to know what it s going to be like when there is no more what can we do so that we don t turn into a mars or venus what can we do now to stop it from happening good so you re making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there s an issue with our magnetosphere potentially could we wind up like mars so kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed future wise so almost like a selfish need to figure out what s going on out there and where we might go anyone that hasn t spoken yet want to comment,0.0
well i can start i just kind of wanted to follow with lina s going back to the very beginning of the book and sort of i guess a response to mariana s comment i think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish so it s not about making this huge change in one moment cause that s never going to happen it s about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step and since we are young adults you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives before you know it things are gonna change so even though it seems discouraging like oh it s really hard and upsetting and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting it s about continuing on and taking those little steps yeah you know at the same time i think there s something hard about it but it s not something that is beyond our control it s just we don t want to appear confrontational because i thought we were having this discussion on friday i was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying and was listening if there were any instances although it doesn t count as racism you count it as prejudice by definition i was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom s boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her and he said oh i wish you were white he wouldn t do that stuff if you were white this was a black girl there was this other in my physiology class isn t that not racism well that s not do you think she was serious or don t you i don t know but you know even if it s joking it s still a pretty serious thing to say and besides there was a mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends some relative saying get a bean or a shnean but you know even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where i could have said well no that s not an appropriate thing to say that could be offensive to people but you know i didn t just because i didn t want to be confrontational so obviously that s some fault of my own for not getting involved there going off of what tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever i m wondering if you re considered actively racist if those jokes don t bother you like i hear that all the time in my third block class and it doesn t bother me it s kind of funny sometimes because a lot of the time it s not interracial it s the same race you know what i m trying to say there s no armenians but i can t roast another armenian should i throw this this is not gonna work laser it bro maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it i think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of show how comfortable we all are with other races and i make fun of my parents i make fun of my teachers because i m comfortable with them maybe we should talk about that and i mean i can do it because we love each other and it s okay it s unconditional so even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other i m scared so going back to what lina was saying at the beginning and what tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing i felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma she makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today and not to say that it s not a giant problem but i feel like one can be passively anti racist whilst working actively towards anti poverty anti hunger anti war and making a difference in the world whether it s in the field of racism or not and then going back to what tomas said about the and i lost my point what was it it ll come back to me who wants to go i think tatum would agree with you and she would even i think say that while you re actively combating say poverty you are having a positive impact for say poor african american families and she points out the correlation statistically speaking between ethnicity and class but one thing i want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that i think that one thing that it means to become an adult and i m thinking what holly said is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants and i think it s really as simple as that what tatum is asking of people that she s asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you i want to hear from other people i got my point for tomas it s coming back it came back to me i had two points when i asked for the yarn then i forgot one of them and i just remembered it i want to encourage other people to speak up too and we ve got 10 minutes left there s a lot of voices that haven t been heard yet today what i m gonna do is something that i m gonna encourage other people to do too i m gonna toss it to somebody who s not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard i ll keep it short and then i ll throw it to someone okay toss it to somebody who doesn t have their hand raised though so back to what tomas said about the confrontational thing is it s really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing and it s the fear of the reaction of either one of those that i think stops most people from speaking up like either confrontation or you re appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more so samuel yeah sure well i was gonna say out of what chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually i think while sometimes it contributes to racism and i have a problem with telling too many off color jokes and gender related jokes but i think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff so if you look at people like comedians say like dave chappelle how many can say that he s a racist person because he makes lots of race based jokes in his comedy on the contrary i think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out when tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there s no such thing as being passively anti racist i think what she means by that is like it s sort of hard i actually got to mention you know our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is unweighted or whatever it s kinda difficult to how should i say it i don t know what i was trying to say i can t put it out into words but anyways i kinda agree and disagree with her it s like you can do little things to change however what i was trying to say is that it s a lot out there and it may be difficult that was all i was trying to say i don t even know here you go what i would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we re addressing it sorta kinda in a way but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society and then for some people that say it that aren t actually trying to make a difference it s like i mean it s gonna be hard to make a change and be like hey let me correct that because to them it s just like all fun and games but to us it s like okay yeah it stopped it died i agree completely with what laticia is saying although for instance how sam was saying about dave chappelle although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner it s not like people make jokes so people understand that oh we need to break these stereotypes i ve come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it obviously yes by making these stereotypical jokes yes we re addressing it but my point i guess is just it doesn t necessarily prove that people are anti racist alright i just wanted to say the question the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti racist and it s because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being from when we re born we re exposed to racism consistently and because of that we can t be passively anti racist our default setting for the most part is being racist not overly racist but we are so it s not possibe just to not be racist by being alive once you come to being in this world you are racist you can t change that so that s why there s no such thing as being passively anti racist you have to work at being anti racist it just doesn t happen so i completely agree with what wyatt s saying the way i look at racism is it s like a poison and once you ve been injected or you know whatever to it it stays in your system forever and there s always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there s always gonna be a little bit of it in you so before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it which would be parents or teachers i don t know i m a source of it you know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like oh yeah my teacher said this and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around i don t know it s not you i m just saying i don t believe you yeah i agree with wyatt and brooks because i think that we were talking about how disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says basically right there are always implicit messages which aren t necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things there are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples speaking so everyone s totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words so yeah if someone s gonna hit you in the face it might as well be this i want to go back to what brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism i mean how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists they don t even try they might just give you some parental info on your surrounding or just say those joke you were talking about so you re saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids i m saying that parents should know how to combat racism and they don t even try going back to what ryan said earlier i agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich so people won t want to use it anymore,0.0
in the lion king like i was thinking about it there s no democracy in any of the movie no there isn t yeah and how the lion king s like everything seems really british you know like very england monarchy type stuff but in the lion king what bothered me is when it said like the two hyenas like cheech from cheech and chong was one of them and then whoopi goldberg was the other one i was just like how could they do that and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas like don t they think about that stuff yeah i was thinking the same thing did you think about it before when you first read cinderella i think when i watched the lion king like i thought about it i mean even when i was little i think it registered in my mind like that s a black woman s voice why would her voice be in this animal and not any of the other voices right i don t know disney intentionally did this they were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes so i think the mentality of that was why fix what s not been broken and when they should have fixed it but at the same time mufasa was that really what s his name james earl jones who s like morgan freeman right mufasa was an evil like if i had to pick a god it would be james earl jones or morgan freeman mufasa was the good simba s father right yeah with like the really deep voice you made a good point though about no democracy in disney movies there isn t because there s no democracy in marketing there s no democracy in the media what are the six big media conglomerates disney disney ge what else ge ge newscorp yeah newscorp then viacom viacom time warner and time warner but why can t cinderella be a first lady why does she have to be a queen like why can t she have some other magical power why can t we instill some like actual life in there but that s still not this is still not the classic but then i wouldn t be surprised if disney will come up with another story i hope they do well they came up with tiana right which added the gender stereo the roles the racial roles or the racial stereotypes tiana is absolutely beautiful the image however there are again the pre existing culture and norms that disney is too scared to move away from because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry i did promise you a reading on we do have time i promised you a reading on china as to what happens in china before i do that i just want your input on the disneyfication of children s culture with the article that you read i know you wanted to talk about it you were really excited if you have your article in front of you you can use that you can look at it i also jotted down plenty of notes but when you reflect on what we did today i want you to think these books these books are books are media music is media videos are media okay food for thought for next time when we have our discussion does media construct an image or a message there s no right or wrong answer but think about it does the media construct an image or a message okay as you read your read articles so hannah to you go ahead the whole like aladdin where how they changed the verse the lyrics that was like awful that was crazy like i think i have a different opinion from everybody like truth hurts to me i think it s just like i don t care that it says that like i didn t notice that no one notices that while they re singing like while they re singing that no one like realizes oh cut off your ear kids don t like if your was in and that actually happened back then that actually happened the ear one didn t bother me as much because that s kind of true but the whole it s barbaric the like that was awful it shouldn t be because if you think about where it is if you look into the history it is barbaric and they used to do it and in some places they still do it it s the whole hammurabi an eye for an eye you know it s that culture yeah it s true it s true so why not teach what actually happened but i don t really have a problem with it i mean like but if that s the only way that you re looking at the middle east then that s wrong because they have a history with beautiful art they invented math and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff that you can t just look at the problems that they have now or the violence that was in their culture because there s violence everywhere i mean that s just stereotyping they cut people s ears off in the middle ages in england just as much as they did or at least as the same they did worse things probably in the middle ages than they did in cutting off people s ears it s just unfair that they portayed the middle east like strictly as a barbaric violent place in that song it just makes it wrong i think it was like in general and it was because arabia was so bad in an oasis like that yeah they weren t specific it was just arabia but like it took there was like indian things about aladdin that it wasn t supposed to be india it was supposed to be like israel or totally different there were a lot of like middle eastern elements rolled into one so it would make one thing like if you went to the middle east if you went to like pakistan it wouldn t be what they say it is or if you went to india or you went to israel like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one which looks like a different why did they do that what would you think they didn t look into it they didn t bother to do the research yeah they probably didn t because their culture is so different than american culture that they just thought that they could just skip over it like i thought it was gross that they didn t even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript like if it was in english they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper but they just you think that you can just go like this on the board and that looks like arabic writing that s not arabic writing is really complicated and the whole thing with all the accents how all the bad guys had accents and the good guys didn t the bad guys had like oh the beards and noses bigger beards and then the good guys they looked american i think it made you assume the worst like reading that just made me like wow like oh my gosh it s not really giving you the information but yet you didn t notice it when you watched it though right yeah i mean you didn t at all i did though but then when we re older we go back in history maybe that s because i have that class and we realized that it s all war with religion and like i know those times go ahead religion what about it she noticed that i did notice those things like you can kind of tell like different culturally wise like the different indian elements in israel or the different like pakistani influences but and they had like hindu going on it s just really really weird but i did notice that but like i don t know maybe like hannah said she didn t notice that but because she didn t grow up like learning to write arabic no and like reading about all that stuff i guess it s also like how you grew up right someone who showed america like without photos i have a question when you think about it when we talk about american culture we view it as pretty homogeneous of the american values okay there are these values and that s all there is but we know that that s not true do you find that to be with these movies by blending all of those different spaces and all those different cultures do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children that the middle east is highly diverse okay and not everybody looks the same or writes the same or behaves the same but disney has done something that the media does what does the media assume that everybody who watches a movie is going to react the same way it s going to react the same way right so the media assumes that homogeneity attitude yes the problems in the past 20 years in the middle east like when little kids grow up and it s like if i look at a picture of osama bin laden i think jafar because he has a beard and he looks like that like we re taught that that is evil do you really i don t that the person with the turban and beard is evil because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world just happen to be muslim totally extremist muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don t practice kind of like most christians during the middle ages didn t go out and chop people s heads off in the name of jesus it s the same thing right you know but we look at those pictures of those middle eastern men and we think bad because of it which is like jafar and aladdin that s when acceptance comes in like you have to accept what s true and what s not exactly talk about ignorance i mean why do we have to accept that because it s not true because it s not true there are thousand and thousands you don t see me going like oh i m making bombs i m not like saying acceptance like it s not true i m not like saying acceptance like osama bin laden like accepting that s what he looks like to like jafar like that s who he was so that s what he looks like you know what i m saying yeah but i don t see that if i see if i look at osama bin laden i don t see jafar no i don t either i don t identify it at all i don t either but you know what i m saying yeah like little kids like 10 years from now if they watch aladdin and they re going to grow up and what s going to be in the news is september 11th and osama bin laden but what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else like ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid and still done all the horrible things that she did to ariel right like it doesn t matter what you look like they create these evil images of people like all old ladies are either really smart or they re evil they either have wisdom or they re out to get you there s no in between or the zoo keeper in he had a german accent he was evil and that was during a war the movie or like the three crows right that were talking in like the very like i don t know african american inner city slang and they were just all that stuff that was just really it kinds of makes it like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like we have that image like up here like tell them it looks like this so when we see them we automatically assume like oh man it could be a terrorist just like when we watch a movie like oh that s the bad guy so like it s the same as if they re doing a cartoon and if we re in real life right so that leads to problems that we have with profiling for example putting people on one side or yes it doesn t really relate to the article but i was watching a movie with my mom and i don t know what it was called but there s this like i guess class project or oral presentation that someone had to do and this girl chose to write about her religion which she was muslim and she wrote about like 9 11 and she was like just because they did that doesn t mean we re all evil and like i don t know she had all this stuff and then the principal like told the fbi or something and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from just because of that that s it that s when like a school needs to teach acceptance that s not the end or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber and like go kill yourself or are you gonna bomb all of us and we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion i remember when i was in sixth grade there was a girl she was muslim and people used to throw markers at her and stuff and call her a terrorist it was around 9 11 and stuff like that and it used to like upset me because i used to feel really bad because she like didn t do anything she barely even knew how to talk they d like throw markers at her and stuff just because she was muslim like because like no one has acceptance like no one learns that it s just like people make inferences like oh man it s a bad person so let s stay away let s shy away let s make fun of them instead of like when you re going down the street and just like we were talking about earlier how there s like if you see a big black man you re gonna put your phone away you re going to take your phone out and try to call your mom put her on speed dial you don t have acceptance either like you may say we should get it but you don t have it it s just the way we grow up we don t suspend judgment you don t suspend judgment it s difficult to do so there is this conflict between acceptance and our values because the values that we have that think by this individualistic view of what it is and in doing so you divide people into groups and construct images about those people and it s as simple as reading a children s story okay or as watching or turning the tv on in the morning and just watching the disney channel or noggin or nick jr or whatever there s messages that we impart on our children there s messages that we impart on ourselves or picking up the newspaper i don t know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper but there is a big there s a dichotomy between how different areas are described immediate areas our city compared to our surrounding areas right so media is biased they re systemically biased okay there is no democracy but here is the fundamental thing as an american we pride ourselves in democracy we pride ourselves in leadership so what do you do what path do you follow how do you,0.0
you re totally fine so you guys will be using i m assuming a meter tape yeah for measurements and then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we re good strength versus strength qualifies ten times ok so i like that you re making everyone go clockwise everyone s doing ten alright and then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot ok there s a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on no shoes on ok perfect you guys are good ok so wingspan what are your units you guys are measuring in centimeters and you re going tip to tip right and then what was the ability again they ll take their shoes off try to touch their toes and then we ll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot ok good in what units centimeters centimeters did you say take shoes off or no yeah ok cool you guys can start collecting data i ll come back to you ok what do you guys got same thing we got yesterday recap me hair color you were hair color why the hell don t you have something else i don t know ok so here s my question cause i was thinking about this last night you re gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data how would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color ok so you re gonna assign numbers numeric data to shades zero to ten or one to ten one to ten yeah one being the lightest the lightest lightest we should probably get this straightened out before we do it right and then ten being the darkest ok before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm draw a line out so i could see where you re getting your number data and then what is your characteristic that was your characteristic what is your ability how many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet ok so we ll probably do that in the hallway does that sound fine meter tapes are up there that s a lot of guys so give me a real quick scale then you guys can start ok one and ten so that s blonde and really blonde and like really dark brown so where would red fall in like me like right there so you re gonna make blonde one end the low end are we all in agreeance on that yeah and mine is like in the middle ok and then the other far end s gonna be the darkest brown yeah or black or black are you gonna have everyone taking data on that or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color you know what i mean so there s not a ton of variation measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger and then hopping on one foot right on your tiptoe or no balance balance and then once your heel touch into the ground it s done and your hands can do whatever you want ok are we shoe on shoe off shoe off shoe off and is it right or left foot right foot for everybody ok right foot shoe off on tiptoe max two minutes max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground or their other foot or their other foot so it could be either or okeydoke so just a kind of a flashback to remind us this has been a couple daytime span here our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil so as we work through this unit we re gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past we ve been specifically as i ve said before looking at one specific fossil foot fossil length right the idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together we start to get a clear image of what s going on again our goal was to determine if there s a relationship between the characteristic you chose the ability you chose and a person s foot fossil i asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit that could be an indirect relationship a direct one a trend or no relationship what i m gonna ask you to do for a minute talk to your neighbors compare your data make sure we re on the same page in determining a relationship and then i d like you to come up and post your data it s gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data so for example if group one what was your characteristic for fossil length hand spans we re gonna put characteristic on the left side so they re gonna right hand span for us and then what type of relationship did you guys see for that direct direct so all you re gonna do is do this that s all we need to report ok in your lab packet you are going to find some little graphs you re gonna be asked to record everyone s data i ve also given you a supplementary sheet cause you re gonna need more graphs i messed up and didn t tell you so what s gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here you will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you ll be looking at everyone s data and drawing conclusions ok so take a minute to talk to your groups i ll come around and give you some markers determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are post them on the board and then we ll talk no can you determine it no cause they re not they re just kind of clustered it was like more not clustered ok so we re gonna have a trend fall in between where i guess the trend really is between 15 and what are we lacking you know what it was 12 30 last night fossil foot length stride length ok so we re having a trend falling between what s our lowest our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones ok i think that works so you re gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there need help ok whatcha got would you draw a line for a trend yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning so this person s kinda like an outlier right so let s just for argument s sake take them out does that help clear the data up at all you could say no it s ok they re all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times ok so we ve got a pretty wide range here right for trend we tend to see more of a skinnier range so if you look at our options it s definitely not a direct or indirect i would say based on what you showed me right trend wise it s kind of a wide range so what would we determine what s our other option no relationship yeah i would probably go so up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation ok here s your marker with this one cause it s kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area but then there s also the increase ok so here s my question that s a good question when i look at this data right if i had a pick excluding this line if i had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall where would you pick up here why yeah it appears to be going this way so that would indicate that you have a direct relationship it s kind of the easiest way to look at it ok group number one hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height what kind of relationship are we seeing here direct so the bigger the foot fossil the bigger the hand span so just to clarify hand span we re talking tip of thumb to tip of finger correct why do we see that so i asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section so you might want to turn to that page everyone cause you wanna gather some ideas here why are we seeing this why do you think we re seeing that relationship what did you guys say because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size you re not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands usually ok so i have a question for everyone in class i bought some new shoes and i like them do you like them they re so big on you they re a little loud don t worry i won t wear them on testing days they look good what s the problem here they re like way too big like twenty sizes too big how do you know why do you know that my foot s not this big yeah it doesn t look proportional to my body and exactly what megan said bodies in general are proportional now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long really lanky arms or you might know someone that has extremely long legs they re kind of fitting outside that pattern but in general bodies are proportionate right and so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics right because of this idea that we are proportioned you re not gonna see shaquille o neal wearing a size three shoe he ll fall over he wouldn t be able to support his own body common sense applies here that s a good one jump height so you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there s no indirect or direct relationship why do you think we saw that jump height is an ability versus ok jump height is an ability you are correct it depends on muscles versus structure ok so it s depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot i remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high i could jump in itself so i guess with your foot depending on what size shoe you have that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body by having them reach guys what was your point when you set up your lab cause i remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you re gonna have them make a mark and then they re gonna jump well it s so that the taller people didn t just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them cause then it s already the distance like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are ok so you re saying that by measuring the height you factored that idea in so mr bieber isn t totally outjumping say adrian who s a little bit shorter so you already kind of factored that in why did we not see a connection though megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe opposed to foot cause everybody kind of jumped the same there wasn t any variation so it didn t really matter what foot size you have ok so when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly they found the same general area in that same general pattern that s why theres a trend it was all in just one spot so in general when we re looking at fossils would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil no probably not which kind of makes sense anyway group two group two didn t get their data plotted but let s take a peek they did foot fossil length and height if you were to make an assumption if there was a relationship what would you all assume would be the relationship direct why direct cause it s proportional bingo bodies are proportional you re gonna see that pattern as we work through this proportional ok average stride we didn t really get a graph but it didn t look very direct it was a little more indirect more indirect i think so like this so you re saying longer no no like there wasn t really a pattern oh so your e saying no relationship yeah does that make sense alana says no i saw this why well just based on the proportional idea if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs so you re arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship i think a direct you would say direct claire and then barrett well cause we had the same thing but a little bit different and well backwards it couldn t really be that accurate because it wasn t a very long distance and people had different ideas of walking some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower it wasn t just like an average so you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct but you re saying you agree that we should see direct no we should see an indirect an indirect longer leg shorter strides direct longer legs longer strides but you re arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn t lend itself to collect proper data yeah ok good point i think it was also just i was asked just to walk like i normally do and i don t take very long strides i kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when i just normally walk ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am i supposed to walk so maybe we could have captured it in a different manner we could have designed the experiment if you re already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride i think no relationship is accurate because my stride length i would assume is based on how long my legs are i have very long legs but everybody knows i have a small foot i mean i m still proportional like i m normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else ok so you re kinda arguing that maybe you re not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional there was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides it was kind of just all over the place ok so what are we labeling this direct question mark no relationship question mark if we re basing it on the data that they had i d say no relationship ok if we re basing it on the data even though we didn t plot it looking at their actual data we would say no relationship could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship yes so for our data collection we ll leave no relationship but keeping in mind that very valid point that if you re gonna have longer feet more than likely you have longer legs more than likely you re gonna take longer strides but inherent as claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment that maybe that didn t shine through group three hair color versus foot fossil length no relationship is this shocking to anyone yes even though they had a great numeric scale why why no relationship bubs i didn t have anything to do with it it s like a gene base hair color is determined by your dna does your dna determine your foot length yes it does but not the same gene ok but not the same gene ok now you re getting very technical i appreciate that yes sir i think its partially because would you think that there would be a connection like smaller foot lighter hair well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others ok so maybe you re arguing the sample size the idea that we were to survey globally maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller would have different i could see that yeah well i think it has nothing to do with it because i m six feet tall and franco s under five feet and we both have dark hair so obviously yeah it s got nothing to do with it ok so on face value looking at hair color would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color no ok i would agree there s no connection there no connection my question though is there are organisms that lived in the past and we have very i would say we have certain ideas about what their coloring was like how would we come up with that then how would scientists come up with that idea of the coloring of certain organisms caroline well if you say that lizards would be or dinosaurs would be green it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don t know for sure so you re thinking evolutionary connection it ll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment yeah yes claire i think you also said a few days ago about how you re supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now so if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now ok so again you re doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color possibly due to some benefit we can assume in the past good nice job,0.0
so how is that energy different things like jules which are increments which are similar kilowatts hours and bcu okay you could also measure it with a thermometer if it s kinetic energy sometimes okay i have an cubic feet tons and gallons too that s mass and volume oh cause it was like hold on totally different thing i don t remember while she s looking at that what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about well there are no no explosions that s a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power oh i have and it states in lots of articles about nuclear waste that it produces very little waste at all well i have a cubic feet it s for like natural gas tons is measured for coal kilowatts hours is for electricity it doesn t pollute the air you could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it and then the disadvantages for geothermal energy is the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15 which isn t it s not that great and there s a limitation of it you can t just like keep reusing it and reusing it i think that would be like a possibility for a scenario but like we don t know if it s warm enough to be able to do that yeah if there was a good spot around our area it might be good but how would you know if your area was a good spot i don t know they would have to do tests and stuff plus i don t know that people would want it in their backyard it s hard because cranberry if we re thinking of where those people well like a civilized area people really don t want something that smells bad yeah that they don t want any disruption and where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from there are inside of the earth right but it s inside of the earth but it comes out in what ways in geysers in geysers or what else i m not sure volcanoes oh yeah so who that s definitely something you don t have volcanoes everywhere either yeah right and you definitely wouldn t want that in your backyard and sometimes if there would be a good area maybe the state or the country would buy the property to like put it there because it s a good spot sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff they like buy the property okay okay i had hydro electric and some of the pros that is it doesn t pollute at all and the actual running of the power plant is really cheap and then it s really reliable so say there was a big power outage in the area the hydro electric power plant could get that running again but it s run by building dams in rivers and they re extremely expensive to build which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that a different a business or something but it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals and people and houses i have a question for you do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here i don t think you could necessarily use the creek the connoquenessing yeah but yeah you have to have like a big river and it has to be fairly out of the way would it like cause flooding yeah you couldn t have any houses really upstream because could they d flood and for example your science book says that the hoover dam which is on the colorado river it created a waterfall of 400 feet which is more than twice as high as the niagara falls so you re talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop because the water creates the kinetic energy am i saying that right yeah and that s what causes the electricity correct so if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here that might that might work and again the whole yeah the three rivers that could do it because there s a bunch of big rivers in pittsburgh yeah yeah but if you build that up wouldn t that flood well not in the middle of the city you could maybe do it like out of the city cause the rivers aren t just like in the city they go out and also if you have a good area flooding wouldn t matter so much if you pick the right area which i mean i guess the whole thing so definitely not in cranberry here where we live well we get a lot of rain around here so i m just like flooding would be like a problem yeah we re sort of in a drought right now there s not been a big rain for a long time does it harm the animals that are in the river it s better for farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there s more fish and stuff but there s less plants and stuff like upstream it floods the animals and homes and so it doesn t really hurt too much down stream i guess it depends because the farmers need deeper waters but not if there s less life in it because that s what they re trying to achieve rachel tell us about yours my energy is fossil fuels the pros were that it s the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use it s easy to find if you know in the general area of where it s at it makes up half or more of our energy in the united states the cons are that it s non renewable there s a limited supply it makes a lot of pollution when it s mined it s expensive to transport it harms aquatic life with pollution it takes millions of years to form that s something i didn t know about fossil fuels that it takes a very long time to develop it has to be like compacted uh huh so maybe the big plant it might be able to not might be able it would probably run out fast if we started using it a lot so there wouldn t be a point in making this huge plant and then it just run out yeah so it might be something people would use more often in the future just little by little like just for little things what do you mainly use it for like energy but like what falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels coals and oils and natural gas yeah yeah and you said it when you mine it so we would have to transport it here there s so many people that live here that wouldn t want that isn t that what happened in mexico what s that called the gulf of mexico yeah weren t they mining for fossil fuels like oil oil yeah and that happens so that s like a natural disaster and that s happened a bunch of times so it s not that safe so for our scenario what do you think would be the best two maybe nuclear around here out of the way a little so it wouldn t create any huge explosions so thermal energy transfers into electrical energy so it s kind of like biomass cause they both you burn both of them except yours you use mine s not renewable yeah yours you use like uhm what s it called like plants fossilized plants and stuff and for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that actually isn t the isn t the fossilized or fossil fuels or whatever don t they keep on making them yeah fossilized yeah but it can t it takes so long to make them because you need all the pressure and the decomposing like plants and animals that once it runs out it s going to take a while for us to get more like thousands of years it takes to replenish yeah it takes a long time yeah it takes a very long time for sure so i think keeton i don t think yours would be the best for our community to use it s running out anyway yeah so how much pollution does it cause a lot why does the world just use it if it s running out why waste it we talked about the efficiency what s the efficiency cost of fossil fuels i wasn t sure i couldn t find the exact uh 38 to 47 that s actually really good cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something so that may have something to do with what your decision is right the efficiency of the energy i think so i just you should save some of it you don t need to save it but it s not that good of an idea to rely on this energy source that s not going to last forever that s why i say you could also use that as a backup plan because if we use something that s renewable like katelyn s or something but something like a disaster happens that could always be our just our fall back that we know we could use that if we have to just like an emergency generator it s like you know it s there if you need it you can use it and it can last for a little bit since it is running out would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case oh definitely save it save it i say save it too now i actually think save it because i think probably save it i would say to save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you ll be able to go back to it but if you use it all then you couldn t go back to it so what are you all proposing as your primary energy source biomass okay cause it doesn t cause that much pollution and then they harness that pollution like katelyn said they capture it and then they use it for different things like growing trees or cause the only thing that the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide and they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff wow interesting yeah i thought that was pretty good so i think katelyn s definitely provides the most for the community definitely out of all yeah i have high effiecency rates so you ll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it yeah the colorado river isn t actually renewable energy s that good of an efficiency rating actually actually the the hydro electric energy is nearly 95 efficient wow once you build it since tidal doesn t use any fuel either it s just once you built it but the down side on building is it costs so much so i don t understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things you could do it to create more biomass like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil plant roots or plants just try to find research to make that happen more quickly speed up the process so it wouldn t be a non renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything there s no they said the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that they only create like a small amount of energy and so we can t really do that in silicone valley what about the three rivers in pittsburgh could we not somehow harness that we were talking about that i was like talking about redirecting the river redirecting the river just making one big one yeah i think that we would be able to use the three rivers in pittsburgh because they re all pretty big rivers so if we just put like one dam in there and then we harness the energy from all three i think that we could get a lot of energy from it i don t think it d be enough energy like to completely rely on it i think that we d still have to use other resources to still create energy because i know the title it only creates 10 hours of energy a day but i don t know if that means like an hour of that energy runs like a power plant it didn t exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing so i don t i don t think that d be a good idea to completely rely on that and put it in the three rivers and doesn t then the with the title energy too there has to be a difference in the the low and high difference in the low and the high yeah three meters of low and high yeah so where did you find out where in the world there is that difference yeah they said the biggest title it was in france or something but we don t have any in the united states because we don t have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference oh wow so there s none used in the united states and i don t think we could use that then well what you were saying before about how like each energy source we basically have to fall back on another one yeah because none of them we could completely rely on to supply all of our energy i think that we would definitely need at least two choices at least two and if we had to pick two i would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way yeah like you only need a little bit and it can produce a lot of energy and the efficiency rating s pretty high it s like 35 so yeah wow that is pretty high remember you said it was like really hazardous yeah it doesn t produce a lot of air pollution or greenhouse gases but if like one small accident is made then it can cause like a really big disaster which would be bad for a community of people since there are so many people in it i think that katelyn and kelsey were talking about like different kinds of energy sources and according to issels uh issues,0.0
plug in two you got it we got it all right first question is once energy is used up it s gone for good talk to your partner no let s try that one more time folks eyes up here what was the rule on the darts the rule is don t do anything until you say so thank you don t act until i say so go yeah there could be a little bit left of potential is that what you mean yeah well all right on three i m going to need eyes up here please one two th don t flip your card until i tell you to i shouldn t be able to tell what your card is it should be much more secret they re colored guys i can tell what they are okay here we go on three hold up your card please one two three okay we ve got mostly disagrees and then we have very one confident oh we disagree so here s what we re going to do put your cards down i m calling on mark first so where should we be looking mark at mark okay okay so i strongly disagree because say so you know you when you you know how you eat food you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running and then you re out of energy you re tired you go to bed you wake up the next morning it comes back you eat more food and it comes back okay so you re getting it from a different source yeah okay but that energy you have originally so that initial energy that you have and then you ran does it go away yeah you have plenty more but does that original energy go away no where does it go because you still don t have it right you have to eat more food this is supposed to be challenging great job who has another idea or who can tell me where does it go it s awfully quiet awfully quiet what do you got i don t think it literally well i don t think it goes anywhere you just it just keeps making more it makes more so the energy i burnt right so i m running and i m running and i m running where does it go out out where to the air to the air in what form breath now this is tricky this is where it gets tricky breath is made of what vapor carbon dioxide water and carbon dioxide and we call that matter we call that stuff is stuff and energy the same thing no no and this is really a tricky idea in science so we re going to keep working with you on that so where does the energy go out into sweat out into now okay sweat is stuff it s stuff right but where so where does the energy go does anybody want to change their answer and say once it s used up it s used up for good anybody some people i think now tatum what do you think i think that when you run it s some of the energy go into the ground how many people agree with tatum that some of that energy is going to go to the ground oh yeah yeah okay in what form does it go to the ground in static stuff what s that i think you said static stuff is that what you say yeah okay so static stuff is now this gets really tricky because now we re getting into electrons but you re thinking about the rubbing kind of thinking is that what you re thinking how it rubs and then you shock people okay so that can happen that s a little more complicated so i m going to put that on hold for now but what so if i m running and that energy s going into the ground somebody said that who said that tatum tatum okay so tatum said the energy is going into the ground in what form is it going into the ground yeah energy transfer it is an energy transfer right this is going from my foot to the ground what form is it in do you guys know what i mean when i say form yeah yeah we talked about kinetic and potential and heat and what else we talked about elastic and light gravitational and light and chemical sound heat sound ooh there s just hey is any of that sound energy no no maybe it could be sound energy yes sound because you re you re stepping hard you re okay so if i m running i m probably going to produce some sound anything else that could go in there jason huh okay i think that as you step on you ll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on you all react to gravity to the ground so gravity s pushing down now remember what gravitational energy is is how far it is away from the ground right so how much room it has to fall basically so would there be if i go like this would there be any gravitational energy there wouldn t there be if you raise your foot now it s got gravitational here s what we need i m really doing something to say but here s what i want you to think about this one actually let s do this one more time i want you to re vote on this once energy is used up it s gone for good talk to each other for 10 seconds you re thinking it s going someplace else i don t know where but i don t think it just disappears for good i think it s going somewhere that it s somewhere but just not sure where yeah all right folks we re going to re vote on three one two three all right put your cards down for just a second here s what henry just said and i want you to raise your hand if you agree with henry and we re going to talk about again guys we re not getting answers to all these questions today we will at some point i promise we re going to do it in the formal labs but not before i m through telling you henry tell me what you just said i think that it s not gone for good i m not sure where it goes but i think it doesn t just leave it s still somewhere but i don t know where how many of you agree with henry that you think that it s somewhere but you re just not sure where i don t know where though all right do you know what form no no anybody else know where but wait doesn t it just transform it can transform into something else but then my question for you would be what what kind of energy is it all right but here s what we re going to do we re going to move on to the next one if a person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out ready set go what s the evidence that the box has energy what form of energy is that that s moving i don t know well it s kineck kineck one more try kinetic okay because it s currently in motion yeah okay all right so now here s what i want we re going do a challenge question what about the person what kind of energy does the person have who s pushing it that i don t know you guys all have it okay here we go eyes over here please are we a little bit on balancing in agreement all right here we go a person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out on three hold up your cards please one two three so what you re saying then is you all think the box does have energy am i correct yeah okay chloe tell me why what is your evidence that the box has energy i think it has energy because when you re pushing it it has a friction with whatever you re pushing it how many of you agree that there s friction there because it s rubbing against what the ground it s rubbing against the ground there could be some rubbing against you but most likely it s going to be rubbing against ground but here s my question what is your evidence that it has energy it does have friction and now it gives you some sort of indication that it s doing what moving it s moving what do we call that something s moving what kind of energy does that just shout it kinetic kinetic so it has kinetic energy so here s my next question so does anybody disagree the box does not have kinetic energy tate i didn t believe it i thought it was transferred i thought that it was energy transfer yeah okay so you think energy s being transferred from the person to the box yeah okay but the question is still does the box have energy even if i m transferring it there does it have energy while it s moving yeah well do you mean before the person i mean while i m moving it i m in the process of pushing the box does the box have energy yeah but don t you think part of it would be from you and part of it i think all of it is from you oh but does it still have energy yeah yeah it does so what s your proof chloe just said it what s your proof that the box has energy friction it s moving that it s moving okay now the friction is proof that s it s moving perhaps but you also see it moving that would be the proof that it s moving okay so here s my other question i m going to make this point this is too easy for you we re going to make this more challenging what about the person pushing the box so here is me this is how i push a box so if i m pushing the box what kind of energy do i have think about it jack what do you think kinetic how many of you agree with jack that i have kinetic energy how many of you think there s something else going on there as well no so i have i can only have kinetic energy right because i am moving pushing because i am moving and i m pushing okay what other kind of energy must i have i have to say something else like it s kind of helping to and what disagrees yesterday you told us the classic pool you re talking about energy transfer you guys know what she s talking about we re talking about the pool and handle yeah i think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the because you have the stick in your hand and you have the energy potential energy and then you start moving it and then it s kinetic and it goes through the stick and through the ball and it moves so you re saying that i have some form of potential energy as well yeah before you start and then in what form is that potential energy because i think emily was about to say this too think about this guys where am i getting my energy from is it gravitational no muscles okay so i ve got my muscles i ve got my body but where s that energy coming from food which is a form of what marcus fuel which is a form of what potential time out we re asking marcus marcus what form of potential energy is fuel um this is hard did you want a lifeline yeah anika can you help him out chemical chemical right make sense yes okay all right we re going on to the next slide are you ready yeah woo hoo hoo okay here we go now goodness gracious okay this is a hard one cold moves faster than heat ready set go and but also i remember my mom on hot days she s like don t go upstairs because it s hotter heat rises so is it is it move so your evidence that it s moving faster is that it goes up yeah and also when you put it in hot hot water it s looser because okay so you re saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well yeah faster than heat okay how about moving in other directions other than up is there do you have any wind okay so that would so does one move faster than the other tatum what do you think all right think about it all right here we go okay here we go so on three hold up your answers please one two three we ve got strongly agrees we ve got an in between we ve got an ooh we ve got a strongly agree and we ve got a couple in betweens all right we re mostly in orange land we ve got one green so here we go you ready yeah and stand together you re going to back them up yeah so okay so we agree that are you sure no just kidding because i think the answer you just gave me was certain so you re a strongly disagree okay well i read it wrong i thought it said heat yeah i thought it said heat moves faster than cold okay so tell me why you strongly disagree then tim well because there s just as heat rises so it has to be lighter to move and so it must be moving faster yeah how many of you agreed with this how many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing interesting and how many of you nope you guys it never crossed your mind okay let s hop to another tatum do have anything else to add to that no what is your evidence that cold moves slower because he was just saying heat was rising do you have any evidence that cold would move slower let s see alex what do you think well because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules they move faster when they re hot the coke can yeah the coke can investigation okay so i m going to ask them for specific evidence so what was your specific evidence in the coke can the hot molec that they were moving faster well there was steam coming out of it and then in the solid everything s molecules in solids are super slow and then as they move on to liquid then gas they move faster okay and then you need heat to make liquid into gas how many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold how many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold so let me ask you a question and i want you to think about it for 10 seconds then we might move on let s see what is cold not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold what is the idea of cold or coldness okay think about it for a second ellie what is cold well it s like it could be water that s frozen in i was thinking that heat moves faster than than cold because if something was frozen the molecules wouldn t be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that oh then it might be okay so she gave me an example of what is cold but is coldness so what what does that even mean what does that even mean anna shivering what s that shivering okay shivering is because you are cold what is coldness okay i think it s when the temperature is really low and everything s kind of darkness when you think of the sun warm it s really warm when you have the sun but it s when you think of something cold it s sometimes okay i want you guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is here s what i want to think about okay how to phrase this is there a such thing as cold and if so how would you define it it s a hard question oh you got to answer get ready to answer get ready and do one quick response and then we re going to put it aside for now and we re going to move on come on hunter no because it s just heat that s a that s just water that can be heated or heat heat is cold heat is that yeah it s like heat that s cold yeah oh so it s all just kind of a scale like you got hot over here and cold over here and you re talking about there s less heat over here than there is here heat has cold molecules heat has colder all right so here s what we re going to do we re going to talk more about this later we re going to move on to the next question for now here we go,0.0
so our question was what are the reasons why holden has a sudden acceptance of letting phoebe grow up and i got this question because i feel like the carousel represents growing up because you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you re not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you re just sheltering them and they re just going to live a sheltered life so they can t really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing yeah i agree with him with damon because i think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life because it never really stops just continuously goes around and around and the goal is to grab the golden hoop and i think that symbolizes i don t know happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it and if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants it s just like no i m not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want they re sheltering them from their own happiness kind of because i also agree with brandon but i also think that let s just say phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off i don t know if holden would go to her but i think based on his character he would but then i think that would be bad just because like brandon was saying if you don t let them fall if you don t let them make their own mistakes then they re not gonna learn from life so like my dad he s so overprotective i think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves not necessarily because i think that s their fear learning from their mistakes so i just think it s better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life i think people have a hard time letting go of any child whether it s their brother their sister their actual child because it means that they re leaving soon and they re actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister they don t want you to experience the same thing that they did too so they re like telling you what to do and it seems like they re telling you how to live your life but they re giving you advice i think parents the reason that they re so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss because it really is and innocence is in a way you know because you don t know and so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they re actually making them sad if they just won t relax so they can and also i think a lot of kids don t understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you ve been born they preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they re trying to shield you from everything but they re just trying to look out for what s best for you but you can t think of it like oh once this one chance goes by i ll never have it again because it really is like a carousel you re gonna keep going on and you will have another chance going back to the carousel i also thought that the carousel it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it so i think holden kind of realized that even though the carousel he knows have different people on it you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can t always keep them the same like the carousel it s not a real machine or something we all have to grow up eventually just listening to you guys what do you think about when i was home in los angeles my nephew at that time was about six months old and at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that like leaves you d show him an apple and he s like ahh and then he puts a leaf in his mouth and you re just like holy you have to dig it out kind of a thing so in one respect i mean it s just like there s this idea of let people figure out things on their own but in that respect he ll die if you let him figure out oh you can t eat that so i m just trying to think as far as a parent goes how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them and i think that s part of the conflict holden is having he s trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like i know that i have to let you go and i think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are like if you do what you re supposed to do and you show them that you re working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you that s true and i also think that it s not really based on yourself mostly it s based on your parents and how they ve grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it s just nature you just know when they re ready that s what i think i don t think really it s just based on all of their mistakes i just think it s pretty much based on interesting i think when people start changing and stuff like their attitude because i ve noticed my little brother he s starting to change and he has an attitude now he s starting to get a little rebellious and stuff and i think that s when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own and it s not just being told what to do and stuff you have to have that experience to learn from every person has their own free will like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can t make it drink you can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can t force them to do anything you can just have an influence on them and that s something that parents have to understand you can t force your kids to do their homework but you can ground them if they don t all right guys i want you guys to keep going you guys are doing a great job i can see your notes are also looking pretty good i m gonna move on to another group okay but keep this going because i think you guys can come up with a lot more okay thank you guys you guys are doing an awesome job with your volume we re gonna come over to this group over here all right can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up we have a couple of questions we have like oh okay let s just come up with tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about the first question is my question which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people and i kind of came up with that question because holden he kind of was denied of his childhood because allie died and so that really impacted him and since that he s kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of phoebe like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she s too big for it he s like no you re not he s trying to help to her keep that innocence or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied it kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing it goes against like parent versus child so a parent when they have a child they kind of want to live their life through their child and they make them do all these chores to get into because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn t want them to do it so they kind of interesting i said that i just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps i had these two other questions because i was reading the book where i was wondering why i was trying to get more in depth with why holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye okay so i kind of answered it and i said it s very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can t get back up just like when you lose your innocence you can t get it back because this experience happened if you get exposed to it you can t magically forget it it just stays with you and that s a part of you that s just lost interesting that kind of relates back to the question about it seems like holden is kind of holding onto his past and so he s still living in that innocent stage and when he s living an innocent stage he can t make a wrong decision which is very hard from his now because he s 16 he keeps transferring to all these schools and he can t really grow up because he still has that memory and so that s why he s confused about his identity good point going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people it kind of goes through influences too like he was talking about james castle and when he died he said that james liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about oh yeah that s a pretty great idea it s not bad but why would people be waiting for that it was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas and i think going back to that question again that sometimes parents want the best for their child so they convince their what they want their child to be if that makes sense and at the end sometimes you can t force the child to do what they don t want to do so in a way it s kind of like you guys said the parent versus the child they wanna form their own identity as a teen but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them is that what we re kind of getting at through everything they re so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go is that what we re saying yeah kind of like holden says he s trying to protect that innocence because he s always referring to there s a part where he s walking down the sidewalk and he called allie to help him cross to the other side and that s kind of interesting because usually you don t think an adult would say that a child would say that and it s because he s mad at his parents because they won t talk about it so he s kind of just living with this interesting so he s just trying to find a way of coping is that possible yes and then there was another kind of question about where holden comes to kiana said why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on and i thought of this question because when holden was inside just his room phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like you don t like anything you don t like anything and he was trying to make up stuff that he did like like he did say he liked allie and she ll say he s dead so pick something else and he was arguing with her saying that just because he s dead you don t forget him and you can still like someone who s dead and he thinks that allie is thousand times better than nicer than people who are alive today now so that just proves how he s holding on to that and he s not planning on forgetting that and he holds that near and dear to his heart and so that s probably why he doesn t like a lot of people because he compares them to how allie was and his innocence his maturity level how it was then and how he sees how people today because kids don t understand he s holding on so he doesn t really understand what s going on anything else to add on to this no i like what you guys are doing i like how you re tying in the death of allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing what about the carousel first of all i don t know it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all cause i know he would probably ride it too did he ride it i was thinking of repetition because how the parents feel it rotates around and round and whenever phoebe passed by he would tell her how pretty she looked she was never changing that s kind of what he wanted he wanted her to stay in that stage and nothing to change nice all right guys i m gonna check on another group i want you guys to keep going with this you guys are tearing it apart good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together all right and your notes look good as well too i like it i think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more okay hi guys you guys the volume is doing really well so you guys fill me in okay tell me what you guys talked about just mostly like and symbolism in the book start getting louder,0.0
um that one substance there s no other types of substances laced into the main substance okay and what is yours a substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it okay so i hear three different things here okay i hear pure means one substance not mixed with anything else i hear pure is something that s not altered or manipulated in any way and then i hear something s that natural i want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions so do you agree with those three definitions or not and tell me why and tell them why well i don t think it s natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures um like trees so what and you re saying a tree is a mixture because why because it like has different colors and different like feels to it oh so different colors and different feels so like different textures is that what you re saying and why does that mean that it s a mixture cause it s not all the same how do you know i don t know i don t what do you guys think do you agree with her that a tree is something that s natural but it s a mixture so and that was your definition that you got natural i would say it s natural like some things are natural some things aren t natural i guess cause think about like when a diamond forms it s a natural thing and it s only that substance sure i agree with you with that example a diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure but for your definition what i want you guys to think about is a definition that s true all of the time so for a tree i want us to use that example about a tree really quick cause you re saying it s a mixture right so you re saying it s a mixture cause you have different colors and different textures why is that statement different colors an indication that it s a mixture well it s like it okay and a difference between substances what is color an example of michelle characteristic properties characteristic property which we know what about characteristic properties it is characteristic to that one substance it s characteristic to that one substance okay so would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about yes okay so what i want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper okay hey you guys i know you re discussing it and i hope that you re kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions here s what i m going to have you do based on your conversations it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper that your whole group agrees on i ll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we re all on the same page or not okay we already had one discussion where we had three different definitions my guess is when i read what they write down they re now going to have an agreement on what a definition is but i may be wrong so let s see write your definition as soon as you have it done hold it up in the air pure substance same thing pure or pure substance okay so what do you want to do what was your definition my definition well huh what did you write literally first time the first time yeah the first time what did you write initially i wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like clean it s not dirty or anything good and then what did you change it to a pure substance is a substance that has not been touched okay and why did you change your definition to that like what made you did it happen because you guys talked about it yeah okay so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to something that hasn t been touched he said like a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the earth okay so you said it s something that naturally comes from the earth so is that what you mean by not been touched yeah so it s just natural and not manipulated by people yeah so it could have been literally touched but unprocessed unprocessed okay so give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists um tree okay so tell my why you think a tree is pure it hasn t been really been really processed or anything it s in the forest okay so then what do you know about color of substances um sometimes it s a characteristic property it is a characteristic property right which means each substance has it s a certain color and for that substance it will always be that color when you think of a tree do you see one color or do you see multiple colors sometimes multiple multiple colors so what is that evidence of multiple colors characteristic property it is a characteristic property but i mean how is having hey brett can you please focus on what you need to be doing do you have your definition done yes okay here s what i would like the rest of you guys to do including brett s group you now if you have your definition written down i want you to go ahead and start doing number two give me your examples of pure substances and give me your explanations i m going to give five minutes for that that means 10 38 so a tree has multiple colors green is going to be an indication of of what would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance not really no okay why not because leaves or grass bark is a tree okay so you re saying that more than there s more than one substance maybe that can be green okay but okay so that s fine if there are different colors of green do you think that means different substances no what about characteristic properties though what do you know about a characteristic property it never changes for a substance it never changes for a substance so if i have two different greens do you think i have two different substances no i would cause that s the definition of a characteristic property right one green would be characteristic for that one substance always never ever something different if i see a different color that must mean i have a different substance okay if i have two substances together do you think that s a mixture or pure mixture mixture so a tree do you see multiple colors on a tree yeah what does that indicate a mixture a mixture of multiple substances is a tree natural yeah yeah so does that affect your definition for pure if you re saying it s a mixture it can t be pure but it s natural so maybe our definition needs adjustment so think about what you might change your definition to be now okay okay and write one down are you done with this problem it s anonymous okay well then water isn t is it oh interesting so you guys you don t know if water is or isn t you explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and something else okay so let s okay well what s the chemical formula for water h two o h two o so what elements are combined to make water hydrogen and oxygen okay so i agree with you there hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together which makes water okay so do you think water is pure or a mixture well when they do the water definition we were trying to decide like if something s straight like we could some not a mixture okay then is it pure okay i m going to read your definition really quick okay so a pure substance is a raw substance nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature there is no trace of any other substance it is not a mixture okay i see two definitions in there here s what i see i see a definition that talks about it being i see three one your definition is something that comes from nature another one i see is something that has not been changed another one i see is no trace of another substance so that sounds like one substance okay those are the three definitions i see but is there a substance from nature that hasn t been changed no water is a substance from nature that hasn t been changed i mean yeah we add things to it it hasn t been changed but it is a mixture is it a mixture though yeah but what about when like animal live in it and stuff does it change so you re kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way if it gets in contact with something else yeah if they re even from nature so here s what today we should be able to figure out by the end of the period and you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure here is my hint my hint to you is the way we can tell by looking at something if it s pure or a mixture cause you can or maybe not just by looking but experimenting with it it s based on characteristic properties of matter that s what i want you to think about so it s just the primary colors then what do you mean primary colors well the primary colors i don t know it s just that color so is color a characteristic property of matter yes what does that mean then wait but can t you change it when something s a color but when you add one color to something like if i add a color to the water doesn t it change the water when you add a color into water it mixes with the water so it s not still water it still tastes like water i didn t say that i just said it was mixed it s a mixture oh okay i didn t say that either but if you put the food coloring in it so and why are you saying that s all of a sudden a mixture because they re so different substances together okay so what then does pure mean not mixed a substance by itself a substance by itself so you believe water is just a substance okay alright alright you guys these crutches are going to kill me are you okay those hurt you re hurt okay you re okay we re going to talk about it right now okay do i have everybody s piece of paper are you done okay this is not true really yes alright turn here and stop what you re doing listen to what what i want i know that you may not be done with your examples yet because you re still struggling with your definition of pure i want to show you what other groups are thinking so i m going to show you all these i ll ready them for you too so that you re going to see that we have differences and the idea is by the end of today based on what we do you should be able to change and finalize your definition okay and competently be able to give me examples alright so the first one and i ll try to move this let s make sure you can see this if it s hard to see tim will you turn off actually why don t you go ahead and do that now tim i think it will be better i don t know but just the front set of lights thank you we ll come down okay the first definition an unprocessed material which is one substance by itself instead of combining multiple substances to get the material i see two different definitions i see one pure means to be unprocessed and then i see another one substance by itself okay here s another one a pure substance is only one substance that is not a mixture so you re starting to see that pure and mixture which i will agree with are basically opposites of one another so you ve got to explain the difference between them so a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture so i m wondering what your definition of mixture is who wrote does anyone who wrote this one are you willing to share do you have a definition for mixture then um well multiple substances that are mixed together good so you re saying so great your definition for pure is one substance while mixture would be more than one substance okay this one says a substance that has no mixture involved so you re saying that there s a clear difference between the two i still don t quite see a definition for the word pure yet in this definition a pure substance is a substance with no other substances mixed in it is one single substance so i m starting to see a little bit of a trend a pure substance is a raw substance nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature there s no trace of any other substance it is not a mixture so we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different but i see three definitions one it s something that is raw or something that and i think this is what this is saying correct me if i m wrong but you mean by raw kind of in some way connected to natural okay so something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other so i kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple okay as a definition okay maybe i only saw two okay oh i thought this one was typed i was like how did that happen how did was that you is that your handwriting that s insane okay i like it it s like prefect woah okay there you go alright a pure substance is a substance or material that hasn t been mixed with any other substance it is only one substance okay um two two more a substance is only one substance and it is not mixed with any other substance right and our last one oh this one s actually different a pure substance is an element okay that s a different definition than the other things i ve heard they are made up of one atom they are not mixed with other substances nor do they contain other substances within them so i hear two definitions in here one being pure means that it s just an element and then i see another one that it s a single substance okay so i want to hear some of the examples you re coming up with right now and i m not going to say if they re right or wrong i m just going to try to probe you with some questions okay naud what is one of your examples salt okay so you say salt is pure why do you say salt is pure because we don t think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt so you re saying that to be pure means one thing one thing in that container and you re saying if it s just salt that must be pure mm hmm okay miriam it has to be raw and like like plain like raw salt like not like mixed with preservatives or okay so literally just salt that s it yea okay alright so let s take another example or if you disagree with them you can also offer up your argument for that shaina what do you think well we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance why well i think a diamond can only be cut by itself and can only be cut with a different diamond ok so that s really dense so we thought that if anything was added to it something else would be able to cut it and that would be something else that was less dense so interesting what is um you re talking about density what is density it s a characteristic property a characteristic property so this is good you definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter okay that is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is hannah a property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance yeah a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount so what i m hearing you say is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density and you re saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond it must mean that the densities are the same and so since the density is the same for the whole diamond that means it s one substance,0.0
okay so put these where they need to go on the board and liz your job is graphing so harper tell me about your data you your plant is 20 centimeters okay and it s grown 11 centimeters wow that s a lot of growth isn t it good job and emma what s your job you were the recorder and so some of the observations the leaves are bigger it has grown bigger in the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves cool in the middle of the leaves there s tiny leaves that is interesting and your cotyledon has come off okay so that s good excellent okay so coby you re going to be using the board and putting your data up there so tell me how high how tall is your plant now 20 centimeters okay let s go check your graph we re out of room i have more so next time you ll have a graph that will be take two of this and it will be 40 centimeters because 20 plus 20 is 40 so here s your 20 centimeter line what needs to go down here okay now remember to help parker with observations natalie does the board oh natalie go up there okay girls let s talk about what your findings are because just a second talk to me about what happened with your plant let s take a look so what do you think has is the reason for it not changing it was 10 centimeters when you started it was 10 centimeters again on monday okay but that s okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination it s done with that now and it can grow without it is it a growing plant looking at your graph is it growing so maybe the leaves will get bigger and then the roots will get bigger too the roots will get bigger the water and the nutrients okay let s take a look at your observations roots longer white root cotyledon fell off leaves are pointy bigger leaves now what did we observe about the growth about the growth of the plant what did we observe about it i think we should include that in your observations okay so observer should record that okay boys and girls i need all board job people to come on up here okay now you guys one at a time are going to fill in your data make sure that you re choosing a new color and i m going to make sure that these have seen all of your i don t think i ve heard about your growth here okay tell me about what happened joshua you need to go sit down work on the math you re not ready for that yet okay so talk to your group and see what you need to do next okay so tell me about what has how about the growth right now it is okay so alex yes go get some now your plant has it s 12 centimeters now it started at so how much total growth has okay so it started at the 10 and now it s a 12 so can we make that who s the recorder so we want to make that because this is how much is it growing okay so it s growing and let s look at our graph you ve got your day and now oh so you went up a little bit too high here let s take a pencil alex and just do a small x right there so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12 maybe more so that we can see it keep erasing it that s good don t play with your plant please if you re all finished you should be working on the math problems okay now let s talk about your plant okay let me come around here tell me about your plant it started to get bigger the shell was growing out and we it s and how much has it grown total 50 oh five five that s right you started at seven and now you re at 12 so the difference between that s exactly the same as my plant too what i noticed about yours is over the week it came out of like you said the seed cover came off and the leaves started to peel and it started to break yeah okay so the stem is really long let s put this up here the leaves are bigger who is the observer you are okay and can we see something about the seed cover okay so while he s doing that we need to do some important things here what about the date one 30 goes here because that was monday one slash 30 okay and today s date is okay and that s it because today s the third and this bar shows natalie go sit down this bar shows that good job you guys and you ve got that added and let s make sure that we re gentle with that measuring you can work on it together molly stay with your group you guys work on that together you guys can work on it together so you guys have had what s the most common number of seeds they found five five good how about the total number of seeds now do we know is each dot worth one okay so what s the total number of seeds so how many seeds in all okay boys and girls sophia s finishing up if you have math extension problems in your table group please put those to the side and i m going to ask chloe s group and angel s group and derek s group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we re close to our graph you do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already chloe come join us please alright ashton and josiah you can move closer so you can see or you can stay there coby and isaiah please come join us alright now one last person needs to fill in her data let s see that would be me and my height was 16 okay so while i m doing that take a look at the graph we just built and think about what are some things that you notice about the graph what do you see what are some things in common what are some things that are different turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph okay eyes on me now you tell me what are some things that you noticed about the graph alex that six and three has the same height as us okay so group six and three and you are group five five all have the height of all the way across and it s 10 12 centimeters that s right so we have three groups that have the same height ashton what did you notice so group one four and your group eight they re all not matching but all the other ones have a match so group eight and one and four are separate they don t have someone who s kind of similar so that leads me to ask about groups two and seven tell me about them blake seven and two are the same seven and two are the same they both are the same why keith because they both have 20 20 centimeters so what group on there has the smallest plant alfredo what group on there has the smallest plant group four toby and how tall is group four s plant ten centimeters ten centimeters that s right now group four molly tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant,0.0
okay so tell us a little background about ed alright well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious okay so because of his complaining of chest pains be subtle from conscious or no he called and he talked to the paramedics but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well how do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition generally it can clog your arteries what can clog your arteries the fat that builds up okay from being obese yeah okay is that one of the i guess physical signs that someone may have a heart condition yes okay okay alright go ahead it is also his blood pressure it said it s at variable levels so that means his heart isn t working properly or consistently so that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system it could damage it it s also another sign of a heart attack okay so the variable heart or actually the variable blood pressure and some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research you were wondering what did this variable mean and i think what you said is exactly right it s not normal okay they state the variable meaning it wasn t working how it should okay so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history so tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let s say you ranked who was your number hmm who was your second who proceeded him nelson nelson so you got ed ranked over nelson where some other people had nelson ranked number one so what do you think well he s unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately and since his heart attacks aren t his title he needs it i think it s important to see to get treatment to get medical care yeah okay if he doesn t get treatment what do you think could happen probably he ll die from the heart attack if he doesn t get treatment or paralyzed what do you mean by paralysis why do you think he could become paralyzed i m not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not okay you re not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis yeah anybody like to comment on that question go ahead jordan it s a stroke it has a brain clot and then that will cause partial i can t say it paralysis yeah that word but heart attack you could have a heart attack after that using different parts not paralysis good point so jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis what system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis what system in our body is that nervous system yeah nervous system okay understand doban jake got that alright so you guys have ed you ranked him number one and then you ranked nelson number two along with quite a few other people it looks like we have some consistencies there let s look at group b you had nelson ranked number one but then you did have ed ranked number three so you didn t think ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to nelson and or monique well nelson and monique had the most critical vital signs they seemed the most the worst because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic so they were not and they were dehydrated too when your body starts to dehydrate that s not it really messes up all your systems so they were what systems cardiovascular system the respiratory system the immune system everything s just being attacked here because with eve let me see this his heart rate was way below normal and that s the cardiovascular system his temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon what s the normal body temperature for that of a human the normal temperature is 98 6 and he s at 109 he s at 109 folks okay i think this was one of our hypers if you remember nelson and monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital okay so he s at 109 isn t this like the immune system mmhmm yeah so that s the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down it s at 10 respirations per minute 10 respirations per minute and the normal s like 20 so he s down to half so i think that his vital signs were way more out of whack did you count in on the blood pressure the blood pressure it s really low and that means his circulatory system s not working right which means blood s not getting everywhere it needs to be which means he could end up having i don t actually know if it would lead to a stroke but like if everything s not getting blood everywhere his brain might not get enough blood he could have brain damage or something like that it s interesting she said stroke talking about nelson was nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms seizures it was seizures he was having seizures is that is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system absolutely think about all the systems you just named what s going on with nelson cardiac nervous circulatory immune dehydration entire bringing in dehydration digestive not enough water this guy is having a rough time isn t he so if you re pretty confident in why you ranked him number one yeah okay comments anybody well the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because monique yeah because she has a better chance of survival so you ranked him three and it s interesting you said we thought he was going to die he was maybe beyond that point of help yeah okay so why d you rank him three why not rank him seven well what if he has a shot he s got a chance yeah okay he has a chance over mark that wound to the chest yeah because mark got shot in the chest didn t he you d save him though it s interesting you said if he has a shot mark s the one that got shot he was more stable than nelson was though mark was mark was more stable yeah interesting you re bringing in the whole fact of now you re triaging it you re saying okay mark s a little bit more stable even though he s got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot we don t know what kind of gun it was but i feel like if you rank him a three he s at such a critical position that it s either you rank him one because he needs treatment right away or he s going to die okay so you re saying he s got to be one based upon all the symptoms based upon his vital signs the condition that he was brought in if you re not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die is that what you re saying or early on like you can t wait too long i guess you ve got to rank him one to three otherwise so he s like what group were you we re f you re f so you had him okay you had him at a two yeah okay alright so you re saying he s a top three yeah especially you had a hand up oh i was just agreeing with him if we thought we had any chance we should be like let s not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven okay good point brian well were were thinking speak up a little bit please well we were thinking that even though he s unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient but compared to like the other ones like albert or mark his symptoms weren t that of like great danger as the others and even though his body temperature was 109 that could have been because he was going through heat stroke but now that he s in asprins they re a cool environment you bring up heatstroke why do you think he s going through a heatstroke well i don t know because he was unconscious and they said he was dehydrated and everything well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like i also figured it d be heatstroke because his daughter monique yeah i m sorry monique it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as nelson was then it s more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she s going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it s most likely that he is too because they re both in the same environment very interesting i want to come back to this point ryan you ve got your hand up what were you going to say i was just going to say that monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke you re exactly right now my mind instantly goes somewhere here jordan your hand was up first i was just going to say that since their temperature s so high they re probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels so just putting them they re going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment or really cool compared to where they were if they ll put them into more shock which can also be fatal which means they re not exactly just because they re in a hospital doesn t mean they re necessarily going to get better right away okay obviously they need some treatment you don t want to go from one extreme to the other but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit yeah they need to get cooled down and what else do they need water water lots of water correct yes you can t really say that monique s symptoms can apply for albert too because monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting so that s probably what most of the symptoms are from we forgot about the bee sting it says she s dizzy nauseousness has cracked lips is having difficulty breathing has a rash on her legs and stomach okay she got stung by a bee like you were saying the reason we put monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee it shows here that with the difficulty breathing the bee sting her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or epipen getting what epipen you know what it is just say epipen epipen yeah epinephrine epinephrine yes it should elevate them in the largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like respiratory system is closing off she loses her breathing possibly absolutely she s having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here here s where my thought went and i said we d come back to this point maybe sean you were going to comment or somebody else they re both out in the wilderness this canyon they re both having heatstroke symptoms actually monique got stung by the bee she s having separate issues there you don t see anything else different about these two individuals sean one got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top do you think that would have a difference in their physical one gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what third of the way excellent point you know what s the other issue between these two jack you know well like they re both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke but monique got stung by a bee and at the same time nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms so it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off interesting interesting yes would it be their age age excellent look at the difference in their age how old s monique 18 yeah she s 18 nelson the dad right he s 51 i m not saying 51 is old but there s a big difference between 18 and 51 plus the fact you add in what sean said he s got to hike out of this canyon he s going to try to find help right is he having to expend a lot more energy yeah and he s got to go uphill he s go to go uphill yeah it s hot he s got no water he s got to go uphill he s losing basically control of his body no energy no water erin and that s why we had nelson as number one and then monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem but nelson was having it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything and monique she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee so it wasn t like so we put her close up to the top because there was she s already been waiting for long enough she needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon so they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they d been struggling long enough absolutely what during our discussion we were kind of using speak up a little bit sorry okay so during when we were discussing the age we were thinking also monique but which group were you real quick e you were e okay so like what we thought was that since monique is 18 years old verses nelson is a 51 year old well like it makes sense that monique has a stronger immune system because she s more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas nelson could be different but we don t know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure it doesn t show but i m just saying in general we were writing specific about his other health because i wrote that down age related diseases age related diseases yeah so we re missing some medical history yeah so it s possible there because he s older and because his immune system isn t as strong as monique s is we have to like or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter s absolutely as doctors medical history is so important it s so important in the triage process and we ve been through this folks you know you go to the doctor s office you go into the hospital you know in addition to while they re taking your vital signs what are they asking what are they asking when you go in medical history oswell have you had any previous stuff what s stuff mean like surgery so like problems okay other medical conditions yeah okay what s another question they ask very simple has it ever happened before has it happened before is it hereditary could it be hereditary what s your family s history and i think that s what brian you were relating to back there what are you here for today okay let s look back in the chart should i at this moment when he comes into the hospital he s obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped oh so you re asking about you re referring to nelson yeah because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon but because it s so low i would guess that he doesn t have a history of high blood pressure okay you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it blood pressure is obviously low i think we addressed this a second ago why do you think it s low sarah because everything else that s going on it s also affecting blood pressure yeah i think i truly believe with the limited amount of information we have i truly believe that because of the dehydration the heatstroke the no energy no nutrients i literally think this entire body all the systems shutting down shutting down i really do think that but it s a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure s 85 over 50 does anybody has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before okay 85 over 50 that s low i mean that gets to borderline point where you know you re dizzy i mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system it s not high enough i mean that gets borderline with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up i think his body s just shutting down and you bring up a good point but i think in this case just with everything else going on i think his body s just shutting down okay honestly on the side of that besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help during the scenario that he s in high blood pressure like with it s problems that it could cause with it s possible weakens the heart could have actually killed him during the long extended time of trying to get to the paramedics that was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people that this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without and plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there s no possible low levels that could even cause problems true yeah blythe like on the graphs i feel like there s nelson his blood pressure and the blood pressure of elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas nelson was 85 over 50 but we just talked about how like nelson s blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be but with elder he has a head injury and,0.0
yeah the oil okay so we discussed that one so maddie is going to write down about the peanut butter what the observation was at the first observation it was 9 centimetres and it has grown in joshua s words it has grown good and you re gonna do that for all three of them okay um the peanut butter no we just did the peanut butter oh no i mean the banana it s it s it s grown like 4 inches taller its like 1 1 and a half inch taller its like one and half inches okay what is that look its like 9 and a half 10 and a half 9 10 and 12 that s 1 2 3 we re looking at the bananas yeah wait that s half an inch alright so did you get that were the cheetos recorded okay good alright so now we ve got let s look here josh go ahead and read number 9 compare and record the results from all three fat absorb absorption observations observations observations okay so we re going to look at all three here we ve got our data laid out here look at your cheetos um the first time cheetos was eight and a half inches the second time it was 10 and a half inches and the last time it was 12 12 centimeters so what does that mean joseph what do you see when you see those numbers going like that um its like growing because every time you check one its like a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on and it gets a little bit more big so basically the longer that the cheetos sat on the paper towel the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel right okay so um josh if you ll just go ahead and write that down about the cheetos and hailey what did you notice about the next food the apples um two times it stayed the same and one time it got a little bit smaller just got a little bit yeah okay it says two are the same and one is just a little bit different and that could have been just um where is our centimeters it could have been just human error where we just sort of measured a little bit off okay um cause if you look at this apple sample here there isn t really any coming out of the green circle is there so nothing was absorbed from the apple did you see that okay alright so if you ll add that to our list that we ve noticed we observed shemaire you look at those potato chips i m going to leave that one here tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips the potato chips talk real loud for me um ok the potato chips they like changed each time like the first time it was 5 the second time it was eight and a half and this time it was 7 and what are those that you are talking about what units of measure centimeters centimeters okay so we want to make sure we get centimeters written in on there okay uh huh alright so what does that tell you about potato chips um that its not like that fat it doesn t got that much grease in it cause pretty much it showed like it was lower and then it got a little bigger then it just got a little bigger okay so comparing the three here what do you notice pretty much that this one has more fat than these two it looks like with this observation just this one here in class today and later we re gonna do we ll look at the food labels of potato chips and cheetos but right now just on our observations it does look like the cheetos have more fat right now okay but when we start reading its gonna be potato chips oh that leads us in it s gonna be cheetos so go ahead so um let s look at number 10 read that for us josh what can you conclude from the observations and recorded data which snack has the most or least amount of fat so you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there put most and least fine okay i d say the apples have the least amount of fat and the potato chips have the least the apples have the least amount of fat then the potato chips second and the cheetos is last and why do you think that might be why do you think the banana has expanded the most because its i don t think its because of the fat in the bananas and getting in talk loud i don t think its because of fat with the bananas that s getting oil on the paper towel because bananas are pretty healthy and they don t really normally have fat in them yeah yeah okay so that s your background knowledge you are aware of that what were you gonna say it s like its not fat or oil its like its just water maybe water absorbed in it what prediction would you make if we were to let this sit over night to where like the water would have time to dry up what would you predict this paper towel would look like tomorrow let me go with tray it would be all wet and soggy so you think it would actually be more wet yeah okay emily what do you think well i would think that the way it is now that the paper towels are gonna end up like that and the bananas would get all and more disgusting and okay does anybody think that the banana might that the wet watery part might dry up maybe i think it would expand a little bit more and then start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too okay well alright we ll actually leave that one out and see and we ll check on it tomorrow and see what it s doing and we ll kind of answer our own question there okay okay wait we re not finished what do we say about the banana you have to talk louder though the banana i guess the banana like expands the wetness it expands a couple centimeters like a half a centimeter good use of centimeters i like how you re using the actual mathematical term there the centimeter is good okay while she is writing that i m going to let tray go ahead and read that next question well if you can see it maddie will you let him read that so we can kinda be thinking while your finishing up there um what can you conclude from the observ observation and recorded data what snack has the most most and least amount of fat well um as my opinion i would think that the banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge okay josh well i would think that the fudge has the least amount cause it has the least amount of absorbed like grease and fat but the banana has like all this oil water and all that like sinking into it okay maddie i think that the peanut butter has the most amount of fat because um like i said earlier the bananas are more healthy than the peanut butter and it s probably just water and this is like oils and salt and stuff making it more greasy and that s probably more fat absorbing into the paper and then the fudge hasn t had very much at all so i would say it has the least amount of fat i would agree with like most of y all because the banana and the peanut butter is like has like a lot of wetness in it and the fudge has like a little bit of wetness like a centimeter yeah about a centimeter but also the bananas could have the least amount of fat because they are healthier and that s probably just water compare the results to the original group hypothesis our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat talk loud our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat our group decided this after discussing cheetos versus potato chips deep fried and adding salt and cheetos are made out of cheese so cheese is made out of milk from cows which is healthy oh wow lots of thought went into that okay so read that question again how do we compare our original hypothesis to what we ve discovered now in our research we were wrong say that again we were wrong okay so according to our data what did you find why do you say we were wrong because like the cheetos they had like a bunch of fat grease and stuff talk louder and the potato chips they like barely have any they had some but it wasn t quite what you were thinking right what were you gonna say josh we re gonna come right back to you no yes joseph she thought it was the cheetos which we thought it was that and afterwards now since we found out that it was probably the cheese talk loud when it gets stuck on you fingers it s all wet and oily and everything okay no she s the one that said cheese was healthy okay well think about it some cheeses are healthy this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese added to the cheetos right go ahead josh what were you gonna say she said that maybe the salt from the potato chips could ve dried up the grease maybe okay hailey pretty much what josh said it s the same okay so you just agree with that so josh maybe you could all just write down some of what you all discussed about the change from what our prediction or our hypothesis was to what we found now okay and hailey if you want to go ahead and start some of our discussion questions okay based on our discoveries from today what snack has less fat joseph um apples claire definitely apples josh apples yeah apples when you go home today what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why joseph i d probably do the apples because it pretty much has no fat which we learned and i d probably want to eat no more cheetos since i found out how many fat was in them now never again never oh you wouldn t live would you very good hailey say that again i wouldn t eat cheetos very often you wouldn t eat cheetos as much but in limited quantities right okay very good shemaire which snack would you choose i d probably have to say apples too because they are healthy either way and i love granny smith apples they re my favorite oh good good healthy snack eater i m going to have to say now since we found out cheetos how much fat it has then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there we probably don t know how much fat is in there right well we re going to look at those food labels closer now that we ve investigated these and see which one really does have more fat the potato chips or the cheetos,0.0
okay i can see two in here can you read the article first please yes loudly the president of the republic should be an egyptian born to egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights his age must not be less than 40 gregorian years mm hmm i agree with the president um mm hmm he should be egyptian born to egyptian parents because it will have make him have well rounded perspectives and it may lead him to having interests to other countries and so it would make him have interest or will not make him prevent him it would not prevent him to um from getting to a different country s interest than his country okay good job i agree with yessenia because if both if he s from parents that are egyptians he can have some connection with egyptians and he won t have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have and um have like wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different mm hmm that s what i that s what my opinion yeah that s why i agree with her good i disagree with the part of the where it says that they should be egyptian parents mm hmm but i agree with jesus and his concerns about the egyptian parents but my opinion is that they should have at least one parent egyptian and the other another race mm hmm because if one parent s egyptian like the child or the becoming president would have a something of concerns and would know some parts of egypt and its government and if the other and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries states okay good job which the legislative process good job i agree with yessenia and jesus because if they re from egypt and their parents are egyptian then they can have some cultural background and they ll know more from people and they ll have connections with the people good good so now what is the result now do you think you re going to change the part i see i ve heard some different opinions here are you going with the change or do you want to keep it as it is i think we should keep it as it is because i mean that s a good thing to have egyptian parents and a background like hilda said a background of culture mm hmm so i ll say yes leave it just leave it the same okay just that part okay very good so you will just leave that part as it is without change is there any other parts for this article yeah there s a second part his age must not be less than 40 gregorian years mm hmm um i disagree because um when you re young you ll know more about technology and computers and everything mm hmm and that s how um the youth and younger children in egypt that s how they went and communicate i agree with yessenia a lot because when a president is younger but not old he can connect with the youth and other younger people because when egypt was in the revolution the president was 81 years old mm hmm mm hmm eighty four and behind the revolution was the young and they were like younger so he didn t really understand them really well and they didn t understand him well because he was a little older than them so for me i ll say 35 um yeah that s a good age for the president they can connect with teenagers and people of younger i just very good i like the connection that you made jesus between the age and the people who were behind the revolution good job i disagree with jessie and jesus good yeah because i think that part of the constitution is okay because 40 um 40 years is makes them have plenty of experience and to doing his their work and like it makes them like for like what jesus said about technology they can learn about it and they can show them and all so basically they they ll pretty much know who do you mean by they the becoming president that the old or the young the old the older one he cannot understand or work with technology that much yeah because jesus said that they um they won t know about technology much mm hmm but they if they re 40 they would have plenty of experience mm hmm and they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens you know okay good good i agree with emi but i agree with jesus and yessenia so mm hm that s okay um because focus on what you want to do like youth was like 70 or 80 of egypt oh good but if he s older he s going to have more responsibilities mm hmm and he can be more responsible mm hm so i disagree with hilda responsibility because when they re younger they re more active and more responsible like they can remember most things where they keep stuff and when they re active they can like travel through egypt and see what s wrong with the country and what s wrong with the economy and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country so i ll say the younger but not too young like 35 and up thank you my opinion is that 40 is okay because the young the young people like at 35 because 35 s not that young but lower than that can make a little bit of difficulties because they make they might make like a mistake they might not know a thing and they just put another thing you mean they will not be mature enough yeah mature sure good like the 40s the 40 year old people like they they pretty much know everything they learn it they were educated the government laws and mm hmm this and that mm hmm but i think that part is 40 years is better good so you would like to say okay just to open or or or break it down to so young like 30 or 20 or even teenager right well i like that the two parts that you brought hilda about 70 that the majority of the population of egypt are already youth and your part that you said that this will make jesus that that will make help them to have good connection with the young people there good job so what did you decide on i see that you re going with certain direction we should change it the first part of the statement of art 75 mm hmm which is the constitution we should keep that as it is and the second part of the 40 years we should change it well we should leave it like that as well very good i like how you are compromising with them emi and you are going with the change so what part are you going to change um it will be transforming to what thirty five mm hmm thirty five years not less than 35 not less good job excellent very good after you take your notes let s move to the next article article 77 the term of the presidency shall be gregorian six gregorian years starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the mm hmm the president of the republic may be re elected for other successful years mm hmm i disagree with the six years um yes mm hmm yes keep going because i think it s a little longer and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president um having them over again and i think it should be lower for four years like in america and some of the disadvantages are that people could like him and he might be re elected for another six more years um people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country and that s what i think of for the first one what do you all think about it you think the first one should be as it is or changed changed to four years changed to four years yeah okay what do you think i agree i agree with jesus because an example of this is hosni mubarak he he um was following supposedly the terms of the constitution which which he made an excuse and took many chances in um having the presidency so i for like 30 years so i my opinion is to lower it down to four years and if they re re elected which they can use democracy like here in america mm hmm if they re re elected they will have at least 12 years basically okay do you disagree um the statement i agree because it will give them more stability and more time to elect mm hmm i agree with jesus and emi why do you agree with them because six years is a lot of years and if they don t like him they ll have to wait a lot a long time so that another president can come into power okay so you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years yes okay the second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years the thing i dislike about this is that they don t really explain how um the terms for example the president of egypt um used an excuse to be re elected because um he said that in the constitution it said it didn t say specifically how much how many terms um they lead so i ll i ll change that that um leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected um very good point luis i didn t um jesus i m sorry very good point here you brought really a very important point and this is what will this was like the concern of many people over there the specification of of what successful terms of the how many terms very good successive terms very good does anybody have an opinion or disagreement uh i i agree with okay i agree with um you because that s what hosni mubarak was really he was making excuse to like stay um him how like it is to keep him as a president and re elect him over and over to um and he was telling them that he was following the constitution because their theory said there was like no number of yeah so he i agree also because like you said the example of hosni mubarak was the serious serious excuse they um the people were basically mad at them that um certain term because they didn t give a number of the terms so um that s why hosni mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over very good when the point of staying too many years in power or in office that brings to me something that s going on in other two countries you remember any of the other countries in the middle east and africa that has something going on there because of this specific part libya and yemen what s going on in libya now they re protesting against um gaddafi very good yes good job i like how you remembered his name why why they are protesting against him because he d been in power for like about 43 years good job mm hmm okay what else is going on in another country or what country is having something going on yemen yemen yemen very good okay well this brings us to go back again a little further something about different types of governments remember egypt was a republic okay when their the president stayed there for so many years that will not be a republic country that will be what a dictatorship a dictatorship very good that will be a dictatorship so the the the type of government is if government is not a the republic or maybe democracy as they say or claim but it will be it will be a dicta a dictatorship very good and the people in power the people in the office government office will be what dictators okay it s because they do what they want to do and they don t listen to other people okay and what is another name for dictatorship or very close to it,0.0

using two bars ready set and here we go uh oh what are we not supposed to end the question over dawn f f this time you may use your whole instrument for the question you have to start on f but don t end on f ready set and get question here we go good didn t hear anybody end on f i did make your x for a second i heard some people s questions that maybe sounded like this i don t really remember what notes i played i was just kinda doing whatever i wanted to up and down up and down could i sing that no valentine valentine probably not but if my question sounded like this could i sing that probably did i use some patterns in that like a good musician i did valentines valentines pink red and blue okay try it you don t have to do the same thing i did but let s do some repeated notes let s use some patterns and let s not be all up and down our instrument ready set and here you go not bad let s try the answer boys and girls start at any note you want but end on n and let s make it memorable and singable something you can remember something you can sing i made a pretty one just for you ready set and here you go not bad not bad here s what i would like to have happened i m going to ask the question tyler s going to give the answer i m going to ask the question amanda s going give an answer i m gonna ask the question answer question answer question answer question answer and then the next row we re going to switch paige question me answer kia question me answer you get it okay yay shh paige would you mind before we begin arrowing over to the last slide i want to show you what i am looking for yeah go for it when you are doing yeah keep going when you are doing your question or when you are keep going sorry keep going that s it okay here s what i m looking for are you alternating your mallets are you bouncing your mallets are you doing the correct rhythm did your question start on doe if you re the question did your answer end on doe if you re the answer was your melody memorable and singable here we go my turn first so we ll go question answer down the batch feels and you get it todd i forget the i made this pretty one just for you paige question is ready here you go do i start this time yeah you start this time yeah you re going to do the question now i m giving you the answer now question answer question answer let s actually do this question answer question answer question answer ready britney josh you get ready to do the answer ready britney here she goes oh you know what ben it sounded like the end was ended on a doe oh yeah all right you want to try it again that s why eli was like oh yeah okay ready go good sabrina go it s um question okay nice job now some of you didn t get a chance to do the question or didn t get a chance to do the answer right so here s what i m going to have you do and we have 30 seconds to do this with the person next to you one of you do the question one of you do the answer okay let s try it together ready set and here we go answer nice here s the beauty of the pentatonic scale boys and girls no matter if we re doing a million different things at the same time if we re all on different bars the notes of the pentatonic scale sound so good together that you can could be playing something else and it still sounds musical,0.0
so what about this part is this any different or is this part the same as last time it s different because well let s let rileen talk chris it s different because it s wider and it got right to here and the other one came up to there it s like six more it s like ten more centimeters than last time okay so once you guys finish with your observations you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta see this part is completely dry it s pretty much almost half water s above the side watch that watch that it s gonna fall look at that it s like a boat going down a waterfall that was sand i know the water has stopped going one minute s passed thirty oh there s a start to get ready it s not done playing it s still not done well the water look at this look at this i know we re still dry there s a pool of water at the end there s a pool of water at the end look at this there s a dent there s a dent oh wow right here s dry okay why do you guys think this part didn t get any water because it probably went under so cameron says it went under xander what were you saying it was going too fast and it didn t it was probably right here so it didn t decide to go all the way over here and it went right here it formed a lake right here it went the easiest route so it s got eight or nine minutes so now ten nine minutes is water still draining yeah the water s still there when are you guys gonna decide when the end time is when this goes there s been nine minutes right and the water is dripping last time we got 15 minutes the water s dripping into basin last time we got 15 minutes so how does it all compare because um it compares because it s almost the same and look at it like poured a pool or something cameron you were saying this one is almost the same like it took the same amount of time no no no i m saying it s getting there no the other one s longer because it drained a bigger whole yeah so elondra how was the time different for this one how it was like similar let s hear what elondra says this one went faster this one went faster yeah way faster so you re saying it s similar not too different but elondra s saying it went faster do you agree with her yeah and the deposition it s like way over here way across there you guys are i think pretty much done with your water draining now okay so nine or ten minutes and it s done so you guys want to record your end time no no it s still going it s okay if there s still a little bit of water left in once it stops draining you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements where do we get the toothpicks don t we have to know what time it is 10 30 right was this when the chocolate melts when s the chocolate melt elondra what it looks like chocolate so are you guys ready to start taking your measurements yeah why don t you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you and i ll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing yeah i think the widest part is right here can i do the poking huh can i do the poking you guys have your measuring tape out we have to go get the measuring tape tape that back up here our widest part is right here widest part is that no no no you re not supposed to poke it how long is that it s about to here okay we got what we need go from centimeters centimeters aw cameron cameron you messed it up that s not our longest part our longest part is this okay we have to redo it wait where does we start right here here you do the poking don t poke it into the thing but how deep is it here grab it no you re not supposed to do that remember what she did okay this right here it s about three centimeters three centimeters so depth of straight channel is three centimeters okay what do we measure next okay time to do the width how much was it three centimeters three okay what s the widest where s the measuring tape around six centimeters how much six six centimeters six okay now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel it s all this it s all from right here it s from here to here you guys we need the tape measure yeah width from here to here no it s this long i ve got it with my fingers this long it s about 15 no it s 14 and a half no that s 15 yeah 15 oh yeah 15 same with the other one 15 it goes all the way to the end yeah length okay 29 how many 29 yeah and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel where s the toothpick so right here right there yeah okay where s the time okay so can you hold that there how much is it five centimeters how many five five c m okay width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel so right here we re gonna actually move to here no no width oh width looks about 11 centimeters maybe 11 centimeters alright length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel so now we re measuring that here you can do it so what re you guys working on measuring now length we ve got a long length 27 28 28 yeah 28 centimeters jorge you can measure now what do we measure depth of soil dropped at end of the wait what was it 28 depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel where s the toothpick i m letting jorge do it okay jorge you can do this one so maybe poke it here poke it in there now put your finger down put your finger down where it is slide it down until you feel the dirt good bring it over to kendra so you can kinda see the dirt right there that s not even a centimeter you start here okay that s not even a centimeter that s three millimeters so we round it down to zero centimeters okay zero okay we re all done no we still have to work on your bird s eye view picture in your notebook up in the big can oh no they re over there okay the same bird s eye view or a different view that s what i was going to i m especially gonna draw in here because that s really interesting really interesting did cody just go get something yes he did oh my gosh he s so nice so did you guys finish taking your data yeah we re gonna do our bird s eye view before you guys look at your bird s eye view i want you to share what d you guys find from your data so let s look at your data tables for a minute okay it kind of made like a cave no right here yeah so i see the difference right here in the depth of the stream channel the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river what was more like in centimeters so one centimeter off so alejandro s looking at the depth of the stream channel and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep so last time it was actually deeper how about which one was wider the rushing river so the rushing river made a wider stream channel yeah i think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in it basically didn t spend enough time going in it basically just went yeah and it made it more curved inish and stuff okay jorge what d you notice i noticed that right here it made a little cave and i think something like water i think there was a little whirlpool there yeah there was there were a bunch of whirlpools yeah there were doubles there s one right here and here so i think it broke the water i saw one little whirlpool right there and another one over here i saw one here so the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places yeah i think it s cause it curves like that so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water s coming through yeah so the water s so what about the delta the deposition how is this different than your first experiment oh my gosh it was five centimeters bigger five centimeters bigger what d you notice jorge the biggest part was that it was only this part right here okay yeah that was the longest part that was part of it all so cody i noticed that this time how deep was your delta our delta which would be to get that soil yeah zero centimeters so does that mean there s no delta so how did you guys come up with zero cause it was three millimeters so we had to round down okay so you guys have your data and the length of the soil it was a lot wider wasn t it yeah the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger it was from the end right here and it continued down so you guys remember we re gonna take this data someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here oh put more of the earth material in yeah and see what it would be like if you added more material okay maybe that would be a question we could investigate maybe the delta would be thicker because there s not enough room for all of it you know why i m asking you that because i think it would be deeper because right here it only makes little ones here but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space okay so you think these channels might be bigger yeah if there was more earth material what if we made an even bigger hole oh so you re wondering if it was an even bigger flood what might happen maybe that would be a hole like this big yeah you guys are doing that thing that scientists do after they do an investigation they start asking more questions i wonder what if we tried this so you guys have got your data so we ll be ready to put this in the class data table right find our averages probably on thursday right now you guys are going to be working on you want to make sure you get the runoff sample draw what that looks like today we ll see what it looks like when it settles out later and then you guys are going to work on your bird s eye view and think about where s the humus where s the gravel where s the clay so you can add that into the picture hey guys i m gonna like yeah i was thinking the same thing like rip this up whoa there s the biggest oh that s cool ms maher it made a big dip i m guessing that some water s still down there,0.0
most friends have finished their first trials i wanted to talk real quick about what s happened on your first trial who wants to share what happened on your first three trials and i want to know was it something that you predicted would happen cody at first we kinda got a little it kind of got a little complicated since you came around it fixed it a little why was it complicated cause the rest of the group didn t see your experiment why was it complicated because it keep turning and the wax paper was what kept turning the car your car kept turning yeah and the wax paper kept coming off and turning it so it was a little complicated so after you got it fixed and after i helped you then what did you find out that it was kind of easy to do so did your measurement did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be when it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance we thought it was gonna i thought it was gonna go very far because that s a little bit slicker because that it s slippery well i was listening to another group talk about something i think it was at bhavana s group raise your hand if you re in bhavana s group and really deep had really good observation because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too but you told me something about the surface that we were testing on i said the the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough so do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we re testing on being rough if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car s going to travel give me a thumb s up i think that makes a difference lucy why do you think it makes a difference the carpet there s a feel of bumps if you could feel it and the wax paper is slippery so that s how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast like if they have wheels or something it makes stuff fast that s true so as we get ready for our next test you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial but i want you to predict now that you ve kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel looking at your information your measurements i want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface and we re choosing to use the shelf liner today the black shelf liner in your tub do you think the car s going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial we may only get through one trial and that is okay alright but i want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start so lawson what are you gonna do first before you test get in a group meeting and sit down and meet yeah and talk about your predictions first that s what good scientists do they re always making really good predictions about what they ve observed alright go i m setting the timer i think it will go really bumpy well not really bumpy but a little bumpy and it might go just a little less than the smooth i think that it will go slower because the surface it s really bumpy and one time i went on this bumpy slide and i did not go down very quickly don t worry about recording the information right now but we ll record in a little bit i think they re gonna go a little bit far i bet slower hey you can t pick off of me i think that it s gonna go farther and faster i think it s gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster i think it s gonna go a little bit slower i think it s kind of gonna go since it s bumpy it s gonna slow it down i think it was gonna go farther group meeting s over so you think it s gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper no i think it s going a little bit slower but still a little fast like medium so you don t think it s gonna change that much why do you think that cause it doesn t feel too too bumpy it doesn t feel too too bumpy she s making a really good observation what do you think jaylin my predict is when you put the car on it it s gonna kinda go medium it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast and then when it gets to the carpet it s gonna go slower and then it s gonna turn it s gonna go a lot slower and then it s going to turn i think like that fast okay not too fast not as fast as the wax paper go ahead and test but let s think about your setup here before you move this let s look at your setup as the car rolls what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug what might happen it might get stopped remember the car s going to continue to move until something makes it stop so what might you want to do with your ramp we might want it to be here so it will go straighter but it might bump into the black box it may well you know the rug is going to i don t mean there but i mean i know what we could do we could do it this way so it won t crash well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way javier could you go get us some tape it may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape try it and see let s try it without some yeah it doesn t even need tape who s the task manager here me look out he s doing the first test i think it should be jaylin okay jaylin now do you test sideways we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn t agree and you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same javier can you move out of the way you ready now wait a minute wait a minute cause i bet you probably got his on tape jaylin show me how you did that again go get the car watch what he did with his popsicle stick cause i hadn t seen that before do it just like you did the first time what did he do with his popsicle stick he flipped it down do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up why might it make a difference olivia because it might when you put it down you re putting it down fast and i bet it makes the car go a little bit faster and it gives it some force did it give it more force so jaylin is this surface the same as this surface is this the same as this yes i think is this popsicle stick the same as this here no so if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy no so what do you need to do with the popsicle stick raise it up you might want to raise it up next time alright try it again i ll come back and see if you guys are ready one two and go wow that was great now let s start measuring now we re gonna start measuring okay okay one two no tessa s gotta do that one two three ready oh my gosh we were right our first prediction is one two three four five six seven eight it s eight oh my gosh why s it eight and ours keeps getting a mess up i predicted eight too see i predicted seven mostly we got eight cubes on this one eight cubes really before we clean up i would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting i m gonna come around and be watching quick quick quick it s almost time for us to go about what you learned what you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used the shelf liner what did you learn from what you tested i learned that the bumpy surface made it go that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster how do you know that because when we use the smooth it went further how far did it go it went about eight cubes no i think it actually went seven i don t know we didn t put the lines behind it 36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes so that makes it the point where bumpy is slower so 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy the shelf liner i think it was seven on the bumpy big difference isn t it is that what you predicted no i didn t predict eight i predicted 16 no i didn t predict on the bumpy but i predicted i predicted one and i got the right answer for it on smooth alright well you guys have two more trials to do so we ll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three alright go ahead and get cleaned up we already cleaned most of them first well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub you can go ahead and record your data but we re gonna get cleaned up go ahead and get cleaned up alright push the red button you can push the red button mary come over here tell us what you learned okay mary come over here i learned that different surfaces can make something different whatever you re testing make it go fast and slow mary what did you learn i learned mostly the same thing except when we did that you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet it makes this go faster than the carpet which makes a difference yeah jaylin what did you learn i learned if you put the car on this it s gonna go a little bit faster if you put it on this it s gonna go a little bit almost fast and it s gonna stop and go slower and that s why it went right there okay does anybody have anything else javier what did you learn well i learned that if it s smoother it s quicker but if it s a little bumpy it s slower that s it alright everyone put your things in the bucket,0.0
like compared to osteoblasts the osteoclasts to be more efficient and work harder than the osteoclasts therefore you re more than you are building so that ratio can cause brittle bones so what okay right yeah one s up one goes down yeah if you re taking away more than you re putting back no i m sorry why don t osteo cause there s a lack of estrogen and or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work we kind of hit on that a little i don t know i kinda did but i kinda didn t what causes osteoblasts to work that it okay so when they re saying that the osteoclasts are working more what they re not saying more than they used to work they re saying more compared to the osteoblasts okay it s not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity they re just doing what they do it s just because the blast activity dropped which you guys got that the blast activity dropped why did that blast activity drop because there weren t enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting good is everybody get that cause see now the blast activity s what s really dropping and the clast activity keeps going like it normally goes but relative to one another you have more clast activity less blast activity and therefore you re losing bone everybody got that idea okay good you did a good job reasoning that out okay you can keep going matt okay our next question kind of gets off of like the description of osteoblasts and it says how can osteoblasts or how can osteoporosis be prevented brooke well they recommend having like a good number a good amount of calcium intake a day about 1 000 1 500 milligrams you could do that something simple like that could prevent like osteoporosis in the long run all right i would also suggest regular exercise in order to kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise so that there s less there s more bone actually broken down basically a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk along with everything else there s a i went to the food and drug administration you can have zoledronic acid which can be injected every two years for like prevention along with the diet and exercise anybody else have anything they d like to add i was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other nobody else okay now who s on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed yeah i found the most current one is a form called dual energy x ray reabsorption test to test the bone density you get a score of either one or below means you re normal one to 2 5 is osteoporosis 2 5 and above it s just your bones are gonna break any time all right anybody else there s just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density so there s like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative that s what they use cause it s like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not so you kinda need more ways to test good you can also take a sample of your and analyze it to see if there s any signs of erosion or anything that ll lead to osteoporosis okay what s that called anybody know what that s called what is it bioscan good before you even go to the doctor like it s really hard to diag like there s not really symptoms of it but some of the symptoms are like bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that and breaking bones with little or no trauma what do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma what kind of fracture traumatic traumatic would be if it was kind of trauma pathological good job yeah pathological fracture that would be a pathological fracture if there s a disease under there like osteoporosis which has made it weak enough to break good call so somebody mentioned the scanner zach right you talked about that the abbreviated what did what was the full name of that scan again dual energy x ray absorption okay has anyone ever heard of a dex scan dexa scanner that s where the d e x comes from dual energy x ray dexa scan and that s very common yeah is that like what the guy from pursuit of happiness yeah i don t know if you ever saw that movie i didn t yeah the bone density scanner i didn t know if that was it yeah okay so how did they what the general how they actually what bones do they look at in the scanner i think it was the wrist the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis the lumbar part of your spine because that s the first to go why what else is important to consider if you if you think about the type of bone being affected what type of bone being affected what type of bone i should remember trabeculae yeah so that s a spongy bone right so trabeculae of the spongy bone why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now it s a spongy bone yeah it s an irregular shaped bone but the body of the vertebrae is basically a cortex in and it s a spongy bone in there it s all trabeculae what was the other bones that you said madhura wrist and hip okay so hip as in what do you mean by that do you think robert ilium ilium it s all a spongy bone a spongy bone in the ilium good place to look for it but here s the thing what about the wrist how come think from a practical scenario how come the wrist yeah lexi i think it s cause you use it like so often that they is probably the most common because you use your wrist for like basically do you use it a lot another possible reason yeah kevin because it s a lot of like small bones so they may be easier to break or like be more fragile okay that s a possibility mikey i would say cause it s easy to get to like it s pretty hard to take like and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip it s kinda hard to get like a good angle but like your wrist can there s not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture okay thank you for that that s exactly why they use the wrist i mean the wrist bones when you think about em you know they re not weight bearing so they re probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones but they do have spongy bone in them they re little irregular shaped bones which have a cortex with some spongy bone so there is some material in there to evaluate but you don t have to disrobe you don t have to do anything you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what s called a screening a screening test has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before or thought of ever heard of screening tests being done for other things no not familiar with the screening tests i think i ve had one have you yeah because if i had like it wasn t for bones though it could be for anything like they were looking for appendicitis but they couldn t find it so they were doing other all these other kinds of tests i don t know if that well a screening test it could be it could be a screening test screening tests are basically more generalized testing not the most specific but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation okay so if you put your arm in the scanner and it was towards the low end it s not the best for making an end all you know quantitative diagnosis but it s a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium you see so that s why the arm so it s interesting that you brought that up that was really good cause it really helps us look at the whole where is this occurring and why do they use those specific bones okay matt anything else there our next question we have already said how it s diagnosed we know what it is so how can we treat osteoporosis well i said i found online that there were really no treatments like true treatments for osteoporosis it s more of trying to prevent it by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before because you can t really treat it once it s gone well that s funny i found something a little different there s a few medicines right now like talking about you ve seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it now they re actually saying like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you ve lost from the bones but it s also something kind of funny i saw if the bones start to become more dense they also found that like around your jaw starts to deteriorate faster some reason actually get like sore throat so i was wondering if anyone try to reason that out because i could not figure out why just your jaw starts losing calcium but your long bones start gaining it are you saying that they re taking medication and then they re experiencing pain so that yeah like the calcium to deteriorate but like your long bones it s like your limbs and everything start to become more dense is your jaw a lot of is it one of those bones yeah some but there isn t a whole lot in there there is some is it a more compact bone probably a more compact bone in your jaw there isn t a lot of cavity space or spongy bone space there maybe that has something to do with that even having a sore throat i don t know why that would affect it at all maybe because it s a horrible medicine i don t know like the thyroid gland like this one or the parathyroid this is like calcium like bone absorption so maybe i don t know it s not working as efficiently so it s not getting the through to the jawbone or maybe it s working too much or something maybe since your jaw is losing calcium and it s kinda gaining like losing its calcium so it s probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis your hyoid bone isn t your hyoid bone isn t it sort of high it doesn t really touch any other bones but it s kinda in there so it s kinda in your throat so that could be like i don t know it s kinda unusual just answer this one with the general area cause there s a lot of instances where you couldn t sit or lay down for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus so i don t know there were a lot of really bad side effects just well what i was wondering i kinda see like some doctors like just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention would be the other side to treatment just go do like those lifestyle changes instead of like thinking oh i ll wait until these signs come up and have platelet scans and i ll take medicine just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don t drink excessively and like have those good workout regimens so you prevent it rather than treat it yeah seems like a disease that s either prevented or managed not so much treated but i thought i think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids for like asthma like in your inhaler so it s something that inhibits bone breakdown so it doesn t sound like it treats it but it kind of manages it so you don t break bones yeah did anyone request a name a name brand fosamax did we see that yeah did they tell you how it worked no actually no well fosamax is like did you see something there zach yeah wasn t that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo osteo something bone reabsorption so they re inhibiting which cells osteoclasts okay yeah so that s how fosamax and those work they inhibit the osteoclasts so they re not building bone though you see the difference yeah they re not really building the bone they re stopping the erosion it s a little different but if you have like dead bone or old bone that needs to be replaced wouldn t that just inhibit it just as much because there s still old calcium sitting in your leg that i don t know whenever there s waste in your body that doesn t get dealt with i mean like when you have an appendectomy and there s waste in your appendix that like it can kill you if there s like waste in your body so maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis not so much as help it in the long run i m thinking cause any time you re keeping like something that s old in your body that s not good like you eat something you have to like you have to digest it and i don t know yeah it s a good thought process good thought process so that s what fosamax works that way so if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps let s say someone who has osteoporosis let s assume they have it now what types of mechanisms in other words what types of things will we try and get a drug to do what would we want it to do you want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better and someone already mentioned this but they had like estrogen supplements like supposedly like help out with that maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability okay well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement did anyone request that as a therapy yeah kevin and there s like these like it s like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches where you can take it as a pill so it adds estrogen to your body so it balances out your loss of estrogen and raises it yeah there s like he was talking about the hormone replacement but i also read on google health that it s rarely used and it s not used twice with women i don t know if that has anything to do with it i can google it i guess like if you use the treatment once any ideas why anybody find out why estrogen replacement they used to you know what they used to give estrogen like they give vitamins it used to be prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen seriously and it wasn t all that long ago how come it isn t get because then your body stops producing its like natural estrogen so good idea maybe any other poss nick any idea you can think of i don t know you re not producing enough so because you re not we should get more well how come have anybody heard of anything that s related to estrogen therapy bad things facial hair growth well testosterone can increase facial hair growth someone else over here cancer cancer and that s the problem they saw incidences of particularly breast cancer went up substantially and so that s why artie they re saying that you know hormone replacement it s still being used it s rarely used yeah but not like it used to be not like it used to be so if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly or blasts to work properly then shouldn t you like have like some sort of treatment to like make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts we would have like sort of a difference in their relationship good idea but isn t that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone so shouldn t we find a way to like make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they re stimulated but they have to be stimulated so show me if you re looking for a way to stimulate them more than make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes no that would be more like a genetic thing cause your osteocytes your dna is like breaking down as you get older so it s like not it s like i don t know is it mutating when it gets older i don t know a lot about genetics but i know your dna kinda breaks down as you get older and so that makes your cells not as efficient so it might be more of a dna kinda thing where you have to engineer that dna wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you re like 78 as when you re 12 so it might be in like that area but i don t know a lot about that so yeah it s interesting where you can go with it all right you can take this because even artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat what were you saying about that i don t know maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland i don t know maybe it like produced too much i don t know the jaw bone and it reached the jawbone first and i thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to the rest of the body so which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines maybe that s why your jaw s if you release a lot of that hormone then it s building your jaw up and when you re building bone you get growing pains maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw maybe,0.0
hello guys after all the hard work you ve put in on doing your presentations and your tri board and all the really cool stuff you ve done now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you ve done all this research for okay so first off doing a little poll which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use solar energy why it looks pretty cool and i don t know it seems like the most efficient way because the sun s always there and the sun won t run out that s the word whenever you re done using it you can sell it you can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night you can sell it okay so he thinks solar who else okay go ahead i like the wind oh so you can talk to him because you want to be able to talk to each other right i liked the wind one because it stored up the battery and the battery whenever it wasn t windy and so it kind of was always there it didn t matter about the wind yeah you can answer the question i also think that wind s the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind you can also make money off of that so maybe if you get it in enough homes you won t even have to have a job you can make money off that that s a very good point that s a very good point making money off of that energy source which other ones did we say could make money um the solar solar can make money well i like the wind because it s like the sun is going to burn up one day but the wind is always going to be there and the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die but that s okay okay well what are some pros and cons then so you just said birds would die if we use wind power okay does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power i think birds dying isn t that bad because you know we eat birds so i don t think it would be that bad if birds do die i mean i don t think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy not as much as oil or any of that other stuff yeah or like we eat birds the other one i like is the hydro one that james did because his was ridiculous that was nice so what part of it were you most impressed with like not like the demonstration but it was a great demonstration but hydroelectric power in general what part of that like how if you have a pond or something you can put it in there and then it will power up your whole house do we need moving water oh yeah you need moving water to have that you d have to have a stream but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water and if you really wanted to spend some money there s also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir so that one actually sounds pretty good so somebody want to defend theirs rakif i don t really like mine because which one did you do i did oil natural gas oil and natural gas okay why not because mine isn t as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy so it s probably going to run out pretty soon like oil natural gas and coal do run out they re not going to be as here as much as the wind or hydro or something like that well there s a lot of dangers involved with using oil right oil rigs pipelines lots of dangers involved right oil prices can cause high gas prices that s true too remember in your presentation you talk about some of the dangers what were those dangers and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources for oil yeah the pipelines can burst and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out they could cause another oil spill explosions but coal i know you re supposed to like stick up for your natural resource but i kind of think coal can be good but it s mostly bad because a lot of people s lives are getting killed because of all the gasses smells and being down there for so long and i think that s also very bad and the land it hurts the land and the environment coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it all the coal dust it can cause a lot of lung problems so the miners that go down there they re risking their lives right yeah any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal no nuclear energy what nuclear energy is the worst okay what about nuclear energy how dangerous was that when you looked it up it s a six out of ten chance of what happening it depends it costs way too much first of all to build it it is very expensive that s true it s got a lot of risks like if it gets into your water or if you breathe in the radiation i imagine it could it smells bad okay does collecting oil use more energy than it provides good question what do you mean by collecting oil like if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil does it use more energy than it provides no i don t think so because in my presentation it said it produces like a widespread like a very large amount of energy and also that your wave and tidal power powers our system as you said in your presentation oh good point those two actually work together when you talk about the wave and tidal power that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling so that s a very good thing as well it s a benefit of drilling absolutely are there different energies that do benefit each other yes the solar energy and wind because the wind energy is based off the sun because of how the sun waves come onto the earth and then it turns this sun mill so it produces the turning of the mill so the sun and solar energy and wind energy the solar energy and the wind they actually work together because i ve seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top one then the other can go that s okay i think solar energy is a really good thing because for a lot of power plants like for times the condition of natural resources like wind even hydroelectric if there s a drought or something or not enough water flow you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant or anywhere right because we ve found that solar is pretty cost feasible right yeah it s not that expensive and actually you won t have to pay an electrical bill if you get that if you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something you re better off just using the solar panel it would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine or to have the solar panels power the turbine it doesn t power it it s just like another way to get energy at the same time that you re getting the wind when there s no wind there s not much of a wind that s what the battery s for hmm interesting i have a question for solar power too for solar power how can i make aluminum more efficient in the future well it doesn t use a lot of the gas so it doesn t affect the environment so it doesn t affect your breathing and you don t need solar panels like you don t need to turn stuff on during the day because the sun through the windows can give you light and then can store up for the night okay i have a question what natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future like 50 or so years from now wind it was used like 3 000 years ago so if it was used 3 000 years ago i think it would be used 3 000 years in the future that s not necessarily true because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes the problem with the wind thing is it can be used in country like rural areas because in other areas you can t put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood because you can t can you put one you mean i could put one outside the school here well it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school well i d put it on top of the school because then there would be more wind higher up right and we have to worry about spacing right because we were saying wind power is built usually where on wind farms where you have a lot of flat land because if you build in a mountainous region are you going to get a lot of the wind if it s high enough it ll probably be enough then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning or being damaged that way yeah that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down right that s very possible so when you think about one energy source is there really one energy source to go with or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live what s available because again talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water is there running water everywhere around the united states no no and what s the problem if you flood an area even if there is a running water what happens if you flood the area well they have to decide usually if it s going to be a major problem they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things that s mostly our united states rule but in china they really don t care so they flood three or four cities multiple towns fill up three gorges of water wow that s just insane because once you disrupt water flow you have a problem so again there are some pros and cons to these okay we re going to take a second and we re going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use so if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with whether there was running water think you have those things beside you don t limit yourself there but turn to your neighbor for a minute and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2 because each one of you might have a different opinion give each other a little bit of a reason why and we ll get back together in just a second alright guys another 30 seconds then we ll get back together alright three two one let s wrap up our conversations alright how many people by show of hands went with one of the non renewable resources like coal oil or natural gas cool so everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go alright ryan i think it s either wind or solar power how many people agree oh so wind or solar is the clear choice jonah why the thing is i think solar would be first because solar energy you can use almost anywhere pretty much but the wind if you live here you can t get it as easily because there s not as much wind so it would be a lot easier to have solar because you can use solar anywhere because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere we think solar too because the sun is always there even if it is winter or it s a little cloudy the sun is still there yeah but what about at night time so maddy what did we find out about solar at night time like a lot of people go to work during the day so no one s at their house using their lights and stuff so there s a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house you still get some light at night bouncing off the moon dustin what do you think i was thinking that solar energy would be great because i was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone and you have it plugged in and while it s plugged in it s fully charged and you can still use it and it won t un charge because it s still plugged into the wall but if the power goes out at your house then it will stop charging and you ll have that much battery left so it s kind of like if you re out in the day and your house is charging while there s still sun so you re still getting energy and at night time when the sun is gone you ll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing well it s the same thing with wind power you d still have that battery there yeah wind power would be would solar power still work during a storm it depends how severe the storm is so you mean this is like built to last yeah if it gets struck by lightning i don t think it would still work but you know when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds right so that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day just at night you would still have to use the battery that s been stored just like with wind power there is wind power all day long all night long but sometimes it does die down at certain times so there s a battery too there as well exactly i agree with solar power but i agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things but i don t see the purpose of a solar farm it takes up a lot of land just the point to collect the sun i think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant like wind power or something like that because and cost wise it would be probably expensive because it was 900 for just one of those panels and miss shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house that s basically about 10 800 for one house but we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines just imagine random winter lines in your front yard yeah but we saw pictures or a video of a solar powered house and most people don t like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house same with the wind power wind turbines would look unattractive but you can still decorate them if you want you can t really do that with the wind power i mean solar power thing because it s mostly black that s a good thought so going forward thinking of an energy solution because as you guys get older energy is going to be something you have to worry about we ve seen the gas prices the gasoline prices for regular cars go up you ve seen the ethanol being developed is it good to keep developing new technologies how many of you guys once you start driving think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you would drive a hybrid car i would okay would you drive a hybrid car yeah i would drive one because it s more in miles per gallon and with rechargeable cars you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money that s good also the emissions from your gas,0.0
consider what you read about organic lettuce and rosie from omnivore s dilemma and from what you re reading do you feel it s worth the extra cost and effort to eat organic yes so for some organics i believe it is worth it and others i don t industrial organic i don t believe it s worth it because for the lettuce in the book omnivore s dilemma they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce and i don t believe that s energy efficient at all but other farms other industries or other organic farms like polyface farms they use all natural energy not a lot of fossil fuels go into it and i think it s more efficient so organic like that i believe is better but industrial organic i don t believe is better that s a good point i was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic phil if you want to pick someone eli so normal organic food like what started the idea of organic food was completely different from organic food that you buy at whole foods nowadays like what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local sustainable farm like polyface farms where it s completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals but industrial organic systems it s pretty much the same as normal industrial food system except they don t use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food they still have animal rights there s still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories and stuff like that araceli i agree with eli because when i read organic i thought organic was good but then basically it was the same thing like the chickens they still got fed corn but they had an open door but they were so fat they couldn t go through like why pay the extra money for something that s going to be exactly the same as the other thing i think it is worth buying organic food because even though the animals are treated the same and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel we save a lot of farmland from being put like pesticide and everything on it so we could have chemical free land and also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use so it might cost a little bit more but it s worth it matt in response to i guess eli it s not exactly the same there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones but yes i can definitely agree that it s a very similar thing it doesn t solve all the problems with the industrial system i don t agree with what was just said that when you farm without pesticides it s better because in omnivore s dilemma even though they farm without pesticides they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land so it s not necessarily better it just sounds better i just like simone s point because i think that a lot of the problems are still there and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides i think it s still important to eat real organic food i think that would be the best industrial organic is a step in the right direction but i don t think it s close enough to where we should be with our food system i agree with molly that industrial organic foods on the face are both they re worth paying for because they re the food that we should be eating but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution if you want the right type of food you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the united states but still has healthy animals and animals that have evolved to eat only being fed that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the united states like we are fed now i was going to also ask a couple personal questions since i was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change do you think now that you feel like you re more aware or she says that she always bought grass fed beef and i try to eat healthy but in the case of fast food of course i go and eat fast food but lately i ve been badgering her and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak i ve been waiting for that for a long time the corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad so anyway there s nobody asking i don t think organic s really necessarily healthy for us because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need what essentials we still need like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed so how can we tell organic s good for us if we don t know what organic is different from what we get from normal food i thought curt brought a good point up too which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers but it is a great point that curt and greg brings up which is that that way can t feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food i completely agree with that it s implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy we read in the omnivore s dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day that s a lot of land for very little meat and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country lisa so i kind of agree with what you re saying but it doesn t have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic if there s little farms all over the united states then meat can go to those people around there it might not happen all of a sudden but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better whether it s more expensive or not it s healthier for us knowing that the animals when the animals are not fed on natural stuff that in turn is bad for us ashley i agree with what everyone said and that the point that paulina brought up about we re still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what s good for us because i feel like it s more better to spend even just a few more cents if organic food isn t that expensive and go to certain places a few more cents on the local home grown organic food because i used to buy meat from the what s it called the meat section the deli deli yeah there you go and i used to buy meat there and i thought it was all fine you know whatever until i went to the doctor one day because i was getting really injured and she was like you re missing all these vitamins and she gave me all these vitamins to take and i didn t know that that was missing inside my food and then i go to the organic section of the supermarket and it s not even like vitamins that were missing in the meat it s vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food for example like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there just because it s like naturally grown and organic so i was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health so i feel like if people realize how important it is for your health that scare will wake them up and they ll be able to spend the dollar okay well i agree i think that it s worth the extra cost for organic because like in the book it said when we buy organic food we re voting with our forks and we re voting for the type of food we want and if we go organic then the producers will think that most of us want organic so they ll start growing more and selling more organic food so that it might become cheaper in the long run i personally don t really care like if it s cheaper that s cool because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off and animal s rights are nice but they re going to be killed anyway it s like they re all going to die anyway they re going to die so michael i like it and yeah i mean even though organic s good we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income so we might not be like the healthiest nation but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the united states so i kind of like that they don t have to worry about paying high prices for food even though it s bad for my health and even if it is bad i could just exercise so i think it s a personal responsibility to watch what you eat so we should be open to that even with the industrialized food system we re still not feeding everyone if you go to like the appalachians and stuff like that you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don t make enough money to buy even the cheap food so i think that it s not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go i think we need to worry about cost later on and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to lisa i see how you brought up the appalchians but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here where it effects us or would you find it more important to focus like worldwide like you could focus on problems that people have outside but like wouldn t you focus on start here make sure that we have what we need first and then branch out i think that with that like with a lot of people who get stuff locally so if you re saying locally like are you talking like chicago don t you think it s better to start locally and then like we get better locally and then we get better statewide and then we ll go on until everybody has enough money to do this or their food everyone can buy their food i think so but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in illinois that doesn t guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies and i think if we focus on doing something for united states and worry less about the other countries even though politically it might not be the right thing to do worry less about the other countries at this time but i think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing okay how can we make this better on a local level chris i think that we can t really make it perfect like the way polyface farms is because of how the cities are laid out because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there so i think what we have to do is have this industrial organic which still is i mean a lot more worth it because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil and i read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of new jersey was like a dead zone at the end of the mississippi river and the gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down and that s problem that we should focus on well i agree with teresa that we should start only in the us because we can t just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are we only know that the us is eating unhealthy because according to omnivore s dilemma king corn and food incorporated the problems are only occurring in the united states so if we want to solve this problem we should start from the origins because we started using corn massively creating problems and stuff not because of other countries well maybe because we imported corn from mexico and they dominated out other corn types so we started using corn but we should start focusing on more of what s the problem over here instead of other countries because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems maybe yeah i was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic because even if it s just a little bit of farms here and there people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food like in polyface farms people came from hundreds of miles i think or 100 miles just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food and with jerry i wanted to say that well nevermind okay then so i remember gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in america and that s the issue we should be working on but that s really what the food industry does like making the most food possible they pretty much put everything else aside besides mass production they don t really care about animal rights or worker safety or anything like that they just put as much work as they can into making more food and like gabby said people in america still can t afford this food that s cheaper than it s ever been in the past so it just shows that really we can not go back to just normal farms because there s no way just natural farms like polyface could ever sustain a population as big as america like we kind of dug ourselves into a hole yeah okay so what do you think we should do then if we ve dug ourselves if we ve dug ourselves into this hole even though if we re going to be producing less food that s better quality i agree that is better because then you re taking the animal rights into consideration the workers rights and everything but then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat and so people are eating a bigger variety of food or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone because at the end of the day either we re going to have a lot of people who die because we change this and we change it too fast and we re not ready to adapt to it or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives eli okay well i think that we should really just follow the model of like france or some other country in europe or something because they have a way better people in france are so much healthier than people in america and they don t eat nearly as much food they still aren t starving most people in france aren t starving or anything so there are countries it s just not left them okay i don t know if this makes sense but if they have like 20 000 chickens in one pen do they have to feed them corn like what s wrong with mass production but making it a little healthier why can t they just give them something else that s maybe not all corn maybe half corn or half corn to little corn and then metaphorically speaking this totally reminds me of hitler and like how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything and that s like what they re doing with the animals they re just working them to death and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever deja i think the answer to your question is that most people just want money so they ll buy whatever s cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money i think that s the answer to your question about why don t they just choose another food instead of corn i think it s because of money but also consider what about what about the industrial organic doesn t that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed even though they re raised in coops they re still fed corn molly okay so i think that it s a really good idea that matthew brought up a while ago that the industrial issue it can t really be solved by using beyond organic i think we ve moved on from that we can t really go back to beyond organic because we wouldn t be able to feed enough people and then just to adam s point i don t think that we re not producing enough food i think the problem is that the people don t have enough money for the food so i think that producing more food wouldn t really help i was going to say everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody but if you think we actually waste a lot of food too that s actually important i think we saw a picture or something all of it gets thrown out every day or they have ads on it on tv if we re so worried about feeding everyone why don t we eat better ourselves and stop buying so much food we don t actually eat well either whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside i like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea whether it s taking france s ideas and taking it onto ourselves or just ourselves spreading it out because so obnoxious they would go out to mcdonald s my family and be like do you know what that eats and then just start talking we re like shut up don t tell me what it eats i m going to eat it and now my mom asks me she s like is this good and then i read it i m like yeah it has this and this and this and now she turns to me and like asks me should we buy this should we not so i think i have changed a little bit at least having been,0.0
so you can t count it out completely hmm so we have three things going on here i hear exponential decay i hear an upside down parabola and i hear a negative sloping line red why don t you chime in i haven t heard from you are you going with decay are you going with decreasing line you going with upside down parabola what had you guys decided we were going to go with decay but you were going to go with decay okay but i changed my mind because decay it keeps decreasing all the way but myspace it got to a point where it stopped decreasing and it was like what rosetta said so it stopped decreasing which is what you re saying and you re saying that s in agreement with rosetta i have a serious issue with a line stopping can somebody talk to me about that i have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself it s the end of the line slows itself colin i haven t heard from you i don t think it s linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on myspace i agree with elsie that it might be decay because it decreased but decay doesn t ever touch the x axis which would signify there are no users ah and there will always be users oooh what s somebody thing about that really really really significant comment that was just made by colin what do we think the fact that it s never going to how did you say it i said that the linear was going to at one point to hit zero and with decay it s never going to hit zero it s going to get really close but not touch it jeffrey i agree with colin because if it was a negative line like a negative line right you re going to go past zero and you can t have a negative amount of users cause a line keeps on going forever ok does exponential keep going forever no i mean yes yes it does but because it s so small that it never touches the x axis but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero so if we all agree are we getting closer to agreeing that it s exponential decay yes if we are agreeing it s exponential decay then what jeffrey just said what does that mean for myspace the company will it go out of business no based on what jeffrey just said about an exponential decay at the end what does that mean for myspace the company what do you know about myspace the company at this moment it s still low it s still low but is it in existence yes it is do you know what s keeping it you know i think because you re always going to have that one user account ok you might you might always have that one user there s something though that myspace provides that other websites don t that s very easy to do that other sites don t have and this is what s keeping it from touching that x axis do you know what it is alicia talk to us i can t hear you music yes alicia who is in the band would obviously know this right tell them what you do on myspace alicia bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them yeah you can upload your music on myspace easier than any of the other sites very good thank you for chiming in alright let s shift gears from myspace now let s talk twitter twitter twitter twitter what do you think about the growth of twitter alright keywords red start me off with keywords and then we ll bounce to pink and around the room give them your attention ladies and gentlemen are you guys prepared and ready for twitter rush i m sorry rush where show me it s missing something there what s your keyword rush it s in the middle of the sentence in the third sentence oh rush is that what you said ok just speak up i m getting old i can t hear growth continues steadily okay anything else yeah but it s at the tweets this the tweeted yeah it goes with this okay so what do you guys pick for the growth what function models twitter s growth exponential growth you think it s exponential growth as well alright is there a team pink you re up i disagree with that i think it s linear because it says that another keyword that they ve given is with 40 million in may that whole sentence right there got it that s like a slope if you think about it with 40 million in may 2009 6 months later 60 million and then 80 million in may 2010 the slope it would be 20 million so it s linear it s going positive slope hmm filling out those listening labs pink just gave some hard core evidence red do you have a comeback or have they won you over you have a comeback let s hear it lenny what s your comeback this can not be because because it s going to get to a point where it s going to stop it s not like we re going to take it like do you have a time machine ok so let s leave lenny i think exponential growth isn t going to stop and i think a line isn t going to stop right and i think that if we think about the future i think that s what star is maybe trying to do is predict the future we don t really know but from the language here in your text the information you do know i think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope do you agree yes yes anybody else want to chime in on this one that i haven t heard from maybe from elianna on blue bleaker i haven t heard from you carlia yet what do you guys think how bout anything you want to add about twitter anything you want to add greg go ahead well what lenny was saying i cannot beat and i agree with them that s it ok thank you any i agree with star because as you mentioned what this does or hope is that they ll be able to tweet via text messages and that s something that facebook didn t offer so the more things that the more things that twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase ok so as twitter grows you re saying the other networks might be slowed who though is going to outperform it if it s a different type of graph who is going to outperform twitter for sure if twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned facebook right because facebook is what exponential exponential very good ok so let s go now to aim we re doing very well on time here aim who s going to start us off with aim alright pink you can start us off keywords and reasoning talk to me some key words we worked was aol lost their dominance lost their dominance okay yep and then we put continuous fielding is growth today okay and we said that it was quadratic equations because at one point it was really high but then as time went by it started decreasing but then it started getting more popular again lately teenagers liked using it so it started going up again ok is there another keyword up here that would help anybody i think there s at least one more keyword that i haven t seen pointed up elianna is it comeback comeback where s comeback beautiful made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier jermaine thank you sorry say that again dominated dominated very nice jermaine so it started out dominating then had to make a comeback does anybody want to add on to what pink said about this being quadratic which way which way would make it positive from earlier positive what talk to me about the equation now quadratic is always going to do quadratics always go up no go down too parabolic this parabola they always look like this no think about inverses we learned through this year raise your hand and let me know what you want to say talk to me do parabolas always open upwards go ahead i just want to agree with them you agree that it s a parabola yeah because in a parabola it says that it started off dominating but you re on top if you re dominating then it said that it made a comeback that means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back they come back up beautiful wanna add to that go ahead i was just going to say the other end alright so i just want to make sure i answered purple s question in the back you asked which way take a look at this this is what you re talking about could the parabola be like this what would this mean if the parabola were down for the company if it was down then that means it s imaginary right you re thinking of something about imaginary and it s not if it s down that has to do with a negative right if there s a negative a coefficient something else though what would this mean for the company s trend deshawn go ahead deshawn they would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up and come back down purple are you alright with that now you understand this would not have worked based on what deshawn just said here s my question for you on aol why isn t aol an absolute value graph what starts high comes down and goes back up we did do absolute value functions right turn and talk first and then you re going to tell me write that question down somewhere i want to know why it s not an absolute value graph oh yeah we did talk about these today if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you re getting ten members then every five minutes you re gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible ok guys bring it back i want to know why isn t why didn t anybody say absolute value i m going to maybe put one over here and then i have one more really important question about these graphs for you and then we re in good shape absolute value the reason i asked that is because that also starts high comes down low and goes back up i need some reasoning let s change it around start with gold and go around go i don t think it s an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend because in the absolute value it s y is equal to absolute value of x meaning that as time passed they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people so like if you gained ten members every five minutes every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what every five minutes or when it goes down every five minutes you d be losing ten members whereas a parabola that changes is not constant you can lose and gain power then they d be equal to join or don t join and you can t guarantee that you re going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed so would it be fair to say it s too con,0.0
two times two aggregating rules smaller the denominator the bigger the fraction that don t work sometimes i know what you re thinking six eighths okay one two three hey look four five six you know it s like division too yeah that s okay six eighths versus what six eighths versus three fourths okay one two three four five six they re equal they re equal one two three they re equal i just did that they re equal wait wait wait wait that s what i said didn t you hear me say that i said if you do equivalent fraciton it is divide by two can we do it the easy way nah cause this is basically the easy way i mean look okay what if we didn t have tiles what if we didn t have imagine if we didn t have tiles we d have paper and pen people back in the days they never had colorful they didn t have a pencil neither oh yeah well you know what i m talking about they had clay and a pointy stick all right so where s the paper you guys want to use a pen or pencil i already got one so who wants to go first i ll go first i will okay group members i can t really explain it you can t really explain it then show me if i said four tenths and one third okay so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third looking at those fraction bars because you add this and minus this it s it s one more than you need no because if you add one tenth to one third it s still going to be bigger oh yeah all right but just looking at these two if i said one third and four tenths which one s bigger four tenths four tenths how do you know by looking at them because three four like six four tenths it s wider than one third good it s wider than one third so now you guys just finished envelope number two and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two who s turn is it to write kayla kayla s so why don t you read the group question for envelope number two without using the fraction tiles how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half how could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half so what about that question how would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half just like we told you it s because twelve well twelve six is half of six twelve yeah six twelve is half of a twelve and five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths okay very good what about what about five eighths is bigger than one half israel what do you think how would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half five eighths yeah how could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half this question right here how would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half because like more eighths one eighth is bigger than like one and like more it adds one half and one half so what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half huh which number which fraction with eight as the denominator would be equal to one half four eighths why do you say four eighths it s one half can you show me with the fraction tiles didn t you say not to use the fraction tiles i know but i want him to see that he s right that four eighths is equal to one half okay guys okay good so then how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half it s one more one more you add to it you know that one eighths is equal to one half because they re like even numbers one eighth is equal to one half four eighths four eighths that four eighths is equal to one half okay all right guys keep on going answer the questions for envelope number two and you guys can get started on envelope number three okay all right guys so you guys are on envelope number one yeah we re done with envelope one we re just like answering this question you re doing what we re done with envelope one but we re answering it okay so what is the question for envelope number one anthony can you read it it is someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third because the bigger the number the smaller the fraction are they correct how would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect so that s something that i ve heard a lot of people in the class say that the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction is that always true no no why well because well the smaller the denominator that means like sometimes it could be like smaller smaller but sometimes i think like well actually you re doing good keep on going well since like they re the whole okay so like two pieces is two pieces one s shaving it all away and the other one is for so what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction how many pieces the thing is cut into how many pieces it s cut into what does a numerator tell us about a fraction how many are shaded how many are shaded so then why right here why right here is nine tenths so much bigger or bigger than one third because it s close to one whole because it s close to one whole and how could you explain it with what we just talked about savannah because it s 10 is the denominator and three is the other so if there s 10 that means there s 10 of the small pieces and there s nine of the small of those pieces but there s nine of those pieces so how many of those pieces are shaded in nine good and what about for one third how many pieces would we shade in for one third one good all right guys well keep on going keep on going you guys are doing well try to answer these questions and then start with envelope number two okay all right guys keep going all right so which envelope are you guys on right now one we re answering the questions you re answering the questions yeah and now i m writing it down four so what did you say what did you actually say for the second question oh we like if you just i m not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it but we just we all agreed that if you keep simplifying simplifying a fraction into its lowest terms and if it can t go any lower than like then it s one half or one third you ll know if if it s equivalent to one half or you can find a common denominator you can find a common denominator and that will allow you to do what to see if they re both the same number to see if they re both the same number yeah pretty much the same number okay why don t you guys start envelope number two then open up envelope number two and see how you order these on the fraction line let s try one half first first three fourths wait wait yeah three fourths goes right there five eighths goes right here no no it ll go right here wait it goes right here so why don t you guys use the fraction bars then to figure it out because i know three fourths is half of one three fourths is half of wait no it would be more it s half of it would be more it would be right here wait i want you i want you to explain that a little bit better for me you said that three fourths is half of one half i mean one fourth is half of one half ok one fourth is half of one half so what about three fourths then and three fourths would go right here because two fourths is equal to one half and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half right also i was going to say that since we all know one half is right here three fourths would go in front of five eighths because one half of eight is four eighths and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths and then that s not the same three fourths of eight would be six eighths good and how do you know that four over four goes right over here cause it s one it s one whole wait no that would be the same place as three fourths wait yeah that would be the same place why would it be the same place because oh it is you said it s an equivalent fraction can you explain what they said why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions because they re the same because because four times two is eight and three times two is six okay and why does that make two fractions equivalent then could you show me using fraction tiles i ll help you you can do this four five six so how many of these do you need six seven so what are you getting the six for i m getting eight six i already have six though three fourths one two wait where are the fourths i believe right over oh okay so show me show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths what do you notice we notice that they re the same length they re the same length and also we know that pretty much what akosha said that if you multiply or if yeah if you multiply like if you multiply three times two and four times two it s six eighths because four times two is yeah four times two is eight and three times two is six do you notice anything else about it here that two eighths equals one fourth good good all right guys let me see the rest of this yeah how did you know that five twelfths was less than one half go ahead six is half of twelve and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths okay okay why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths cause like we don t that the smaller the denominator the bigger it is and so one fourth would be in the middle so that would be on the other side of one fourth okay all right guys keep on going you re doing good we ve over it s over so which one are you guys on now four but we need help with one of the questions on three five no we need help on number four let s look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on then we re not we just have a question on what it is a conjecture a conjecture so conjecture is something that we we ve talked about before in math if it says what conjecture it s kind of like what a hypothesis is in science,0.0
at the end of class i want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further because the faster the bat goes the further the ball s gonna go and there s three things that we re going to do to make the bat swing faster okay we re going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer we re gonna hold the end to make it longer a longer bat means a faster bat we re gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we re gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing and we re learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy because there s lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles and we re gonna do four different things today i m gonna ask you to talk to a partner i m gonna do a little experiment we re gonna play spotlight tag and then we re gonna have some personal practice and i ve created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster i want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement go ahead hey everybody let me get your attention if i pull your stick i want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something we re green no we re red jeremiah where s jeremiah yes softball softball very good raquel where s raquel what raquel game or something you can play do we use a bat to play soccer no no how about stephanie baseball who said golf what about golf what about ping pong do you know what ping pong is yeah so all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat now we re gonna go around the blue house and you re gonna sit on the red dot until i say go and i m gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further i would like you to walk please be careful go okay thank you for sitting now over there i said the longer the bat the faster it goes the faster the bat the further the ball goes so i m gonna show you what i mean is this a very long bat no no so i m gonna swing and see how far it goes did it go very far no now i m gonna make that longer who thinks it s gonna go further let s see if it goes further it went a little bit further huh yes now by holding the bat at the end it ll make it longer and it ll go further now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles so i m only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat you think this will this go very far yeah yeah okay let s see no i didn t use a lot of muscle now i m gonna use lots of muscles on this step and i m gonna twist see how far it goes do it again do a lot of muscle anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster hit from the bottom i had it written over there does anyone else remember i want to make my bat longer i want to use lots of muscles and alex that s how we use lots of muscles i want to swing the bat for as long as i can in order to generate speed now if i start my bat right here and i swing it do i have lots of time to hit the ball no do you think it ll go far let s see what happens now if i start way back here do you think i ll have more time yeah you think it ll go further yeah all right let s see so raise your hand if you want to hit the ball far hitting the ball far will help you be successful and if you re successful you re going to have a good time but today we re going to learn different ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast don t swing please tell me it makes the bat go faster why does the bat go faster the bat goes faster the ball goes faster but what makes the bat go faster because it s short or long long longer bat means faster okay rotate rotate dominant hand on top step twist we re practicing what grip is the best how d that one go fernanda what grip are you using mr holden can i go to the bathroom hurry excellent twisting derek excellent twisting what number are you going to read it try this one hold your bat with your hands apart put your left hand on top i mean your right hand on the top left hand at the bottom spread your hands apart like this now try it again how did that go is that one good you think so now hold it at the end see what happens it s right here now hold your hands put your right hand on the top right hand on the top your right hand on top all right fernanda big step let s see it big step twist your whole body get your bat back there you go try it again did the ball go further that time okay sit behind your little cone and answer the question on your card alright now read it out loud for me which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest holding it at the end remember when we talked about how long the bat is a longer bat can travel faster or slower faster so when you hold it at the end it makes it longer and then you can swing it faster and then the ball goes further is that what happened yeah all right rotate alright are you going to twist or not twist back foot step put your weight on your front foot alright so pretend your feet are stuck in mud so you can t move them so we ve been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far because when we hit the ball far our game and when we re batting is more enjoyable we ve practiced we ve talked about and we ve discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further when we re batting okay i have a sentence frame for you it says i can blank to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further okay you re in your batting team groups right now when i say go i want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further and then i m gonna pull our sticks and you ll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster so now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers are there any questions no okay i m gonna give you about two minutes use the sentence frame discuss with your group go ahead alright how is your group doing jesse you getting to share i might pick your stick talk with alex what are we coming up with jeremiah how are we gonna make the bat go faster do you remember okay how about alex why do we twist alex alex why do we twist alex sit up please when we twist we use more what muscles what color were we black or green red oh we were red okay second grade eyes on me please sit down on a number you ve had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster if i pick your name please stand up speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster let s see here jonathan all right jonathan stand up buddy jonathan use the sentence frame i can i can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further good answer give him a round of applause when we have a longer bat it generates more speed and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster,0.0
are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90 no so you won t have any complementary to worry about is that supplementary though you will have supplementary right you re not gonna have to worry about the outside you re just gonna look at your inside when you measure your angles you ll be able to see supplementary yeah then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why we re supposed to draw a line well i want you to see what s congruent sides now you dont have to measure all your sides because have these so you ve got the same colors so they re all the same you re don t have to do angles kinda figure out ok so they re all 90 degrees one of yours looks 90 so you know they re 90s so you got for the outside of your figure you got some a little bit easier work yeah ok so you need to explain why things are 90 and what are congruent and then you re gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there then you ll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles so you know a lot about a square to start with yeah the equal sides have to be congruent and certain sides so write that then measure those angles and segments and see if you can t find some more rules that go with a square oh ok so yes your first set of rules for the first page from here you know a lot you know that any point and what they are you know you have equal sides then you don t have to measure these sides because you used the same color so you can explain it using the colors so you got a lot you know from the first part but then when you draw your diagonals here you re gonna have to measure your pieces see what happens to these angles see what happens to these diagonals and then see if you can t come up with some rules you re main part here you know a lot but now when we do this this will some of the new ok square is the last one that we teach so you will be the last group up there today right we re trying to get these rules today you can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there yeah there s just three of you ok how you doing good what do you notice about some of these corresponding is what i got here down here these are supplementary supplementary because they re what type of angles help him respond well there are options focus on one if we were to look at if i was continuing these lines here they re gonna be same side interior obviously yes so they re not quite supplementary so you might need to go back and do it again sammy knows they need to be supplementary same side interior somehow your measurements didn t get there so go back and try to remeasure you realize you wrote the error that s good so you re using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error yeah so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day when you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way you read 122 when it s going this way it s 118 so what you did is you read this way when you re going this way you said 122 when it s between 120 and 110 at least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it you said it was only off by one degree any amount then again to then explain your rules now what s congruent what s supplementary and then explain why like you were saying same side interior that s what you ll have yes do you have chester marlin yes i do please send him to the office ok what you did was perfect because they re same side interior so you would say this would you say equal angle one and angle four that d be fine because you can go ahead and when you re teaching it you can label those angles and that would be a really good way to do it so it s like angle one and angle four are same side interior same side interior so that has to equal 180 ok bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there your second page when you redraw the figure you re gonna draw the diagonals you re gonna see your diagonals cut each other you re gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half i ll be to ashley then at brandon s group in just a minute so make sure your congruent sides you don t have to measure your sides if you use your colors you can use colors to explain it so yeah you re exactly on the right track here we re just gonna draw the same figure draw those diagonals in there and then we got a little bit some more things you might see bisectors you might not some figures you do and some you don t all right ok it s up to you i love the way you put your letters there so you re getting really good with your letters you can say since you only have one angle at each letter you can say angle j or angle h however you want to do that could we just put supplementary and draw a little diagonal like that that d be fine actually do all these and you ve got your congruent and your angles then you re gonna redraw the same thing over here put your diagonals in and measure again when you put diagonals in you might see some that bisect the angles or bisect segments you might not but that s what you re looking for so this is gonna be well the diagonals we re not gonna draw one of them oh we re not no we re just gonna look at our diagonals otherwise you re breaking it into two other figures and that s a possibility but you don t have to i love the way that you ve lettered it here you re using those correct terms that ll be really good as you go up there all right brandon what all did we mess up so far let s see well it s a four sided figure what should a four sided figure add up to 360 360 does it no it s a little more than 360 so you might need to change things a little bit to remeasure it and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360 there s some that i see really right away that s good it s like 370 ok so you re gonna try to make it work you know you need to make it work you know it s gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better can we just add one here and add two there well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are but one good thing you see you see that these angles are the same which is something you re supposed to come up with which is good now if i was giving this when you re up there explaining it you need a way to explain and i know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent and in your picture that s good but sometimes let s think for a minute if i gave you write them out yeah it may always be the obtuse angle so here yeah that s what i was thinking if you were to do it this way the angles that are congruent aren t necessarily the obtuse ones so what you ve found is good but in your picture it is the obtuse ones but if you can see as you move that it doesn t have to be the obtuse ones let s look at a way we can describe you re saying that these two angles are congruent which is correct so instead of saying obtuse how can i explain that these two and not those two what s the difference between these two angles and those two angles they re 45 degrees well it didn t have to be it could be 45 it looks 45 if i was to do this it s not it s the short side s angles it s where your short sides meet your long sides so the angles with the non congruent sides or the short sides meet the long angles that would be perfect that would be a little better to explain it and even when you re up there explaining a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn t have to be and normally it s the bigger angles but it doesn t have to be draw diagonals that s right and you re gonna look for all the angles again when you draw your diagonals a lot of times you re gonna see bisectors like segments might bisect each other they might bisect angles they might or they might not so that s what you re looking for when you do that and then you re gonna kind of come up to we just draw them like this just like that that s right then you ll measure all of those angles and all of those segments we won t be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside because you won t have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals so you ll actually have to measure that part with a ruler but again you re not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else so that s what you ll do all right i ll be right back yes so are we supposed to do this you don t need the angles that are out there i mean you could but it s not necessary what should of course our figure add up to the angles inside uh huh 360 360 so make sure yours do what if they don t so i think if i was to look at your measurements here i know what i did i messed up i wrote these good perfect that s what i was gonna get to you read the wrong one and didn t notice all right i ll be right back how are you doing so you want to make some general rules so the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel i wouldn t really want to use the words top and bottom because what if you turn it this way yeah well a and b sides yeah so you re gonna do that so you ve got your pieces what do you notice about your angles you ve got the angles that are equal but what if i was looking for supplementary do you have any supplementary angles a and d a and d so you say a and d are supplementary what makes them supplementary what rule do we already know that was why they re supplementary they add up to 180 right they add up to 180 but are they same side interior angles same side interior angles so you can say they re 180 because they re same side interior angles then what you re gonna do you re gonna go to this page you re gonna draw your figure again but you ve got to draw your diagonals and measure the things when you draw the diagonals what you re really looking for is to see is there anything that cuts in half do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments some figures do some figures don t but that s what you re looking for so you re gonna redraw it draw your diagonals then measure you ll have more angles to measure you re actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won t match your diagonals correctly you re gonna have to actually do the measurements and see see if the segments are bisected see if the angles are bisected that s kind of what you re gonna come up with it may be it may not be some of the figures do and some don t ok i think i understand that we draw from angles to angles yeah from vertex to vertex that s right so make an x in the middle all right you re good yes i think we have about everything and then i think we have the other vertex angle bisectors they bisect the angle number five all the triangles are isosceles wow that s good i didn t think you d get that i m impressed he did it good job and then diagonals make a perpendicular perfect what i m gonna do is i m gonna give you another sheet make a bigger square,0.0
no i want you to swing the eighth notes okay we re going to swing the eighth notes so remember when you swing you just make the first note longer than the second note so go like this don t be stuck at the tip of your bells here we go one a two a three and go every single person here please make sure you re playing f natural try it again here we go one two and go okay now when you guys improvise you ve got to improvise off of this d dorian scale okay so watch this if i was soloing and i was you know playing along with the music and i played this all i did was play the d dorian scale going up and down that s all it was it sounded a little fancy didn t it it really wasn t did it sound difficult yes it really wasn t i just did this like really changing the rhythm that s basically all i did okay so it s really not that difficult i m gonna play some rhythms i want you guys to echo it please sit up thank you nice and tall i m gonna play one measure and you re going to repeat exactly what i play we re playing this one on open d only on open d great now i m going to do two measures okay two measures and you ve got to echo it back to me this is still open d here we go wait for it i ll tell you when to go excellent okay it goes like this i m going to change it and go there it is okay it s just four notes in the second measure so try it again and go do this for me and go try this i m playing d and f so the higher pitch that you hear is f natural so play this for me great fantastic i m only going to add one more note you want to play d f and g okay with the exception of basses so do an open g okay so d f and g are your three notes all right get in playing position okay so basically that s improvising i m giving you a lot of ideas for improvising okay and you will only use three notes when you improvise d f and g you don t have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes when you improvise there are certain rules to improvising you can t just play any note because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice okay so we don t want to play the wrong note so please make sure that you only play d f and g do you see that tune that s on whatever page that s on for you guys there should be a page that s got solos at the top and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune you ll pick the third one with the tune do you guys see it yeah okay make sure you re on the correct side i ll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds and then i m going to have you guys play it okay listen to my tempo are you guys following along okay play it for me here we go watch your rests one two and go much better now good now play it again one two and go good i want you to play it one more time i m going to play the piano with you though all right here we go great now i m going to solo for you guys and i want to show you how you can do this okay a couple things that i did in there all i did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note that s all i did it sounds really difficult didn t it yeah it was like whoa no i m just going i can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult you can do it too okay so we re going to go around the room each person is going to solo okay whatever musical idea you come up with remember your notes are d f and g you got it d f and g whatever rhythm you want to play within the rhythms i gave you so don t okay here we go here s how we re going to do it we re going to start with maybe two measures we re going to start with tessa and go around maybe after helen then we go with tallulah priscilla listen carefully after tallulah we re going to go around this way after jada we re going to start with sammy and we re going to end with zoey okay we re all going to start with two,0.0
but you re putting children in your sweatshops how are you gonna get more money how are you gonna finance the country still both of you need to listen to cambodia because cambodia i am awesome cambodia is awesome what are you doing to fix this well for the money problem i m not really sure but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you re getting better pay em off and then for and then for child labor you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn so that way they can get better skills and stuff and then put their after that works and everything to age laws i m the only one with an answer i have no child labor whatsoever whoa whoa whoa i thought we discussed that you do have child labor but well we do have some child labor but it s more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired so what do i win as the only one with an answer how did you pull your country off child labor you need to be giving them suggestions and ideas ok what can we do what can we do to crack you told us some solutions the other day right so that s why you guys are supposed to be discussing now ok china do you wanna go ahead and so china you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country you have a plan you have your whole plan in place pretty much what s the first step what s the second step what s the third step what you re gonna do yeah you wanna hear it i do first we ll make it illegal for children to work all day and the other half they go to school ok but wait a minute but don t your parents your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in yes but if they work half the day while they re at school they still earn money but then they re losing half their income but then on weekends they can but they work weekends right now anyway maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there oh now there s an idea what they could establish a minimum wage yeah ok so you re gonna establish a minimum wage yes and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they re employed so they can get more money with better jobs so then they don t have that issue so what are you going to do in the process because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated what are you gonna do in that gap you still have to have a plan for those 12 13 14 years what about programs like those they used in like the de de depression that s the word ok that s what you guys should be discussing those are some of the things you should be coming up with they could start keep in mind that needs money but then they would get loans from wealthier countries and as they re getting stronger and more ok take those ideas and work with them you guys are on the right track you re rolling with it so put that down establish a minimum wage ok cameroon what was your solution say the children stop working and the adults get it well it would be taking money away from the family not other than the ones we came up with on friday like have countries send money what about that like education like half school half work campaign it s like where where you re working part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home and then like with me in my country already go to school so i guess all those times you mentioned but they only go for like six years from age 7 to wait i don t know ok anyway that would help with like the country being france for the win like the same thing but more coffee ok if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things where s your country where s your country ok never mind i was thinking you move at the same time but no if we work together with the coffee export like if we combine the export if we produce well i meant like from whatever we sell we could try to hawk them together to help each other create better education y all can combine your profits in coffee and begin making schools you have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money correct right ok but remember you don t sell that product to the customers you re selling it to the businesses but that s bringing money in to your businesses it s the businesses that hire people and you create jobs so you need to figure out a way to take that industry that product and expand it so that it s bringing more money and bringing more jobs which is gonna help because then you ll have adults you have 45 income we can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs what would be a suitable age eighteen eighteen this mine is not an easy job is it it s hard work it s dangerous down there to have twelve year old kids down there you re still united nations correct is that gonna be agreeable to you you can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product so whatever she suggests to you you have to make sure that that s ok because remember you can tell her sorry it s not gonna happen yup which means you have more money going out than coming in correct so you need to figure out a way to change that you need some money coming in so what are the strengths your country has that you could potentially build and grow when she s got the diamonds i saw a pendant on the internet and it had like a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string ok that s a factory purchase but what you could make i don t know that s what you need to know what does your economy depend on i mean you have to produce something it says making foreign ok i have a question what is a foreign exchange it s nestea s largest exporter so you are exporting product so you do have some products that you re exporting oh you re taiwan you have a lot of textile factories you make clothing your country s the one that s got all the sweatshops so that s what you need you need to build you should be suggesting some ideas to her giving her ideas say ok you ve got a product to export but you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do this they need to find some way to pay exactly wait i have a question for the united nations ok how you said setting up your steps well if there s not a lot of educated people then how are they gonna find teachers well if you said exactly well first you could hire people from different countries maybe if you like hired somebody from like the us that s educated they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they re educated they re doing the same thing that kids are they ve been in child labor and stuff plus when they got older they re just working again so they haven t really changed anything so to change that i guess maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children so you couldn t get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers and the kids have no where to go well i say since they re already adults that we kinda like work on the children more with education i guess because the children are small so before you even take the kids out of these places you have to get all the people and you have to so you have to figure out some like you re gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that s gonna take it s basically you re taking elementary schools you like i mean they could set up a scholarship that way they could go from like and even your country could help pay help pay the people that are teaching because in the long run you re gaining that money s gonna be spent the population is gonna face it they get the cotton for the clothes and get the food for their teachers and all that if we can help poverty to help pay for some schools yes that would be amazing we could also have all the adults work the rest of their life like insanely or something i m the government i can say hey there s laws now that a kid s gotta go to school and he can t work so many days of work so many hours of work,0.0
how s everybody today good good okay we are gonna work our bodies real hard today and we are gonna play a game called wellness uno how many people raise your hand if you ve ever played uno absolutely put your hands down do you know that there are four colors in uno who knows what one color is alexis what is it blue what s another one um red red what s another one nate yellow yellow green green absolutely okay we ve got the uno cards spread all around the circle here first graders and what we re gonna do is in just a minute you re gonna come up here and you re gonna get an uno card i might pick this one right here this one is a green four green four okay i look at it and then i put it right back if you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones point to where the green color zone is boom you got a green cone over there stay right there watch ms miller the green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station so if this is you have choices when you come over here first graders choice number one you can get a rope and you can swing how many times four four swing four times which rope would be easier to swing on alexis the knot one the knot one cause you can hang on to it better that s right so you can swing or can come over here and you can do those bicep curls that we ve been working on in muscular strength and endurance stand right here to the wall and do that four times nice and what slow slow absolutely and here s your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station if i got what was my number again four four look there s four hula hoops on the rock wall you would start here and you would go through hula hoop one then hula hoop two three four what happens if i had a green two how many hula hoops would i go through paige how many would i go through two just two okay so it s either four whatever number that is that s the number of hula hoops you go through then i come back over here and i pick another card hmm did i pick this one oh i just picked that one let s pick this one what color s that yellow three yellow three point to the yellow color zone absolutely the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone and guess what you have to do here first grade there is a cone here and it says yellow add zero what was my number three three and if i add a zero to that what does that make that number thirty thirty that s what we re gonna have to do i have my choice i have to do thirty of something over here here are my choices i m gonna do thirty oh gonna work my heart thirty step boxes or if i don t wanna do that i can do the ball on the stick how many times thirty thirty and if i m really good and if i really wanna try i can get a jump rope right there on the wall and i can try jump roping thirty times now i m gonna run back here and i m gonna get another card and i m gonna get this one right here this one is a red six uh oh red nine red nine it s a red nine see where that line is under there so that means it s a nine red nine point to the red color zone woo you guys are so smart i come over here to the red color zone and look what does the red color zone have on it times two times two so what was my number nine nine what s nine times two say it alexis eleven not eleven this is hard what s nine plus nine what is it nathan do you know what is it ethan 18 it s 18 so we re gonna do 18 ms miller will help you with the math if you don t know so we re gonna times that one by two and here are my choices i m gonna come over here and i m gonna get a paddle and i m gonna this is a hand eye i m gonna use my hands and my eyes i m gonna put my safety strap on and i m gonna do how many of these 6 9 18 18 that s right 18 and first grade how can i challenge myself at this station if i wanted to make this station harder for myself how would i do that courtney um use your left hand use your other hand ms miller is left handed so if i use my left hand i would use my right hand so if you want to challenge yourself you d use your other hand so you re gonna do that how many times 18 18 okay so that s you could either do that at this station or i love these these are the i call them the ice cream cones look you throw that ball and you re gonna catch that ball do it again that s how many two two and you re gonna do that all the way til you get to whatever number you have at that station that was using your hands and your eyes watching that ball right into that cup and now i m gonna come over here and i m gonna get one more and oh i just grabbed that one let s see what s oh what s this number blue blue six where s the blue color zone point where s the blue color zone over there hey the blue color zone is balancing watch ms miller over here you re gonna come over here and if you don t wanna touch the gym floor ethan sit down for me you re gonna step on the stepping stones and you can either step on the sides of the ladder or if you wanna make it harder for yourself you can step on these rungs and balance all the way to the bleachers step up come across and then we re gonna go on this balance beam hey first graders when we re balancing do we go fast or slow slow slow we go slow we don t wanna go fast at this station because we wanna have good balance and we don t wanna fall we wanna make sure we don t touch the gym floor so that s wait what was my number again i forgot nine it was a nine red how many times would i go then nine nine times around there or your choice is the hippity hops now ms miller s a little big for this hippity hop but you kinda get the idea you just use the boing hop hop to the black line it s one and then back is how many two so i would do that nine times okay those are your choices so there s four stations yellow red excuse me green and blue turn around and face ms miller now i wanna talk to you about something really quick it s something called personal integrity you ready back there ethan everybody sit on your bottoms sit on your bottoms personal integrity and first does anybody know what personal integrity is do you think you know maddie when you hear that what do you think that means listening listening okay what do you think maria if you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card you can t put it back and get the one you want ah wow do i like that definition absolutely personal integrity this is the way i think of it is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching you said it maria you know what my favorite i really like those swing ropes over there i really like to do that would i have personal integrity if i came over here and i did this i got a card and it s like ooh blue i don t wanna go to blue i wanna put that back ooh there s another blue i don t want that would i have personal integrity if i kept picking cards until i got what i wanted no can ms miller watch every person get a card no no so you have to have some personal integrity whatever card you get that s the one what happens if i just got a blue card and i come over here and i pick another blue one what am i gonna do what am i gonna do paige you put it back down and you get another one but not the same one no no no we re not gonna get another one we re going to what it s okay you just go back to the blue station that s right you re just gonna go back to the blue station and just maybe if you did the hippity hops maybe do the balance drill next time outstanding okay we re gonna get started this is what i want you to do oh i forgot one more rule when you get a card do you ever run across the indian no do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out we don t wanna bump into anybody nelson do you have a question do you have a question about something you d probably rip the card you would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself hands down let s get started i m gonna call months of the year and if i call your month of the year that your birthday is in then you re gonna get up and you re gonna go get a card are you ready if you have a birthday in january february or march go get a card how bout april may and june july august september october november and december let s go what d you get chris let s see man what is that talk to me red eight red eight do you know what eight plus eight is eight plus eight think about that almost 16 go do 16 of those good job buddy hey paige you wait on the end of the mat there until alexis is done what s your number alexis four don t hold the bottom grab up at the top like brian is doing that s perfect yeah what was your number one what was it one one did you do one do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card ooh steven steven what d you get man what is it blue seven it s a blue seven go hey ethan what d you get now remember the line means what a yellow six okay what are you gonna do with that yellow six wait come here look at me you re gonna put a no you re gonna add a what to the end of that a zero and that makes it what number 60 yeah let s go woo look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station they are going up up down down they are getting their heart rates up what number did you have maddie um 50 50 holy moly keep counting it goes like this maddie up up down down that s one every time you hit the ground that s one okay woo be careful that s okay just hold it up like this watch watch you see how it whirls like this at the bottom there you go like that it can get pretty hard yeah chris i saw one card that was um um it was turned over oh did you so i flipped it over oh really thank you so much i appreciate you taking care of the cards for me here you go five times two what s five plus five ten ten that s what it is jamie what d you get forty forty did you get four yellow go woo look at these hippity hops over here outstanding man are you guys doing a good job i like how you re going really slow at this station that s good balancing ooh chris way to get your balance back slow down buddy woah nelson i know can you put one foot in front of the other can you bring your other foot in front wanna try it ms miller s right here in case you have to grab onto me yeah look at that what a good balancer you are i balance on the monkey bars you balance on the monkey bars yeah woo good job you did it good job all right what d you get buddy blue four hey are you supposed to have your card with you i ll go put it back for you remember to leave the card

you re gonna put a what on the end of it a what are you gonna put on it a zero what does that make it 70 go woo maddie you got a blue nine yes no kidding don t go running what is that card a yellow four and what are you gonna add to that four,0.0
look at your station one information and the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather and yesterday you guys constructed a graph to show that data why is it useful to construct a graph in science class sky because it s a visual way to show you information it s a visual way to show you information i have a case up here as an example based on that graph what does that pattern reveal about our question gabrielle the cooler the temperature the more the i mean more increases in time the more what increases in time the more uh weather okay anybody want to restate that rebecca the colder it is the more time it takes to weather very good the colder it is the more time it takes to weather if we re talking about dissolving a tablet is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering logan chemical weathering chemical weathering so the colder it is the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur would you agree thumbs up or thumbs down thumbs up i would agree now i want to talk about so what why does it matter to us why does it matter in our daily lives talk about it for one minute record your thoughts on your wipe board and be ready to share back we could consider where to build our stuff in what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot what about up north you ve got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts okay it might dissolve faster in a warmer place or what type of rock would i want to avoid limestone why okay very good very good alright let s share some of our ideas with the class info managers table three what did you find if you live in a cold environment there will be less chemical weathering than there is in a warm place good point if you live in a cooler environment there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate who s gonna be particularly concerned with this what for instance job field is gonna be concerned with this idea forrest construction that would be one area what else statue building yeah any kind of artist who s designing statues what type of rock would you want to avoid if you re living in a warm area and you know that chemical weathering could be a problem what rock would you avoid patrick limestone limestone do you guys have some proof for me somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone which station alex station three flip to station three for me at station three who can explain to me what the lab was that you did someone i haven t heard from colin we put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk and the chalk didn t dissolve in the water but the acid made it fizz bubble and it was just dissolving and why did we use chalk what is chalk a type of what is chalk a type of jeremy it s a type of limestone it s a type of limestone so your evidence showed that yes limestone weathers quickly with acid why is acid a part of our environment how does it become part of our environment andrea acid rain acid rain acid rain now as we grow up it s important that you re environmental advocates that you fight for protecting our environment what types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain give me two ideas on your wipe boards two ideas is that polluting our water our air polluting the air and it s getting into our clouds very nice very good so air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation you are making worst case scenarios you don t have to consider the unthinkable it can happen alright you don t have to consider the impossible so we can unplug outlets when we re not using them we can turn off the water when we brush our teeth what about things in your house electricity cut down on your electric bills remember you burn fossil fuels to make electricity so right now as middle schoolers the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use alright i want every table to share one idea info manager from table one give me one idea one idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school instead of like everybody having their own individual cars good point or even better you can walk instead of having that carpool line going on let s take busses table two give me one idea save power by changing your lightbulbs to cfls yeah use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs they use a lot less electricity good idea table three give me one conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth now conserving water think about what the question was how can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain we can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets very good unplug items from the outlets that s good table four we could use hybrid cars hybrid cars that s good they burn less fossil fuels good idea table five recycle recycle how would that help acid rain okay so it s cutting down on factory use that would be a good one table six cutting down on electricity alright cutting down on electricity because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels table seven is there any that haven t been said carpool to work and school carpool to work and school i love it you got something to add i was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them yeah very good a lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling but it s good to reuse too that s a good idea as well so we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering we haven t yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering which lab would answer that question how temperature affects mechanical weathering station four alright look at station four take one minute you don t have to write this one down discuss it what does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life take one minute and it like ice wedges and then it ll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks what were you supposed to be measuring in centimeters you measured in milimeters but you meant to measure in centimeters so how much was it in centimeters well if you said it was at 79 which would be right there what centimeters is that at around 15 write down 15 oh wait wait i had it going the wrong way and no one even noticed so if it was at 79 where would it be at 79 the tick mark right below the 80 about 16 about 16 and if it was at 76 where would it be at about 14 and a half very good alright let s pick someone at random who s the lucky person andrew p what did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid when it was frozen it was taller when it was frozen it was taller what does that mean that it was taller lucy well the water was frozen to ice so it expands a little it expands i like the use of that word water expands as it freezes here in louisville how is that a problem and it s been a particularly big problem this winter ethan because like the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads right very good point now that affects us here in kentucky because we have those cold winters what types of areas would it not affect forrest florida florida areas that don t have freezing that s a good point now we ve talked about climate as far as temperature goes we ve talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering what is the other aspect of climate other than temperatures other than temperature what is another aspect of climate patrick how humid it is how humid it is which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather flip through sky seven let s look at station seven now during our labs the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready a material manager can someone explain to me what s the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup what would that difference be lucy well the steel wool that was covered well the steel wool that wasn t covered with the cup it was all like stuck together and it wasn t rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out like it wasn t all stuck together and it was rusting okay so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened had a lot of rust and the one that was moistened but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust would you agree okay what is the purpose of covering it why do i cover that otis keeping the water from evaporating yeah it s keeping that water in so is the covered cup a dry environment or a humid environment humid environment a very humid environment i have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas and tells you what their humidity is like i m gonna flip off both lights to help you see it this is a tropical wet area tropical dry area semi arid which means dry arid then marine west coast mediterranean and humid sub tropical these areas that are marked as humid sub tropical such as down in florida those areas that are marked as humid what do they have to be cautious about if it s a humid area what do they have to be cautious about don t see a lot of hands talk about it for one minute what do humid areas have to be cautious about now think about this an area like kentucky and our summers aren t just hot they re humid so we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering and we have to deal with yeah so we re kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios yes we definitely are good point alright i need someone i haven t heard from to share let s see who the random card is lucy what do you think they have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff they have to be careful of rusting good point because the more humid the air is the more likely you are to have what oxidation now there was another lab where we used steel wool what was the purpose of the other steel wool lab what were you trying to answer what were you trying to determine jamiel what do you think there was the key word the what kind of water salt water you look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate you look to see if salt water did silently look at your data and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation jeremy did salt water affect the rate of oxidation yeah,0.0
this one is probably medium so this one is mine so this has to be a medium and this one has to be a large because my medium is half way up to here so it has to be a large so you make a prediction about how many small rocks it takes to make a big i think it s gonna be 12 small rocks that s a good idea put our small rocks we have here so we make it draw two little blocks and if we have 12 draw a rectangle and just put put your line through right here what do you think how many small rocks i think that there is going to be eight we have eight rocks so i think that there s going to be what about you i have 10 11 12 boys and girls i had a good question if you ve got more rocks than you do boxes you know that we ve got how many boxes how many boxes ten there s ten so at the top you can write since we ve been working with place value with tens and ones you can put ten we know that s how many boxes we have you could put plus six if you have which number 16 16 if you all had 11 what could you do you got ten so you would write plus one if you had 12 you would write you ve got 10 so what would you write above it plus two so you can do it that way good question now what about you make a prediction of five then you ask us how many baby rocks we think that ten makes i think that there is going to be these can be large and there s one two three four four larges he s already told you how many mediums there are however you think very good so you ve got yours sorted by size or you could see if there s another way you can sort your rocks we just did size first so we could do our work very smart very smart tell me about looking at the graph how many small you had diana how many small rocks were there five alright how many medium rocks did you have 11 and how many large four good good and you sorted them oh you got some nice rocks oooh nice rock there it s pretty neat now this looks much better much better medium there s one two three four five six seven eight nine three four five six seven eight nine 10 wait wait one two three four five now we need five more to make 15 one two three four five six seven eight nine four five six seven eight nine i counted 14 put them together one two three four i d say like maybe it goes with the white okay what about this one that goes with the white right what about this one hmm i d say like what does it have the most of i d say probably white what about this one this one goes for tan this one is this one goes this one goes too this goes with the gray too this one goes to the i think it goes it goes with the white now let s see i think it s a pretty rock wait oh that one goes there i know it they all do wait these go with the green no this one this one is gray it s still got sand in it this one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish i d say like maybe green too we ll have all yes okay now this rock okay diana cam and gaelin what i want you to do is you ll probably how about you just take the rocks because i can t remember what s going on we re sorting them a different way you re sorting them a different way and what way would that be how did you all decide to sort rocks i thought we d sort them by color and now we re gonna do it by cut tell me that again because i don t i don t know that part now since we did the color we re going to do is we re going to do by texture what s texture it s by how it feels oh well can you teach me find out the texture from these two rocks i see how it feels and since this one feels very smooth i ll put it by itself well can i feel it pretty smooth pretty smooth have you felt it feel it how you think it feels smooth it does feel pretty smooth and it looks like a piece of meat it looks like a piece a meat yes better not eat a rock should i okay where does this one need to go it needs to go over here we haven t finished quite yet so okay and this one is like i ll say pretty rough pretty rough can i feel this one oh gosh whoo yeah it does feel a little rough it does feel like it s got some sand on it you know a word that i can think of that makes me think of that rough rough or gritty you know sand is gritty feeling well that s kind of gritty it does feel a little rough it can stand up it stands up i m gonna do it put it by itself okay and we re going to keep on doing it until all of them are sorted okay this is a pretty cool rock how does it feel i ll say pretty bumpy kind of rock pretty bumpy pretty rough oh this one s very rough so rough i can hardly stand myself look at the shell on it it does have a shell in it on the other side look on the other side turn it like right here it has another shell it does so what kind of rock would this be a two fossil rock a fossil rock and what kind are they what s it called if it has a fossil imprint in it fossil if it settled and got a fossil sedimentary it would be a sedimentary rock very cool i m so proud of you that was definitely very rough have you felt it this is what do you think on the back is kind of squishy it is rough okay you all keep working you re doing a good job i m proud of you okay now you can put it with the rough the super rough i think this one is i can tell i say medium a little rough a little smooth this one goes in the middle this one is smooth this is super rough let me feel smooth i m gonna put it in the middle because i think very good arianna i like the way you one more medium rock than large because we have eight medium and seven large because you can see a smooth side and a rough side because if you add two more together it make 12 medium is seven and large is eight and i have an idea when you do your rock what about you trace it,0.0
great job thank you for playing along it s so much nicer to play with live accompaniment than it is recorded your assignment two weeks be able to play an improvised solo in this key in f concert utilizing the dorian and mixolydian scales we ll leave in just a moment just relax utilizing the dorian and mixolydian scales i ll ask you to play live on this bosaladera i also want you to outside of class find a latin piece of music it doesn t have to be bossa nova that you can play along with identifying the dorian and the mixolydian scale that fits that key pick a song that you can identify the key and that you feel comfortable playing in that key to bring back and play for us i want a recording here so you re going have to find a mp3 cd dvd something along that you can get to class so you can share this information with each other questions time frame is two weeks if you went through this quickly tell your buddy how long you got and what you have to do go that s a great question thank you yes yes do it in vibes it will be wonderful you can do this it s in f scale it s in f scale is what it is and i saw your results and they were outstanding very good let s all grab an encore thank you and i will see you tomorrow keep the rhythm sync soft as we do our solos here if you would take your pencils and when you hear the soloists play on these notes on the side of this changing i want you to put a mark beside that change where you are put a count on it each rotation will be different sometimes they may play from the middle scale to the middle or the whole thing wherever you think that happens i will be documenting it over here too all right today s volunteers are beginning with the vibe player and then we ll just go through the trumpets the trombones and saxes and those others who are assigned to play today here we go everybody got pencils ready and one one two three four here we go rockville on my mark one two ready one two and one two ready play,0.0
okay guys good morning and welcome to class today we re going to continue our discussion on energy but we re going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven t talked about yet so what i d like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea the big idea for just a moment so the big idea that we re going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table so everybody s got their little stretchy lizard without shooting them we re not doing anything with them yet i d like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea i m going to give you and then we ll just go around and see what you think okay so 30 seconds to think about what s the big idea do you know who your spokesperson is going to be alright guys it s been 30 seconds i m going to go to each table if you could just have your spokesperson ready you could just tell me what your big idea is we re going to put it up here and we re going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we ve done alright so how about we ll start with you guys back here since there s just two of you alright what do you think shawn are you going to speak the sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table okay so the sun might warm up the lizard i just put l for lizard that s alright and make it go across the table robert how about your table who s your spokesperson going to be the energy from the sun once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy okay the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard right is that okay who s your spokesperson we said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table okay so it might make it melt and sticky and that ll make it shoot across the table is that what you said alright kendrick who s your spokesperson going to be blaire it was unanimous alright blaire what do you guys have we were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going is going to do what like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it s going to make it jump okay shine and make it jump nicole did you guys decide who your spokesperson s going to be arrington arrington the sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling okay so the sun gives energy and i didn t hear the last part you want to tell me that helps it that helps it okay and last but not least jada we think that the sun give heat to the and make it more elastic so it would stretch okay so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic i m sorry what was the last part again like make it more elastic so it will stretch more so it ll stretch farther good alright so what i d like to do now is i d like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy so if i call your number i would like you to think about what do you know about let s start with potential energy what do you know about potential energy so if i call your number just tell me one factor one thing that you know about it or an example of it alright we ll start with 15 when an object is like still it doesn t move it s holding it in okay still doesn t move it s holding it in how about number eight robert something you know about potential energy or an example of it the lizards alright very good when the lizard is still when it s moving what do you think still alright very good it s stored energy alright it s stored energy and i ll do one more number two potential energy an example or something that you remember about it the pencil is still the pencil is still alright very good now i know we haven t talked about these topics too much yet but i know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it okay the next thing i d like to know is what do you know what examples do you have what can you remember about kinetic energy so we talked about potential now i d like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy alright so if i call your number let me know what you think number 20 a car moving a car moving alright number 13 a paint can being dropped a paint can being dropped alright very good number 14 when you push a pencil and it rolls alright when you push a pencil and it rolls very good and how about number seven we ll do one more like the energy of motion like the the energy of motion yeah thanks alright and if i didn t call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic anybody have anything else to add about it dylan kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling alright very good and that s a great way to start into the next part what we re going to use the lizards for today alright so what i would like to know from you guys is everybody has a bucket on their table right um hum yeah teacher okay and you can raise your hand for this part how can you from your seat how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket anthony shoot it you can shoot it you can just toss it in you can just toss it in there you could pull its tail you could pull its tail and stretch it you could drop it in there you could just drop it in there it s not too far away anybody else okay how about and i m not asking for a demonstration yet we ll get to demonstration i promise how about if i asked you guys instead of in the bucket at your table how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor s table at your neighbor s table javious what do you think you could toss it you could toss it arrington you could sling it you could sling it wilson that was your idea alright walk over there and put it in it yeah that s true i didn t say you had to stay in your seat did i you could walk over there and just put it in gavin you could like throw it you might throw it is that what you were going to say dana alright shoot it you could shoot it alright very good you could bend it back yep you could bend it back and shoot very good how about if i asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other jade i ll start with you sling it you could sling it lewis like you said you could shoot it yeah you could shoot it anthony you could throw it you could throw it so we re kind of hearing the same things right we re kind of hearing go ahead you could walk over and drop it you could walk over and drop it i didn t say you had to stay in your seat alright what would be the difference though between the bucket at your table the bucket your neighbor s table shooting it across the room going out on the football field and going for distance what would be the difference between what you did what difference would you have between this bucket here the bucket at your neighbor s table and so forth john what do you think the amount of energy you re putting into it can you just show me without actually shooting it for example like if you re trying to get it into this bucket i only have to go like this or drop it in there if i were trying to send it across the room i d have to really stretch it out okay the distance away from the bucket okay so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance stretch it more i might stretch it further is that what you two were going to say the more potential energy or kinetic energy it has the more potential energy the more kinetic energy it has so when you talk about the lizard what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has how s it getting potential energy what does that mean before you sling it it s just sitting there alright so when it s just sitting there it s potential what about when you stretch it what do you think that is kinetic okay have you let it go yet no alright so we ll think about that for a little bit what i d like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table or if you don t like what they have to say you can think about it on your own i d like for you to make a hypothesis and i d like for your hypothesis to start with i think and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor s table what do you think you would do differently i think if i do what to the lizard it s going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table so make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one by slinging it yeah talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think alright i ll give you but then compare it to the next table as well what would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one that s what i want you to do okay alright so let me just have let s hear one table gavin i kind of liked what i was hearing from yours ready guys gavin i liked what i was hearing from your table when i was walking around tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis that if you were shooting it at your table you d only pull back a little bit but if you re shooting it across to another person s table you d have to pull it back farther okay any other table have a similar hypothesis so their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table and correct me if i m wrong they d only have to stretch it a little bit but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor s table they d have to stretch it further did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that you guys did how about you guys what did you say nicole we said that maybe we d have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables okay so not only the amount of stretch but also the trajectory of how you aim it alright very good how about you guys over there you d have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it alright very good and i know you guys were coming up with the same thing so we re going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly okay so if that s your hypothesis i think the amount of stretch that i give the lizard will make it fly a different length what would the manipulated variable be what would the thing be that you change between the different steps anthony how far you pull it back how far you pull it back very good how far you pull it or can i put stretch also good what would our dependent variable be what are you going to watch for how do you know if that stretch has made a difference jada alright very good and where else might it go right but you re talking about your bucket and you re also talking about very good so we re talking about distance alright so can i put that down for the dependent yes okay good how about some constants what are some things that have to stay the same guys don t let that table do all the work come on now alright ada the type of lizard the type of lizard very good would it be fair if i gave one table battery powered and the other table not right alright very good sierra what else the size and shape of it size and shape of it very good anything else that has to stay constant or the same how big is the container alright very good how big is the container wilson how stretchy it is okay how stretchy it is alright i m going to give you 30 seconds and what i would like for you to do with those 30 seconds is i d like for you to practice alright i d like for you to practice at this point just at your table if you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end that s fine but i would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area okay alright go ahead without hitting your neighbor maybe move to the side kendra go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference gavin see if you have some information when you re done besides that it sticks to your neighbor s head alright hold on and we ll try it again i promise we ll try it again at further distances in just a minute let s think guys can anyone make a conclusion that starts with when i change the amount of stretch can anyone make a conclusion that starts good job nicole when i change the amount of stretch if i change the amount of stretch far then it goes further okay if i change the amount of stretch when i make it further it goes further alright lewis you might plan for it to go one way but the way that you shoot it really it doesn t exactly go where you plan it s all over the place but if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance,0.0
so you re saying here why did you pick it why did you pick the two points that you did okay why are they random no you just tell me why you think those two what okay average okay so i ll come back here in a minute i m gonna tend to this table what okay what is i don t know what i would there cause they have the what is the all right what is and what is you guys it should say what is the slope okay it should say what is the slope it represents the y intercept yeah it said what is the that s what i m saying people all right i m just sayin it would okay three can i have your attention real quick please all right once you find i see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept okay because that ll help you with question number three okay then i ve got through question number three go head and find your answer and here we have what is this linear okay is that a line no okay were you supposed to draw a line through it okay what does it say down there okay why you did number five before you did number one it said draw a line through right this is like a not a line okay a line is straight so you wanna draw a line straight through there but before you do that i want you to answer and do one two three and four first should we erase this uh yeah but don t worry about it right now i want you to work on finding a what two points did you have um okay and why did you get that because what s easy mean like one plus one and what kind of slope did you get oh you haven t done it yet okay i ll get back to you all right but 72 s what s number two what is the slope what is the slope value what is the slope what is the slope and then i was gonna i actually had started out with what doesn t mean in a situation but when you y equals one and x yep okay y 1x now how do we find what s the ordered pair here okay that s the slope intercept form oh that s what got em mixed up so what is it though and you don t have point slope what is the ordered pair for y intercept is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that s like no that s point slope okay i just want the y intercept okay 2 is the y intercept in this equation y mx b right it s two what did that tell me that s what the y intercept is what does it represent the situation okay now wait it s okay is it for two people so is for people okay now if you were to look at your graph which we haven t done yet and where would negative two cross though i m not sure that s now i m also seeing something here about why do you have a two here hello so 30 32 i know right making me erase that s okay so it s three six nine 12 then all this other junk so you can get up there and get 33 always thinkin six is six eight is eight i m sorry three seconds for every how many people for each person three seconds a person okay no that s person according to your data so it took three seconds to pass from the church right now what is minus 24 okay that s a year you have y intercept is negative 24 and it represents okay i want you to do one graph okay yeah whatever your y is starting at by the way this is a they want you to draw a line okay so what is time in seconds right where does the y intercept it crosses x okay it crosses x the y intercept crosses the y intercept crosses y okay the y intercept crosses the y okay so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what okay all right it s crossing talking about time okay it s supposed to say what is the slope the slope is wards for s you should move your line so that it follows the dots okay i m gonna come back here what s the problem time they re confusing me all right so number three you said the y intercept is six elevenths of a second is that what you re saying six elevenths seconds okay and you said that was what okay all right what were the people doing people were passing books so six elevenths okay means that it took six elevenths were no people what was happening during each person to pass so was each person passing the book at six elevenths that s how long it took for them to start passing six elevenths of a second okay so who passed the first globe i mean who s was that angela okay so he did what he had to run around and then to come back and here and turn a person right he had to leave his desk okay now is that an average throw okay what s your average that you re talking about 14 seconds for every 11 men okay so we might wanna just change that to a decimal okay so just find out how many for one person just change it to a decimal and you might wanna change six elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual okay that s great all right that s okay does everybody understand what jade was saying i think the reason why she did that was because we had to make a line okay now okay that doesn t mean make a line graph oh okay are you drawing a straight line a straight line now we just wanna look at what you got here okay what did you put one one and what does it mean i got 1 27672767 okay and what does the slope on the line now don t worry about your line right now just answer these questions what does the slope on the line your slope of one represent in this situation one second per pass okay all right you re gonna do one second per pass averaged per person one second per person to pass the book get back right okay so what does your y intercept represent if it s at zero with no passage that s what the seconds are that s what the point is okay say that again if there s no passes like the time starts at negative two seconds i guess i don t know how to explain did you get a negative yeah now is that possible no no okay why might you have a negative sometimes it drops okay but if you have negative time okay can you she d be like oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago yeah negative no that was three seconds ago but it wasn t so you got a point two right seconds all right now let s just think about and you said it was what negative two seconds but he wrote people okay when was there a time when there was zero people i mean in this situation during the book pass when was there zero time never when it s when okay when they start moving but somebody was moving i think it s zero passes no all right what does your y line represent time in seconds time in seconds so the y intercept rounded out that s what time in seconds right so it s a time when was time when the books were not being passed somebody had to all right walk over and pick em up and then somebody had to walk over and put them,0.0
okay you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday what we realized or what i realized is that there s still confusion on going from the general to factor general to vertex or vice versa on any of those three particular forms also another objective we re gonna do is we re gonna figure out determine why each form is important so the first thing i want you guys to do is i want you guys to look at number one on that task card can someone read it out loud i will yeah drew the angry bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters the bird s initial velocity was 14 7 meters per second write an equation that gives the height of the angry bird as a function of time okay so what i need you guys to do is i need you guys to write that equation on the white board okay so now i want people to put it up on the board okay okay so can you guys look around to each other too i know you guys are gonna want to like show everybody what people are getting yay cool okay guys these are the four things or the three things that i saw okay so right here so if you notice a lot of you guys you guys had the first one negative four point nine x squared plus 14 7 x plus 49 can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out you just did it what was the question so can someone tell me how like relate this general formula to the story since you ve read already i wants someone else to speak so who okay jamilah can you explain how you were able to get this equation so the height is c and the original equation is a x squared plus b x plus c and so the initial height is b which is the y intercept and then b is the initial velocity and then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose so you guys is it random no it s the scale factor is there any other terminology for that it s the starting point hey guys do you think it s the starting point is it the starting point or what else it s gravity so wait what does this negative four point nine mean that s the constant remember it s gravity so i heard scale factor okay scale factor but relatively to your projectile motion what is it acceleration acceleration so you guys it s acceleration so right now what i want you guys to do oh actually once again right here here are different forms of an equation that i saw so right here what do you think can someone tell me what s wrong with this particular one they don t have a squared and they don t have an x after the 4 2 okay so ravelle what s the problem with this one there s no y intercept or so once again i still notice now i want to go back to the original equation okay someone tell me in words ah jamilah she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a x squared plus b x plus c but according to the story can someone refer to the story back to the general equation can you rephrase the question yes how are we able to get 14 7 here how did we get 49 here how do you know what stuff to use the 49 is the initial height in meters so that one s gonna be your y intercept and 14 7 is the initial velocity and the initial velocity is always b so awesome so now what i want you guys to do is i want you to go to number two so i want you to put that on the white board can i read it again well actually no let s have fatima can you read number two what does the x axis represent in this story what does the y axis represent in our story okay let s do that quickly i have a question yes did x never mind i ll wait until after this so let s look around so a lot of people are getting what x equals time y equals height so markeisha what was your question i was gonna say could x be distance as well can x be distance people no no if it wanted to why not because it s meters per second not meters per so does that make sense all right so now what i want you guys to do so so far let s recap what we ve done so far can everyone generalize what we ve just done in the first couple of questions we set up the equation and we figured out our x and y axes in the general form okay right now what i want you guys to do is i want you guys to work on number four okay someone read that out loud that hasn t read out loud yet i haven t so leslie you want to read number four from the equation that you got from question number one show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form now what i want you guys to do i want you to turn and talk about the strategies you re planning to use to work out this problem okay you guys i m gonna stop class real quick you guys i m gonna stop class real quick okay so mary can you just ask the question that you just asked me she asked me okay so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about so markeisha jamilah can we use the box to figure it out yeah you can why how hang on put that back away so you guys so the question is okay so autumn just asked can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to and why you guys you guys let s listen please mary sorry you figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers so if you divide negative four point nine x squared by negative four point nine you ll get x squared 14 7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three and then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten okay i ll stop you right there so back to what i said okay so the diamond rectangle method people so when you are doing this what are you finding we re finding the box you re finding the box so what are those things outside of the box here what are they called the factors the factors okay okay when you re using it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula what are you trying to find then all right so right now so autumn so you have questions on that right so later on so do you mind just moving over there real quick because leslie said that you got it down so you guys so take two more minutes we re gonna see both methods so are you done yet no okay you guys stop okay right now i m gonna put this up right here we re gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do okay so right now so how many people got negative five and two no no no so what was it negative two oh okay i got negative two and five my bad okay so right now what do you think was the mistake that she did she didn t square it she didn t what she didn t square and then she re fixed it she fixed it yeah she copied mine it s supposed to be negative 14 7 is that what its supposed to be yeah and is that what she s missing yeah okay guys so that s one mistake that happens quite a bit also let s look at hey you guys what form is this right here what method did they use box and diamond method box and diamond method right okay so you guys what do you call these two items right here what is it missing the number at the beginning the negative four and what is that again what is the name of the four point nine again scale factor or what acceleration acceleration so you guys if you notice this is something that tends to be missing also so now we will look at ah we have the same thing we all have the same thing so same thing same thing all right okay so right now i think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend oh actually so now what i want is so how many methods do people use two okay so tell me one what was one method what was the method that you used quadratic formula okay caleb what was another method that people used the box and diamond the box and diamond right so right now i want people to explain their thinking so what i want you to do is okay since tiffany since you said you did the quadratic formula you re gonna go up and talk about it just talk about the process of what you did how are you gonna explain the process all right so the can we do it on this hard board yeah okay let s do it on this hard board make sure you talk to us okay okay while you re writing things down talk about how you re going through the process so i used the quadratic formula so what are you doing right now i m writing it writing what the quadratic formula okay so you see instead of me asking i just want you to explain all the things that you re doing okay so you guys need some visuals this will be your a your b and your c so you plug all this into this okay so let s do it i have a question yes what if the b is already negative that s a good question so you guys while tiffany is doing the quadratic formula think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier and what mistakes that she may or may not have,0.0
do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt do i get a lot now you get what you can t do anything down here you need to help him roll that out he s going to need help right there you can put one in one side and then pull it down through there one right there when in doubt put a button if you re wondering if it should be in there it should be we re a little far apart right here you definitely need to put one right here so it s under reach down right here and put one in this back end going to um wrinkle before you put a nail there can i nail the top part of this yes absolutely because if i your feet need to be on a button regardless on which side you re on you need to be on the button please nail that one right behind you this sun coming out like this makes this felt hot hot and soft and it ll tear easily now this is 30 pound felt it s not 15 pound felt so it s a lot thicker than what you got two common kinds you re going to be putting on okay okay how are we doing over here if you lay it up there the top won t fly down that s right that s good communicate communicate with each other right there did that work out work for you yeah stand this way how many rinds do we need you got your left rind now we need our interval going up to the roof tell us what it is what you need to do on a three tab how far what is our interval here remember can you remember what is it speak up five five five inches okay don t be scared you know it you shout it right out five inches five inches up every five inches be sure to measure from the top of the seam don t measure from here it s got to be from right here measure up five 10 15 20 just go ahead and mark it up you re roof get your layout there and your layout there double check each other check behind each other if the layout s not right and we have to tear shingles back off are those shingles any good no what no sir they re not any good let s make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct remember team work just like on the job anybody can make a mistake you have a couple of eyes on it checking behind that s a lot better you can mark on this side it s not going to hurt a thing you can put a bigger mark on there so you can see it alright something like that okay you can see that that s not small and tiny that s big look at the difference right here enrique my marks and your marks right here you can especially i mean this is relatively new felt this felt gets marked up and scratched up if you put a large crow foot mark on here you re going to know exactly where to hold that thing make sure that you get it where you can see it we re going to cover this stuff right back up now watch this felt as i pull this up and down see those bubbles in it right here i got the bubbles at the top that means i gotta pull it down to get those out you want this stuff laying flat if it doesn t it ll probably show up underneath the machinery if i pull it down too far it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom so you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it i ve got them out and i m just a little bit below my line right here but that s okay it s more important that this is out right here that it s on does that make sense yeah so just make sure now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here don t forget our nailing pattern that we discussed here here here here and here you can feel right here where the plywood is you want to put a button right here and your nail line is going to be right in here on this you don t want to nail into the fascia board you want to come right across in here and put them every six inches and about every two feet right here and one occasionally be careful not to step on the felt step on the buttons so you don t end up sliding just be careful anytime that you re stepping on felt you never want to step on loose felt okay all right go ahead and nail that off this one right here see how you re doing this shingle yeah we re gonna come back with a starter right here turned upside down this right here is gonna have to be cut off so go ahead and just cut this off even that ll be fine right now this one over here don t nail that yet hold on just a second come here a minute you can do it that way that s one way that you can run it down and cut it or right here i can just take this soldier just like this and i can cut it off right here or i can just lap it up there and nail it like it is the other soldier is coming down to right here so just come up here and cut this off got your hook weight on you yeah take and cut one tab off of the shingle flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there it doesn t have to be straight right i just cut it pardon does it have to be straight just eyeball it no it doesn t have to be perfectly straight just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back that ll be fine hold it down there you go never cut back on your handle these right here we ll be able to use for the caps on top so don t throw these away tabs always go in on these so make sure your tab s in flush it up and nail it off once you ve done this you need to pull a layout and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles if we re gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull thirty 36 we re gonna pull 36 inches and we re gonna pull 30 inches top and bottom topping your lines all right does that make sense yeah okay so do that once you nail this off do that and then run your starters you can go ahead and cut that off the inches right here you can go ahead and cut them come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute you got a hook blade y all have it you go ahead and do that then you can do the other side right here go ahead and get your lines snapped put them on there and mark it and pop your lines either way you can do it either way it doesn t matter but since we re gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway flush it up and hang it don t pull that down if you do that s just gonna take and break that shingle off this right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building so we want our finished shingles to come right here also when you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist go ahead and mark that at the top you need to keep them moving you gotta have it marked up there go ahead and mark it up there and mark it right here get these popped and then you can go ahead and get darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y all will be ready to put these things on put your starter on it here thirty and 36 it s raining buttons see that button landed right there y all make sure that you pick these things up when you re done you should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem once they get right here you can t nail it move down the line hammering talk to him what do you want him to do put a nail right there there you go brandon is telling you right y all hold on a minute what does putting a nail right there do i mean you re about to put it right there it holds it center because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up it s gonna hold it right keeps it straight so really you can start putting buttons from down there to here it s not going to affect anything because he s got that button in from this point on we can t put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here he nails it off right but you could nail this go ahead and start doing that working together as a group to get the job done is what it s all about this is not a one man job you can t roll this stuff out and do it by yourself it s not a one person job if you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there s nothing wrong with doing that what you don t want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there watch about cutting back towards your hand like that just be real careful there ya go mike put your hand on that roll for him i got it that may not be enough to cap that ridge off so we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to you need a button in it now he needs help help him right here yes sir where at hold on come on the line right there yeah come on right here is that on right yeah next put the felt right here as far as starting this next row you got a line on thirty six inches you got a line on 36 inches and you ve got a line on 30 inches we want to make sure that when you start this next run that you re not breaking let me see a shingle right here i want you to watch i ve worked on several houses the whole boxing fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house the reason for that was this right here they put their starter on like you re supposed to to allow for the throats of the shingles we have no water penetration down here but once you start this starter tabs up over to your 36 inch line if i laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off i have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt this felt will only hold for so long it s going to get down here it will rot it out and there you re gonna be so you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then give me one more shingle then when you butt this shingle up to this one now what i have is i got my break right here in the center of the full tab and i m six inches away from it that s why our nailing pattern here is important you want to nail above every throat in the far line slightly above in a three tab shingle four nails 1 2 3 4 just like we discussed on the powerpoint above the tar line pardon above the tar line i can t hear you above the tar line it can be in or slightly above most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them your video powerpoint was slightly above but the main important thing here is that you have it to where if you put them in random if i put one right here or in the middle of these two i could possibly have a nail where i got a shingle breaking or i could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that s gonna line up on top of the next one it s important to go here here here and here the purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don t take and blow it up and rip the shingle off so it melts down it ll actually seal and melt down to it all right you re doing good but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut so use a shingle to square it up or your speed square mark your line and cut it straight down right here you can nail it on first that will be fine or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it you see this shingle right here that s got the little slit in it that is exactly six inches is what that is so you can take this shingle right here put your speed square up here take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that either way there s multiple different ways to do it the main thing is don t just take this put it on the 30 inch line nail it down and don t do anything else to it until you get up there y all do it as you go these hot days like this cool that down and it won t get it s form back it ll look bad so we want to keep it looking good all right how we doing good good what about right here you need to put it along the edge if you don t follow along the edge there s three buttons if you started one at the top one at the bottom what s missing one in between so let s get them in there jake you mind getting that one is that going to be enough to roll all this if not we ll get another roll and finish it out just go ahead and run with what you got that ll be okay that will lay down beneath be careful about the top edge of that felt run that y all can stand on this get a couple more buttons in between here we re a little far apart right here i like to see two foot go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button get you a couple more in the middle and then cap that off lay it right down the center,0.0
that s a start ok devon and sasha 3 1 3 what are the classifications natural no not natural rational yes rational real yes ok it s rational and it s real now brian you had first said natural yeah i kinda because a fraction isn t natural ok right a fraction is not natural who else can tell us something about natural numbers then what do we know about our natural numbers they re the counting numbers yeah ok counting numbers what do we mean by that the counting numbers numbers that you count with like one two three ok our natural numbers are our counting numbers so 3 1 3 again was just a rational rational and a real ok very good somebody else ok go ahead natalie square root of 19 what are the classifications rational hold on one second thank you can you show us your number so the square root of 19 ok irrational it s irrational i decided it s irrational cause it s the square root of a nonperfect number nonperfect square nonperfect square ok so sasha and christina both agree that it s irrational and christina what else did you say i m not sure if they heard it s a nonperfect square ok it s not a perfect square and it s also real ok it is irrational and we wanna remember that an irrational number is also a real number even though it doesn t end or repeat how did you know without using your calculator that the square root of 19 was an irrational number it doesn t make a perfect square ok and how do you know it doesn t make a perfect square because i have no idea if you multiply two numbers you don t get it ok very good that s exactly right you actually can multiply two numbers to get 19 it s just a decimal or yeah it s an irrational decimal it s an irrational decimal ok so you can multiply and we looked at an example of that we did a little activity with the square root of 19 is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply to get 19 mm mmm and that s what makes it irrational compared with if you did like the square root of 16 what two numbers can you multiply to get four and four four and four ok good ok how bout another number go ahead the classifications of 1 3 rational and real ok rational real anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1 3 mm hmm the greater the decimal it s repeating right it s a repeating decimal it doesn t end but it does repeat ok so if it were if it was you could get a rational number right and that makes it a rational number very good ok we looked at several numbers how about someone ask a question someone wanna throw in a question ok go ahead scotty what integers are also whole numbers ok what integers and let s make sure everybody s having the opportunity to answer questions repeat that again what integers are also whole numbers ok so what integers are also whole numbers two can be a whole and an integer ok what did you say first two ok two is an example it can be an integer and a whole number positive numbers positive numbers ok our positive numbers negative numbers could be too can negative numbers be whole numbers though no no it can zero ok zero positive numbers ok who remembers what example did i give you when we re thinking about whole numbers pets what can help you think about whole numbers pets ok sasha says pets who can elaborate on what that means the number of pets you have count the number of pets you have and then we asked for a number or something they wouldn t say like i have 3 4 of a dog or something ok so if you d ask somebody how many pets they have their answers are always gonna be what a whole number a whole number which and what are our whole numbers zero one zero to infinity zero through all the way ok mm hmm zero and all alright good good question scotty let s have another question go ahead luke is a negative number rational or irrational ok turn that around so we can see so is a negative number can it be classified as rational or irrational it would be a rational number no a negative number is a rational number it would be both yeah it would be both if you have the square root of a negative number it s an integer take the square root of a negative number an integer is always rational so an integer is rational and a negative number is a is rational but his question let s see that again is a negative number so it could be rational can we have a negative number that s irrational can somebody give me an example of that negative pi ok negative pi mm hmm the negative square root of two ok the negative square root of a number would the negative have to be on the outside or the inside of the pi outside the pi i mean outside the square root sign so luke can you conclude us what was your answer to that question sometimes both ok it can be both mm hmm good alright good question too what about another number what s another number madison go ahead the square root of 144 ok the square root of 144 who can give us the different classifications real ok damian says real natural natural whole whole integer yeah integer any others rational ok it s rational do you agree madison yes ok very good so we looked at when that s if we look at our graphic organizer when it starts here with natural we read this going out that it has all those different classifications good ok how about another number go ahead amy what is the difference between these two numbers the negative square root of nine and the square root of negative nine ok i like that question so what s the difference between those two so on the first example we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign and then we see it on the inside one s real and one s not ok damian says one s real and one s not when it s in the inside it s not real because you can t take the square root of a negative number exactly we cannot take the square root of a negative number so when we see it on the inside there s not a solution to it what about when it s on the outside you can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign ok so what would that answer be negative square root of nine negative three right negative three let s talk a little bit more in depth about when that negative is inside the square root why do we not have a solution to that so it was a square root of negative nine because you can t multiply two numbers to get a negative right exactly so if we had like the square root of nine what two numbers can we multiply to give us three oh nine three and three three and three and remember how we talked about what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number squaring it mm hmm so there s not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine good alright let s have another number go ahead brock ok 3 14 pi i m glad you showed that number 3 14 that is not pi it s rational and real it s irrational no it s rational it s not rational because it never ends or repeats it is rational yeah but 3 14 ends yes it ends it s 3 14 not pi that s not pi pi doesn t end that one ends pi doesn t end ok so are we all in agreement that the number pi is an irrational number that doesn t end or repeat yes but what is brock s number 3 14 3 14 so that number 3 14 ends it ends so what are the classifications for that number rational and real it s rational and real now when we re working problems like area or circumference of a circle why do we use 3 14 because it s easier because it s easier right could we use a whole number for pi to do a calculation no no way it s gonna end right it would never end so when we re doing our calculations we use that 3 14 but brock i m glad you had that number so you know there s that difference pi doesn t end but just 3 14 does end mm hmm square root of negative 41 ok can you show everyone your number so the square root of negative 41 not real ok not a real number but if it was real then and they were on the outside then it d be irrational wouldn t it ok and why would that be irrational the square root of 41 mm hmm no two numbers that can multiply not the same two whole numbers let me ask you a question about the square root of 41 what if your neighbor came and said i d like for you to help me make a fenced in area for my dog and i want it to be a square and i want the area to be 41 how would you maybe respond to your neighbor make it 49 ok cause it wouldn t be a square it wouldn t be a perfect square if it was 41 ok so you what did you say damian to make it like 41 so you could have a seven by or 49 so you could have seven by seven ok good or make it a six by six 36 ok i would tell him to make it way bigger because a dog needs a lot of space no that wouldn t actually be a very big area would it no that would be small unless maybe it was a small dog yes a really small dog like a teacup chihuahua ok how about another question oh ok are repeating decimals ever fractions no yes 1 3 so you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction yeah 1 3 ok 2 6 it s a bunch of threes yes ok 1 3 definitely that was the number damian had a bunch of threes and you said now two what about 2 6 it s repeating also ok cause that will reduce back to what 1 3 1 3 ok alright how about another number ethan square root of two alright i don t know if you can see that but the square root of two what if you try to take the square root of two it s irrational irrational ok it s an irrational number but it s also a real real number good alright another number that we can look at maybe someone who s not answered down here nicole five divided by zero oh that s a good one we ve not had that how about five divided by zero it s not real that s not real ok not a real number again can we go a little bit further why is that not a real number because there s no longer a number you can multiply by it s zero anything divided by zero is not a real number ok i had several of you talking and i do want to hear everyone what did you say natalie it s undefined ok we do say that s undefined michael could you add to that you can t divide anything by zero ok you can t divide anything by zero and if you look on the overhead if i were to write that out and put five inside as our dividend and zero as our divisor is there a number i can multiply by zero to get five no cause anything times zero is zero so that makes it undefined ok very good ok another number ooh ooh ok cliff go ahead and then brock you had your hand raised i ll come back to you the square root of 53 ok hold that up so everyone can see ok we have the square root of 53 classifications for square root of 53 irrational irrational and real and real very good ok brock how about your number ok the square root of a prime number is always what ok brock s given us a question can you repeat that again the square root of a prime number is always what oh that s a very good question irrational ok so if it s a prime number and you re trying to take the square root it s always irrational ethan you said irrational can you expand on that i said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number you have to have two for it to be a perfect square you have to have two numbers prime numbers and you have one and the number itself ok only those two factors right ok very good ok maybe another question mm hmm is a repeating decimal rational or irrational so if it s a repeating decimal rational rational yes ok very good how about another question that we could discuss madison true or false a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats it s false ok it s false what does that mean mariah if it s terminating it so if it terminates it it ends it ends right exactly ok how about another number anyone an example we ve not had many with integers i see you how about one with a negative number anybody have one with a negative number brian you do ok i have the square root of negative 225 not real ok not real again why is that not a real number because it s negative the decimal s inside ok well not the decimal is inside but the negative the negative s inside i wanna throw a number out how about negative 4 5 for the number negative 4 5 rational yeah rational ok it s a rational number and it is a real number is it a negative number yes no yeah no hmmm so negative 4 5 wouldn t that be considered an integer no because it s not a whole or a natural number ok very good what do we know we haven t talked too much about integers what do we know about our integers how do we classify an integer that it s whole numbers and their opposites ok whole numbers and their opposites and we used our number line in class do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line no so what numbers are not considered integers decimals decimals and fractions ok so if they have that negative sign in front of them then what do we call em if they re not integers,0.0
and your ideas and we re learning from each other right because a lot of times who do we learn from you each other you learn from me but who else do you learn from us you learn from each other okay kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen we re going to watch another weather forecast and as you re viewing this i want you to pay really close attention to how she talks how she speaks okay as a good listener and a viewer what are some things that we need to concentrate on while we re watching this how she her face her expression and how she moves and looks okay and how are you going to find out if she does those things by watching her you re going to be watching her okay sarah watch how her body is moving because watch her eyes okay catch your eye and i like that you said watching what are you doing while you re watching are you just staring at the screen no you are looking at them and you re making eye contact and you re looking you re watching their mouths because there are people who can t really hear so they would read people s mouths and that s really important to do anything else that you can do while you re viewing this listening okay and how are you going to be listening we talked about this a lot how are we going to listen with our ears and with our whole entire bodies with our whole entire bodies why are we going to listen with our whole entire body naomi because if we re listening with our ears then our hands are up here saying oh i ve got something to say then you re not really listening you re not really listening competently all right can you go ahead and hit play for us please yup just like you did yesterday good afternoon i m julie wunder with your forecast a north wind five to ten miles per hour tonight 28 it s going to be partly cloudy out and we can head to a 7 day forecast about a 50 percent chance of rain transitioning over to some snow overnight saturday and into sunday temperatures fall next week what a cold forecast we have coming up at 5 o clock we ll have the latest on that possibility of snow turn and talk to your buddy we re going to do two right here two two two i noticed that under one of the clouds we had snow instead of rain turn your face okay and what kind of body language did she use she was pointing and so why do you think she was pointing like that okay and because you saw her looking at you did that make you listen any differently did it help you listen more or less when she looked away what was she doing alright so why do you think she wasn t doing this okay like you say she was like why is that would you be listening as well if she were making those faces or would you her face right not necessarily what she was saying but you were focusing on her expressions alright guys let s come back in three two and one okay you guys had some amazing things that you saw when you watched this little clip what kind of things did you notice tell me what you and your buddy were talking about we used this chart if she was just like there she was pointing at it so then it made me understand more but if she was just like there when you did your presentation what did you feel like you were looking at my poster you looked at your poster the whole time okay and the second time when you did your presentation again you said you were really focusing on your eye contact were you able to achieve that goal no no why not because i was looking at my poster again you say you were looking at your poster again okay why do you think you did that were you nervous what do you think you could ve done to ease that nervousness take a breath going to take a breath what do you guys think what could adrian have done to maybe be a little less nervous when he was doing his presentation he could think about somewhere he was comfortable okay think about somewhere where s he s comfortable picture everyone else in their underwear oh underwear sarah be himself and just act like it s just any other day the information we were presenting was it a little bit more in depth than what we usually talk about what do you think was the topic you were sharing a little bit you have a little bit more information than if you were just sitting here having a conversation yeah so that make some of us nervous that we have a lot of information trying to remember yes and then was anyone able to get over that nervousness okay sarah how were you guys able to get over that nervousness i followed my goals and i just tried to be myself i just followed my goals and i just had fun okay do you want to show us part of your presentation where you did that mhmm avril will you move the book away from the projector while she gets the computer ready alright make sure you get to a spot where you can see got it my project is about legends of the i m going to start over with werewolves people think that i don t know why because wolves howl at the moon this is a werewolf a full moon is sometimes called a wolf s moon since its yellow this one is my favorite it s about she calls her brother helius to find her sister herse the study of geography to the moon is called selenology okay this is this is vampires vampires are said to come out on every moon except for new moon i guess because they can see better this is a vampire person trying to get his girlfriend to become a vampire this is people people think to people that are aggressive and violent this is a witch from okay turn to your buddy for a second do you think she was able she said she acted like she was comfortable like it was just any other day yeah talk to your buddy about that do you think that she accomplished that goal yes because she s a pretty funny girl right alright let s come back together let s come back together please alright so her goal she said that she wanted to be more comfortable and she was just going to act like it was any other day did she accomplish that yes okay how do we know that she accomplished that what do you think arizona because she was really comfortable with her surroundings and those people just wanted to get their talking over with and done but sarah actually talked like we were just talking face to face acting like the camera wasn t even there okay and as a listener how did sarah s confidence make you listen better did it make you listen better or did it not make you listen better it did okay why did it make you listen better levin because it was fun because it was fun okay and what made it fun she was acting like the way she was acting the way she was acting okay what did you think dillon because she s usually funny and she was being quite funny on this okay and i like to yup alright anybody else what were some other goal that you guys created sit up and join the circle please alright let s see someone i haven t heard from yet isabelle what was one of your goals one of my goals was to stop making really distracting movements because i was like twisting it and twirling it and i was really nervous alright so that was the first time you did your presentation you felt you were doing too many movements yeah and so your goal was to cut down on that and why did you choose that as a goal really when we watched my first video we decided that she said that she was kind of watching that and she couldn t really have her attention stay on what i was saying and did you agree with her mhmm okay so what did you do with your second presentation i really was concentr,0.0
we started testing out our theory that it s an exponential cause we found out that the ratios does that verify that it s an exponential equation we thought it did but it doesn t so why aren t you sure i don t know so the more disks i add i m eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that i can make isn t that a logistic function so logistic function would say that you re gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make and it would say at some point you re gonna slow down the number of moves you re adding on does that make sense based on what you ve done so far no not at all what do you think is gonna happen instead that it would increase and what would that be that s the exponential but the numbers are all really long decimals so i heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this so have you looked at your scatter plot yes okay what might be other ways to change an exponential function i can get it out of my backpack based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio before you did any of the arithmetic what did you think your ratio might be small i don t know i didn t really think it was two automatically but two s in your head why is two in your head because doubling because there s doubling here s what i m gonna suggest to you guys you ve got your scatter plot on marissa s calculator right you re thinking that two might have been the ratio why don t you graph two y equals two to the x and compare it to what s happening on your scatter plot and see if there s a different way that you might be able to change the extremum it s increasing by a factor of 2 she s trying it in an actual game normally i d want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds we re at 20 so what s your goal 27 28 29 30 31 good job caitlyn good job now i m convinced that that works you re seeing that the difference is doubling each time correct what kind of function is that suggesting exponential and what do you suspect is probably your factor two two so that s what i want you to look at how could you verify that it s an exponential function using any of the tools you have here once you ve found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is there is a little bit of a trick to this one it has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions okay figure out that when you get stuck again let me know and i ll be back so you think that s two to the power of x minus one why did you get minus one because with one it worked fine but with two when you try to put in x as the exponent two to the x so two times two is four so far x minus 1 is the exponent what i m hearing is that you re convinced that the factor is two and you re trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here is that correct talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you re adding the one at the end because there has to be at least one move we added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first oh wait that doesn t work though if you have one so two to the zero is 1 and one plus one is two but that s tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end you said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one is it a piece of the function that would be really mean we were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end i think you guys are in a great place i think you ve got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table so try more with the transformation i also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move but i would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves that s just that you need at least one move alright i m going to leave you guys to think i ll come back so we found the equation but now we re stuck at number four okay so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it the difference between i was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference so how it would relate to the y values we saw the two to the x we figured oh well two to the four to the 16 well how do we get to 15 minus one this is going back to the algebra from last year so you saw that you had two to the x you noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra you also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot did it lie directly on your scatter plot no so what do you mean by it matched up it was close it was the same curve so how did you know that created a transformation because whether it depends on the number or which value it is it changed the steepness of it so we just knew it transformed it somehow like we had to have it it wasn t the parent function so what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x how did you know that because if you d done four times two to the x you would have stretched it because it would have moved to the left too on the graph and what did that end up doing to your y intercept okay so that would be my next question for you i agree with you guys that definitely there s a transformation i agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables you ve done a nice job with that so how does a transformation what you ve done is you ve taken two to the x what does the minus one do does that move this to the left move it up or down well if you graph it it moves it up okay so jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function and you re saying that you don t think the slope changes okay so you change the y intercept and do you have a change in the y intercept it s still zero comma zero so you just had two to the x find out just two to the x what s the y intercept of the graph what happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that the y intercept moved down and does that match what we ve been talking about you take the function and subtract the value and move down one alright you guys said you were stuck on number four yeah okay why are you stuck so we figured out that you put but the minus one doesn t do anything yeah the numbers are so big that it doesn t matter it actually does change the actual number a little teeny tiny bit but our calculator can t see that number it looks like the same number on your calculator so we have a number of moves if each move is a second then how long is it gonna take for the world to end alright now you guys are also at the challenge question down here which is based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made okay and i ll be back in a little bit i m going to give you guys about seven more minutes you should answer question four before you try that so i got it kind of close looking at just i did what you do to find a normal exponential equation i plugged in y two over y one and then to the square root of four and are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours no you guys are correct that this is exponential but if we re not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation is on the right track so i really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values okay i m gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have alright what have you guys got our answer was 30 talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works i realized that the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one so you just have that in your head did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head we didn t graph it we used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one went to the table and it was the same numbers and i noticed here you ve got 2 to the 64th minus one what s that for that s from another number it s like a really high number one point eight times two to the 19th while you guys figure out how long it s gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number i d also like you to think about the answer to the challenge you guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved so i d like you to think about why your function has two to the x why are you doubling those,0.0
you each have your own set and i m going to ask you to put them out in front of you in in so you can see all the words can we put them in two rows one two three four five six let s put them in two rows one two three four five six now i wanna play wait a minute show me i m going to ask you to point so get your pointer finger in show me under yes under good take a look at the word under good wait keep it there show me now be careful we want to get all the letters show me there listen to the word good jessica there that s okay he s gotta look he s gonna do it very good put it down good ready alright be careful with this one listen to my words ready show me saw good excellent alright show me ready they alright excellent alright show me was wow that s good show me want alright now you did a great job now we re going to hide your words so turn your cards over all by yourself now you can t see them right keep them in the rows good alright keep them in a row alright now oh your going to do it that way okay wait a minute now now we re going to take turns let s see who s sitting nicely alright you re going to turn over a card lewis and tell me what the word is put it down want i want my toys i want my toys yes good you turn over a card oh what s your word under i see the cat under the bed alright lewis turn over another card under oh you got under as well what s your sentence i am hiding under the bed i am hiding under the bed that s a good one under the table let s see jessica go ahead do another one now think look at your letters was yes i was eating i was eating good look at your letters let them help you don t help they there there yes there is my toy in the bed there is my toy in the bed okay alright how about you jess oh what do you have there good can you use it there is a car in my mail there is a car in your mail wow that would be interesting alright lewis your turn now look at your letters let them help you they yes they was a cat in my car okay this there was a cat in my car they tried to get the cat out of the car okay they belongs means people they okay let s see what you have oh look at you today is the day aaah this word is they the children that would be they let s take a look at this word this is one we are misunderstanding they jessica and lewis they came to the reading group okay they had turkey for thanksgiving they have alright they came to my birthday they came to my birthday can you think of a sentence for they they what did your brothers do they play basketball there you go they play basketball there you go that s better okay you have another card to turn over but it s my turn i got mixed up i got lakers socks you got what nothing say that again what did you say about the i got socks no this is saw this is i saw you when i i saw a movie i saw a big alligator i saw a big alligator i saw a dinosaur i saw a dinosaur last one was was okay where was my friend where was my friend good i want candy i want candy okay now watch what i m going to do i m going to put the cards together i m going to mix them up and i m going to turn them over we re going to play our matching game okay alright what happened my brother put gum in there and when i point i can t get out of there oh boy alright now jessica you went first before right so we have lewis go first this time would that be fair yes alright lewis you re going to turn over a card you re going now listen to me listen to me this is how we re going to play you re going to turn over a card and you re going to read it then you re going to turn over another card then you re going to read it wait a minute wait a minute if look at me sweetie if you get a match you want to keep the pair you have to put the word in a sentence can you do that let s see go ahead okay take a look take a look take a look shh don t tell him don t tell him was this word is was let s see okay now pay attention jessica so you can remember where they are your turn pick another card lewis oh it s so close what word is this saw saw okay here is was turn it over turn it over and here s saw good okay jessica s turn want good want she read it they not a match good wait a minute wait a minute wait before you do that wait before you do that they want they want candy okay watch lewis who remembers what was this one what was this one no peeking do you remember what it was jessica was was good what was this one saw what was this one they and what was this one want good alright they no its not they careful take another close look look at the whole word there now sorry about that good good they is it a match is that a match no but we ve seen that word what s this word they go to your chair now and sit okay there and they i m going to hide them again now let s see if jessica remembers they and they okay now stop you want to use it in a sentence let s see how we do they have a dog they have a dog good job alright you get that one okay lewis let s see how you do go ahead you can do it oh what s that word under under pick another one under no way alright under okay let s see a nice sentence i m going to listen for a good one i am under my brother can t find me because i m under the table your brother can t find you because you re under the table can you give me a sentence for under um i hide under the bed i hide under the bed excellent okay now it s jessi oh want do you remember where it was jessica wow now wait a minute let s see if you can think of a sentence jessica first i want a cake i want a cake what would you want i want a brownie i want a ice cream okay okay alright try another one oh is that match no no what s this word lewis they come back over here and take a good look at it this word is saw jessica s going to get it now wait a minute maybe not maybe not saw uh eh eh ah uh was was okay yeah but that s okay those two we mixed up let s take a good close look at them which one is was which one is saw okay alright now listen to your first sound i m going to hide them again let s see if we can remember go ahead lewis your turn was and which one was there you go was give me a sentence for was i was in my bed i was in my bed let s hear jessica s sentence for was i was i was in the bus i was in the bus alright let s see pick another one take a look at the first letter saw okay and what s that one saw okay now a sentence for saw wait a minute before you count your card a sentence for saw i saw something you see oh i saw a saw a candy you saw a candy where was the candy on the floor i saw candy on the floor did your little brother dump it on the floor okay i would eat it you have the last one they it s not they i want you to think again look at all the letters don t tell him don t tell him there okay give me a sentence wait a minute give me a sentence with it there was a huge table there was a huge table where in my kitchen there was a huge table in my kitchen before you count your cards can you give me a sentence with the word there there is a snowman at the window there is a snowman on the window what a great sentence how many cards do you have one two three four five six seven i got six alright we re going to do one more thing with these words to practice we have a word that we are having trouble with we re going to come over here over to the board we re going to take a look at this word that we re having trouble with thank you for getting her a marker i m going to ask you to write this word on the board oh a line you know what she s telling you right okay let s take a look at this word are you ready this word is jess that s good alright this word is saw let s see if we can write it saw jessica i want you to write saw look at the word there it is saw okay,0.0
everybody s using their directions they have their tools and their charts out we ve found today s date so we know where we re going to record today it s wednesday march ninth i know what numbers down of zero mean they are negative numbers that s what are numbers that are down from zero ok i have most friends with their hands on their heads i want to make sure everybody s listening and ready to move on we can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them excellent i m waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads so we can concentrate on the teacher in each group i have one team member that will be measuring temperature if you are measuring the temperature please hold up your tool that you ll be using those of you measuring the temperature what tool are you using everybody thermometer very good the people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers please line up at the back door of the classroom when you get out there boys and girls are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there what are you going to have to do look at the thermometer and you can also compare it to the thermometer that s been outside so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside if you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind i would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom you guys can use the compass and work together go ahead out and see what you observe if you have an anemometer to measure wind speed you may line up if you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges you may line up you may all go and last but definitely not least if you are measuring the when we look at this our thingy goes away no yours is 61 no it s the fahrenheit not the celsius there s something in there what team are you 66 you guys we need to wait for how many seconds it s not ready yet you ve been doing it at home what is it that you ve been waiting how can it be 110 how can it be now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around ok so see where your is and get ready to start counting look at the bee i ve heard both of these ladies say two what you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means what is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds look with your eye with one eye look at this one i can t see i think it s going west when you have completed measuring you may walk back to your group to record your data quietly i got 66 can we compare it to what s on the wall there and see what we have it got 66 then it got 65 and then it got 64 victor could you explain it all to me why you think you thermometer keeps going down because it gets colder and where has the thermometer been sitting all day in there and do you think it s cooler out here or is it warmer out here cooler exactly so our temperature is going down good so let s go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that s been staying outside it s getting brown what do we think the temperature is there it says the temperature is 46 degrees that s probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long all right you can head back in and record i don t know which number to choose the one on the outside the whole time what s your gym it s on wednesday march ninth it was west the wind direction was west the wind direction was west very good i think that you have an accurate reading what s the wind speed it s cloudy wind direction temperature team three is working together and team two and team one nice job working together i think you have to change it temperature victor what was the temperature 40 degrees 46 degrees fahrenheit it was 50 what was the wind speed it s not raining so what did you guys think the was i agree with you why would we forecast that it might rain what s the weather the weather is rainy west put west it was west it was west we found out that the wind speed we said it went around about that many times so how fast is the wind actually going minutes miles per hour we don t go anywhere in a minute we travel like we said in cars in miles right go back to your group they ll tell you on the chart my thermometer s higher than the one outside we discussed that while we were standing out there why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you re holding it inside right now because inside of you it s warm because you told us that it was when you re holding the thermometer the thermometer only feels what s around it and if we re covering the thermometer it can t measure any more temperature only how our temperature is very good so linda if that answered your question that s why we compared it to the thermometer that s been staying outside that we check each day what are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there 46 degrees fahrenheit excellent so make sure you re sharing that and each person in your group use your data linda i think you ve done an excellent job ok we have a few minutes left and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments i am going to pass out your follow up questions and you re going to use data from last week and compare it to today s data to do some equations on here and you do not have to finish today we will do this in our follow up lesson in our next science lesson ok you may continue working thank you write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up ok the wind direction who should you be asking that to today s last wednesday the temperature was what is the degrees between today s temperature and the temperature last wednesday write an equation show your work last wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour what is the difference between you already have your paper i know we can do it by ourselves but it says to work as a team i like it good job keep working with your team i hear her saying excellent i like how i see brianna using her data and grace starting to write an equation and abby and samaya have the date on their paper you guys are all doing an excellent job who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went you should ask that person as soon as he comes back he should have his data on his chart what number did you put there we worked together and we figured it out i know this one i know this one i know that one one second,0.0
we are now getting into earth sun and moon interactions we have done one thing well we have done several things all year on that first slide which you copied onto your board what is it the moon phases the moon phases you do the moon phases every day so you should be pretty familiar with moon phases what they are how they happen all that good stuff we get to move on okay let s start with something you do know what is a moon phase tom it s what well it s technically when you look up in the sky and like what light you see in the moon good what light you see in the moon where does the light come from the green she s reflecting the sun the sun how does that work the sun shines on the moon and reflects back good the sun shines on the moon and reflects back so that s how we see the moon do you agree with that i see most of you agree good okay then if we know that it comes from the sun why don t you tell me some of the moon phases so we can build on what you just told me what are some of the moon phases this one should be easy waxing crescent waxing crescent excellent aisha waxing gibbous waxing gibbous very good grillen waning crescent waning crescent bailey full moon full moon tom waning gibbous waning gibbous ramos 1st quarter 1st quarter excellent new moon new moon excellent last quarter last quarter third quarter third quarter and last quarter very good when we talked in the last class some of you said second quarter then the second quarter is half time so that would be what moon phase what s halfway in between first and third what moon phase is that full moon yay full moon yay yeah just start spouting everything out and then eventually you ll be right that works for me yeah it s a full moon get it half full or not okay so we have all these moon phases how can you tell which one s which why don t you just look up and say yay it s a fingernail how do you tell which one s which because different moon phases look different how does it look different because it s okay because different parts of the moon have light on it in different amounts okay different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it how would i be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something you re almost almost there yeah i think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces good very good different kinds of faces one lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side which one lights up on the right side the waxing how do you know that because um well you always told us it s light on the right it s wax iting yeah it s light on the right it s wax iting or what you guys like to do wax on wane off or wane off i don t know wax on okay so i don t have a problem i don t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon i think you guys are pretty set on that how about what causes the phases of the moon what makes that happen you ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun but why would you have parts why wouldn t you just be able to see the whole thing all the time sean because the earth blocks out some of the light that s coming from the moon okay good brenda because the earth rotates with time and when the earth rotates the earth blocks the sun so you can see maybe at the top of the moon okay good tom there are other stars shining in different directions not just the sun okay very good stars shining at different directions anything else nancy because the moon is moving and so okay as the moon moves we see different phases so i hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon the sun from reaching the moon are you in agreeance yeah a little bit yeah yeah somewhat okay here s what we re gonna do you have won the experiment you ve done the flip camera but what i want you to do on your table everybody has like a big lollipop you either have the blue styrofoam ball you have the big white styrofoam ball you have a little styrofoam ball i want you each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls okay and then you are going to come this way down in your light paths you are gonna come up front and gather around my lovely light bulb okay come forth children and you might wanna squat down if you re near the front yay i know it s bright good can t see oh you can t see okay alright oh okay what i want you to do and you re already doing it hold it out in front of you i want you to look at your moon what am i holding in my left hand the sun the light bulb the sun you have the moon yay here hold it out in front of you what moon phase do you have on your moon aisha new moon new moon why is it a new moon because you can t see any light you can t see any light i can see lots of light it s blinding me oh there we go but there s a light source isn t my moon illuminated becky it s illuminated on one side but since you re behind it you don t see any of the light coming well then how do i know it s illuminated because you can see other light oh so i look across from me and i see sean sean you have a full moon now you re supposed to disagree with me and tell me that no you don t oh okay um what moon do you have a new moon no you don t you have a full moon he has a waxing moon no he doesn t he has a full moon you all are crazy look it s illuminated on the other side okay oh yeah you could do that but then wouldn t your head be in line with the earth it doesn t make any sense but that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated not that we have 15 different moons or 28 or however many people we have but just because we re looking at a new moon doesn t mean that the moon s not illuminated it s just the other side so i look across and i can see full moon across from me what else can you see from where you re standing tell me what you see and where you see it yes over there with zack and sarah i see fullmoon okay good over there i see a waning gibbous really i see a waxing gibbous uh becky i see a full moon over at zack nice i see a waxing gibbous with charlese i see a full moon well i see a waxing gibbous why why do you see a waxing gibbous and i see a full moon because we re in different places what s that got to do with anything i thought y all told me that we saw moon phases because the earth s shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon how can we see moon phases then tiffany ooo kaitlyn line of sight line of sight what does that mean um besides your sight in a line it s um well because sunlight s here it looks like a new moon but if the sunlight were like over there it wouldn t huh interesting brooke well i m just suspecting that lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then like i couldn t see a shadow i could only see the new moon oh because oh well oh lauren s head is in the way look at if the earth was in the way that if the earth was in the way would that cause a moon phase yeah is the earth in the way of the moon all the time no what could we call sorry what do we call it when we have the earth and the moon and the sun lined up or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the earth or if the earth is blocking light from getting to the moon bailey an eclipse an eclipse have we talked about an eclipse before a little bit just a little bit so is there anything in between me well is there anything between the moon and the sun in my no no vicinty because if i ask you you re gonna be like yeah lauren s head is in the way she s blocking all the light there s nothing in between me and the light source yet all around you re saying you see different moon phases correct mmm hmm mmm hmm i want you to think about that why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball but there s nothing in between us because the moon and the earth is at a different angle ooh cause the earth is at a different angle because of our position your positions very interesting here s what i m willing to have you do you all have a light bulb some work some don t i know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb so you might have to share but i m gonna have you go back to your seats some of you have three people some of you have four people some of you have two daniel you have three now i want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb where you personally can see four different moon phases or three different moon phases depending on how many people are in your group so you need to be able to see if there are four of you four different moon phases you stand there you hold it and if you get it raise your hand for me now okay that was your challenge you don t have to fill anything you don t have to do anything off you go try not to blow it alright move michael where do you think it s gonna be put it like this okay it doesn t have a switch it s just automatically on and off yay we made it nice are we getting there okay okay since you have four people you re going to position yourselves differently than they are they only have three so you re gonna think think about a clock where on the clock will you put everybody so you can all see four different moon phases from your angle well one can go at twelve twelve twelve six and nine and three like a cross do it i don t think we can put anybody over there and then tell me when you get it we can t put anybody over there so that ll be like twelve this ll be like well we need a camera for it right there we re not using a camera okay well now so brenda can stand there brooke can or we can do like um like this kinda way i ll be here she ll be there and she ll be there and you ll be at the corner yeah okay so take your moon it won t move until you stand there and hold it no i see yours new moon no it looks like a waxing excellent ladies and gentlemen i have a group who has it ooo it looks like i have another group who has it ooo i have another group who has it somebody tell me if you equate it to a clock where are you standing tell me what numbers you re standing on jamie uh oh oh forget about that for one moment we had it she s on number one she s sitting at four on a clock she s nine she s three and six and twelve good so one of the ways you can do it is twelve three six nine you can do it that way or you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides what are you moon phases that you have um that s waxing gibbous waxing gibbous there s full moon new moon and this looks like i see full i see new and then if you re at nine and three i should only be able to see half what would those things be mmm go ahead first and third quarter good first and third quarter i want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it okay something besides those four and you got it too okay we could get a and then someone could be could be right there and right there yeah i see a full moon i see a full moon i just see a full moon because your the light source i see a full moon and a i see a full moon i just see a full moon do you see a half moon here i see a full moon well now do you wanna switch out okay i ll take it okay it s blinding ooo yay oh yeah i see a new moon and i like see a everybody got it at least once yep yep okay do me a favor unplug your light bulb and come back to your group okay was there anything in between you well actually your moon and your sun no no so does your theory or your hypothesis that the earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work no carolyn says no tom technically it can work because when you have a i forgot what kinda eclipse it s called but it s an eclipse of the moon it goes like all red or something we had it this year and the arth earth arth the earth is blocking it in a way worse okay so is that going to change the phase of the moon nightly becky no she says no do you agree so what changes the phase of the moon ben the way we see it from earth the way we see it from earth agree yes ah interesting now when you did the experiment before when you did it with a flip camera we re gonna re watch some of those videos i m just gonna do the montage so it s not necessarily gonna be your entire class but we re gonna go through and you need to critique each one you need to figure out do they do something wrong do they do something correct do you need to do something with that do you need to re think your flip camera video because we re gonna do it again after we get finished with this make sense are you sure mmm hmm are you positive mmm hmm let s watch the first one okay let me play it for you again see the phases yeah alright now i want you to tell me besides being blinded what did they do correct what was right they were in a orbit not around the sun just a orbit excellent they were not orbiting around the sun a k a the lightbulb what did they do incorrect they didn t call out the phases okay they didn t call out the phases they didn t orbit orbit the camera they did the camera was in the middle so it went around so that s okay think about that they went around there s even something wrong,0.0
about 33 33 so 150 plus 33 180 what d you get 180 180 so is that did we double went a little higher went a little higher so you guys made a good prediction didn t you all right keep doing your trials nice work heads up madison heads up ah can you stop it no you re good all right so what have you guys found out so far we ve been increasing but then we just it increased a little but i think we re gonna increase a little more okay so you re measuring you ve all you ve raised your ramp to 10 yes all right all right now what was your prediction it would go farther based on height because like from all the other experiments that we ve done uh huh it s gone farther so and it has more force if the ramp is higher okay man that ambulance that thing moves all right what did you guys get mary robin when you measured we got 179 179 okay what was weird is that like what s weird is that on the first trial we got 130 and then we went to like the like 50s and things okay and then we went back to like the 80s and 90s yeah all right so now we need to go ahead and do what you ve done your three trials what s the next average average all right let s see we got 182 172 and 179 533 533 and then what are you going to do divide it by three okay divide by three 177 666667 so we can round that up to to 178 178 is that pretty close so you got your trials are pretty close together 182 172 and 179 so you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp was that true yes so your prediction came true let s turn over the back side and let s finish the rest of that lab part so were there any trials that your team did not record we only did it we didn t do that one because it flipped off it like hit this chip card and it just like went whoo it went like all right that s a good one not to include let s write that down we didn t include one because it hit a chip hard yeah yeah that s good it just like flew off to the side and it went all the way like did it really yeah it just that s crazy it was funny because it was also funny because it was going straight but then it just that s weird turned that s weird that it hit that that that caused it to you know make such a turn but then like the whole time it s been going to the the right side oh okay so it s been curving yeah it kind of like tilted and that s a good idea yeah that s a real good idea okay so question two what was the average distance the jeep rolled with the five centimeter height so the five centimeter height on the back side of that we got an average of 30 93 93 all right so write that one down 93 did that surprise you it would go 93 yeah yeah is that farther that s what you thought i never thought we d actually get to the end of it yeah that s a but then we actually did with those little toy cars yeah and this is actually an older looking toy car yeah because whenever i roll one wheel the other wheel rolls just a little oh yeah okay so you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it yeah okay but i never thought it would actually go that far okay so you re now on number three right what was the average distance the jeep rolled 10 centimeter height that was 178 okay so 178 it looks like the next question is did the jeep roll shorter or longer distance longer longer can we figure out how much farther yes what would we have to do the 10 centimeter average minus the 5 centimeter average and then your answer would be how like the distance between well why don t you do that why don t you pull that up the 178 you know it s always better when you can incorporate those into your answers you know it increased by one or it was 85 higher it s always better when you can show your answer with data when you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid right all right so maybe can include that and then move on to that number five there okay all right you guys are doing a great job hey have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side did you read all these first you gotta read this whole section of your lab first okay yeah so i would read this part first and then move on okay all right all right how you guys doing good all right so you guys have done your first trial on this one now did you do this one here i don t let s look at our directions it says change the ramp back to five centimeters high did you do that no sir okay let s do that all right sandpaper and then i think it doesn t it say it says tile floor it says tile floor so we re going to measure on the tile i get to race it all right are we ready now i m going to move over here now what vehicle we got here you should move over there because it always goes over here oh it always moves over here yeah it has a curve yeah how about if i move back over here will that work all right you ready right here yeah that s good oh you re right good thing i moved i ll hold it down hold that down now in your first experiment annie while they re doing this what did it when you increased the height of the ramp did it increase yeah it went faster it went what it went faster because it had more force okay so it had more force so why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab it had more force all right it s more steeper okay and the more steeper it is the more less friction it would cause so it could go faster okay what was the force that was bringing it down the ramp gravity gravity so you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp the pull of gravity is greater yeah because it s going more okay all right it s going down going faster okay and then when it gets if it gets down safely it ll just go farther because it has more speed okay great all right so we re on trial two aren t we yes let s do it go you do have that it does have that curved roll oh it landed on the on the back of it there s like a cargo of some sort in the back of it is it is there a there s cargo in the 113 wait wait hold on let s double check what i would do maybe is bring your jeep over yeah but then it s 106 no but then it s oh you re on the are you going to the front yeah okay 113 yeah you re right no but then you re going at an angle and you don t let it go yeah i mean either way i think you re going to get a as long as you that s the way we re doing it from here well you know as long as you do the same thing every time then you should be consistent right yeah all right one more roll right one more and then we have it yeah one more roll jordan here we go then we have to add them all up dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun the only thing is that is that farther don t you think it s farther are we ready maybe it s because of me do you think you have anything to do with it yeah you do huh go fire 117 how far 117 117 all right 117 so now wait now thiago the math whiz has to do his math all right so how do you find the average again we do we do we add them all up and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it okay let s do it so we rolled it three times you ready let s find our average pencil please oh you guys aren t even using a calculator no we haven t been we only use it for the division oh you only use it for the division hey i like that sometimes sometimes sometimes we still need it what do you guys got 10 that s zero 10 to zero add up the four and three so 340 so you re going to take 340 and then you re going to divide it divided by three and thiago can usually do that you get 113 3333333 all right well check it out on a calculator just to make sure okay how can you do that in your head without a calculator i don t know yeah but how do you do that what did you say the number was thiago it was 113 33333 all right here we go it s 113 come on thiago 113 333333333 he got it all right nice job man all right so 113 is that pretty consistent though yeah yeah because we had a 113 yeah you did and that was your middle score wasn t it yeah and really if you take the thing and then we gotta do this one no never mind i think if you take four here and you put it here yeah if you take three here put it here then you have one more here yep all right so now what we re going to do it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp which we did and predict whether it s going to go we ll have to redo those won t we yeah so let s erase those because you had the ramp at how high 10 centimeters 10 and we needed to we need to have an equal trial we need to have it at the same distance right yeah so the question is sit up for me jordan i know we got a lot of space here what are we going to do you think it s gonna go shorter or a farther distance it s gonna go shorter why because there s more friction sandpaper s rough so it creates more friction okay slow down the thing okay what do you think when it slows it down it may slow it down and then it says the car starts to turn just because just because it s our car goes out to the side so it goes more to the side all right than it usually does what do you guys think farther or shorter i think it ll go shorter because the gravity may be pulling it down but the sandpaper is really rough like thiago said and it would like stop it to make it not move anymore it would like barely get off the paper okay can you guys like say you re riding your bike and you ride your bike on smooth pavement and then you ride it on a rough surface is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough smooth the smooth right so can we use that to help us make our prediction it actually could be faster on the bumps more because if you hit a bump if you re going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump you could actually go in the air okay maybe all right let s go and test this thing out and see if you guys are right annie while we re setting up this lab can you go ahead and write your prediction and it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there now i can t sit here can i this is the bad seat i gotta move well i say you sit it doesn t go very far anymore on the sandpaper all right well let s set it up there that one there right and that one there four centimeters more all right let s look we went 113 with the sandpaper how far do you think it s gonna go let s make a prediction i think it ll go maybe half that or even less than half that okay so what would half of 113 be what s that close to i don t know i think that would be maybe 500 500 and no you want half of it oh five okay half of it 50 i think there you go 50 yeah 50 all right 52 51 point 50 point like okay all right are we ready for the first roll let s do it let s get our first trial here we go we re ready wait who hasn t rolled has emma not rolled okay all right good i like the way your group s working together there all right here we go oh should we use that trial or should we try a different one try again let s try one more maybe we can get that well scoot it right over here and we could even scoot the sandpaper like there yeah all right you ready all right there it is it didn t even move off the sandpaper let s give it can someone hold that down can someone hold that down please here we go this is our test is the prediction right the sandpaper s hard it is it s rough isn t it yeah 49 now aren t you on the front yeah which would be a 49 yeah but you mean or maybe you re about 50 yeah about 50 you guys were pretty close in your prediction weren t you half it was like 50 yeah jordan said 50 1 2 all right you guys got two more trials right i said 51 1 2 you said 51 1 2 all right ready yeah oh man really let s like keep it down or maybe we ll hold it down next time yeah yeah i think that s the problem it s scooting back that was 50 47 yeah 47 okay almost in half all right i ll hold it on this side are we ready here we go,0.0
you re not doing your job follow the arrow good just a little bit why why do we say the wiffle because it because nothing in it it s holes then is it the holes and nothing in it makes it heavy or light light light good next what do we have to do we have all our arrows down good exactly okay thank you someone needs to hold this here i have a job for you come hold the clip hold this here hold this here come around here come here sweetie right here hold this okay now let s count go to there and i ll help okay good good boy oh no uh oh put it in the basket put it in the basket good you have to help her count i need to hear you should i could count 30 no no it s not far when this is 20 21 good is that more than the wiffle ball this one more than this is this one more sebastian yes good good 52 write your 52 down what s the problem what what have you done here okay i see working on her turn she hasn t done anything because we re not helping what which one did you roll you don t need this you re not to this point yet first you re doing the rolling okay you need to move to the side now help her okay good wait wait wait oh okay good now it s turn okay now you help her by holding the end no it s fine i can tell what it is you re doing a good job someone needs to hold this end right here hold the end right here okay now perfect now we have to help her count so she can write her numbers down okay start with the first one the wiffle ball how far is the wiffle ball starting 10 here is this 10 where s the 10 good you think that s how far it is okay so write that down put in wiffle ball i said i m next i said i m next i m looking now at asked about yours i think you have your numbers in the wrong spot which went further wiffle ball which one which one went far the baseball okay because i think on our list you have them written backwards we ll fix them we ll find them with the right picture okay let s see what the problem is the one s got to go on this side please help her count where the baseball is count with her 14 is there a faster way we could ve done that by doing what by doing what exactly by counting by 10s we could ve started here and gone 20 20 and then count from there you re right good so who s next steven now what s going on here sarah was saying something what s happening no remember you did this together count them 20 well let s look it does look like 3 yes good write it on the board but you two can start and then you two can start you hold the good mark it good where does the ball go put it in the basket excellent help the boys now you can hold the ramp it looks like it s about to fall too late wait wait all the things to say now with the rubber ball exactly this one s called the what wiff wiffle ball wiffle ball what happened with the balls hold it let me look at yours you got yours done what happened with yours what happened with the baseball it went which one went the farthest this one how about yours which one of yours went the farthest yeah the baseball remember we talked about that the ball should be in the basket so it doesn t go under the chair counting what happened no but what happened here someone has to hold it you re right can you hold it good that s better 30 this is 50 50 start again each one 51 pablo which one of the balls went furthest the baseball what did we talk about when we said at the beginning which ball did we think was going to go the farthest the baseball why did you think it was going to go furthest because right yes how about yours and sarah s too did the baseball go the farthest that far that was a hard push exactly that was a soft and that was a soft which one was the softest two which one was a really soft push the wiffle ball why why did we say that because the ball just a little bit what happened when you weighed the ball when you put them in the balance the baseball get s heavier the baseball was heavier baseball needed nine magnet weights you re right you remember it was heavy good you re absolutely right okay help him count to his wiffle ball hold the end,0.0
okay would the person who is currently writing please stand up alright nice and loud what did you guys put and why nicholas carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict to create the perfect amount of work okay very good john nice and loud marie curie okay discovered that radiation okay what about you guys alright two claps for these neighbors sit down pass the board one person what would be this is an opinion question what do you think would be the result if scientists didn t communicate their findings to the community at large go do we need to write this down on the board just give a bullet sentence do we have to pick a scientist for this one to prove it nope this is just an opinion just give me like a one word bullet would be fine okay pass the board one person and would that person please stand up troy what did you guys have there would be multiple theories on how things worked society would be stagnant and newton s hypothesis newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff and he didn t think it was important so when he found out a few months before that he didn t publish it until they asked him about it and then he republished to them so they could hang out with everybody else okay excellent what do you guys have there would be no uniform units therefore there would be no real way to judge one s discovery and you couldn t really bounce one idea off another okay what d you guys have we said that we wouldn t have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done because i know that celsius went off of newton s ideas of how the poles were flat and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were okay very good alright two claps for all our neighbors pass the board one person okay i like this one if you could interview any of the scientists that we ve looked at today who would it be and what one question would you be sure to ask okay go okay stop right there pass the board one person please stand up please stand up who s going from this group andy super okay nice and loud let s use active listening john who would you guys pick and what question would you ask marie curie i said it right and what question would you ask dear if she got any oppression from the male scientists okay the oppression from the male scientists i like it what about you guys we would ask thomas edison what inspired you to create the phonograph excellent okay back there who would you pick and what we were also going to ask thomas edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs of the light bulb specifically okay brandon we had albert einstein and our question would be how did he come up with all his theories if he couldn t pass high school math okay what d you guys put we picked oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this if he realized what he actually made you probably can t see it but they have written on the board the manhattan project okay very good and you guys oppenheimer what his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb okay this is a really great segway to what we re going to do next big claps for all these guys please move into your catwalk formation find a partner go in ten without the boards just yourself just your bodies nine eight seven six five oh we have a partner whose hand is up four looks like there we go three two one be sure to oh we need a real quick hands up don t we hand ripple establish who your partner is wow that was emphatic okay be sure you re using active listening because i will quiz you here s your question how are scientists affected by social issues social issues going on in our culture how does that affect what scientists can and can t do or what they think the person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back go when you re done stand back to back okay face me since this one is kind of a shifting gears one i want to let you volunteer did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave yeah interference from the church okay definitely a social issue if they don t have their research believed they could not receive funding or just get shunned basically if it disagrees with what the society basically believes in okay so you could be shunned you could risk your political or your religious beliefs em problems with morality like testing on animals okay did you guys want to add something down there no no you re good they said what we said basically okay this question is for the other partner why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world think for a few seconds why do scientists try to understand the natural world okay give your answer then stand back to back go okay face me i m going to let you guys volunteer on this one too who had a partner with a really good answer yeah it s just human nature to question things okay very good since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it we just question okay what d you guys have because they re extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do okay so we re very curious creatures how to make things in everyday life easier ooooh that segways to my next question split apart brody take the catwalk logan take the catwalk hey you guys were my first ones last time too aw such love i was the first one last time were you yeah oh i just remember those two catwalking together okay shift us down two super shift down two and a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand super okay the person who has ordered the most id badges this year is going to answer the following question shh here s your question five four three two thank you here s your question what motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs what motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs think about it go okay split apart i m just going to randomly popcorn on this one brandon what d you guys say we came up with make life easier okay to make life easier alright what s something you guys said money and power money and power interesting what s something you guys said to decrease death like medical science okay so let people live longer probably also live more quality lives excellent okay take the catwalk take the catwalk shift down two partners once she gets down there shift down two super and a quick hands up hands hands hands hands hands uh oh there we go hands hands hands hands hands hands hands now everybody take three steps that way one two three super okay this time the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question what evidence can you cite from today s scientists that we ve discussed where something microscopic something you can t see was being sensed or manipulated what is an example of the scientists we learned today hold on just one sec what is an example of something the scientists we learned about today hold on hold on hold on i had a request to restate the question what is an example from the scientists we learned about today using sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can t be seen okay now go we certainly cannot see that except on the macroscopic level we can see the results of it brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster so brandon what was your answer i found on thomas edison found radio waves okay very good face me please emily what s something you guys talked about marie curie found radiation from atoms okay very good erin what s something you guys talked about okay very good take the catwalk take the catwalk on the catwalk alright pg pg pg thank you scooch down and hands up hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands super okay the person whose last digit in their address is the lowest is going to answer this question okay here is your question we talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world what is your opinion of scientists manipulating using for our benefit our natural world okay go okay face me nice and loud so everyone can hear brian what did your group discuss we thought it all depended on humanism how they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world that they feel like they re higher than all the other creatures then they can do what they want to the natural world okay so as long as it s being used for good i guess okay with the benefit of humans or the world in general kind of a socialist view the world in general okay john what did you guys say yeah what did we say pretty much the same thing the same thing pretty much okay so are you specifically looking at human needs or more global human okay what about you guys what did you partnership talk about that it was okay to a point there was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world like taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another okay so who should decide what those points are i don t know okay alright that segways us to the next question if you were let s see let s do this the person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question okay if you were the scientific consultant to president barack obama what percentage of our national budget should be spent on science and why justify that amount go it s a percentage so we re not talking a dollar amount what percentage well it doesn t really matter do you think half of our budget do you think a third of our budget you think a quarter of our budget i don t know you could delineate that okay i could tell by looking at you guys that we ve got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this so spread back apart and face me what did you guys say well i said that 15 is a good amount because then it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need okay now you guys had a very specific take on it what did you guys talk about we talked about if medical if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences as well as it should and if it is then the percentage should be increased to help like 50 to 60 if medical is included okay so we have to look at the different kinds of research are we just studying stuff to study stuff are we developing a technology that will help human need are we looking at medical alright very good take the catwalk take the catwalk on the catwalk they do their little turns on the catwalk on the catwalk okay of the science of the person we haven t scooted oh scoot down i m out of order thank you scoot down i got so excited about the questions scoot down scoot down we will okay here we go we re creatures of habit sometimes hands up real fast make sure you ve got the right partner uh huh uh huh uh huh there we go okay the person whose third no the person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest,0.0

just one time for a little pronunciation practice thus thus therefore therefore consequence three syllables con se quence consequence all right good good and the fact is and the fact is these are pretty much words we re gonna use in writing only we don t really speak these words not often very rare these we used in speaking since because and so and these are the words you re gonna be using today you re gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships these are more when you re writing an essay an essay like maybe for the ela or when you re writing an academic essay okay so we have one more you guys are doing so great and i have a lot of stuff here i have a one two three scarf say it with me scarf scarf what about that f on the end scarf

happy tiny small silent little quiet glad right some of these words too you might not even know what they mean but once you work with synonyms a little bit you re going to actually make your vocabulary a little better you re going to learn what more words mean okay so that ll help you read and everything nicolet that s silent and quiet okay you want to come up and match those let me put it on pen okay you have to move over a little bit great okay is she right guys good how did you know that those were synonyms because both of them mean that because both of them mean both of them mean the same thing okay they mean the same thing or what else jabril oh you have another one you want to mark they mean the same thing right you can make up a sentence like we should be quiet in the library and then you could take out the word quiet and put silent in we should be silent in the library that s how you can check it to make sure of it it s like a better word a better word quiet or silent okay fernando you see one okay what do you see oh great can you tell us what you have happy and glad happy and glad okay pick a sentence for those can you think of a sentence i m happy because

little okay very good anyone else who hasn t gone barbara but there s no words is that all of them alright good no tiny and little oh small little and tiny they all go together don t they that s right there s three words that mean the same thing small tiny and little okay so there can be more than one synonym for a word that s a good point do you guys want to practice saying synonym cause it sounds likes it s hard to say let s clap it ready synonym let s try again synonym let s just slow down a minute syn o nym syn o nym alright we ll keep practicing okay now we need to read these sentences and find out which ones have synonyms okay let s start with this one nicolet can you read that the dog is angry the dog is mad are those synonyms yes which two words angry and mad okay you want to come on up you re going to circle those sentences and that dog look at his face too okay if you re writing you could use the word mad that s kind of like i just call it a first grade word sort of you want to bet a sparkle word so you could say he s angry you could also say he furious the dog is furious that s an even better word right a better synonym jabril you want to do the next one okay can you read these the dog it sick the dog is ill so sick and ill are those synonyms good oh you re getting creative with our circles okay barbara you want to read this one the dog is sad the dog is crying okay are those synonyms yes well sort of he would be crying if he s sad i m not sure that they mean the same thing like if you said barbara fell down and now she is crying right that s something that you do right barbara fell down and now she is sad but it doesn t really mean the same thing it s close you want to try this one the dog is happy the dog is glad okay happy and glad do those mean the same

eat mice right fish well we re going to do a fish game and you re going to do this with a partner okay i m going to ask jabril and barbara to sit at the back table hold on a minute wait for your directions and we are going to move those things out of the way and you re going to see if you can match the synonyms together the fish with the fishbowl okay now be sure like when we ve worked with pairs before that one person s not doing all the work and the other person is just you know watching okay make sure if you think two words go together then you say do you think these words or are these synonyms you need to talk to your partner you need to agree okay so you two can go to the back table with those mix them all up mix all your fish up and put them on fishbowl pouch okay and i ll

that s using friendly now you re going to take out this word and use the synonym i am i am nice to everybody in my to the new new student classmate right you use the same words in your sentence you just are going to change your synonym okay good job very good job okay nicolet show us your words first what do you got doze and sleep okay i m using the doze doze means that i am you can put i n g at

who s done writing okay alright ok couple of goals for this piece today here s where we re at here one clearly get the notes and rhythms down because this comstock piece ok and so is the second middleston piece three the primo so we ll do both those today wanna get the notes learned the notes and rhythms learned but i also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece just like if we were getting ready for contest in march do one of those little example pieces for sight singing so we ll treat this in the same manner as that then i wanted to also as we re reading the piece take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it you ll see some things here in a minute alright so if we take a look at the piece and we ve already written solf ge in we take a look at the piece what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different repeats okay even before that like right up by the title canon canon what s that mean the canon okay what s a canon it s a round it s a round right so you have one set of music and then the same set of music follows it later right we do that in warm ups okay alright so a canon so you think soprano and alto are in canon it d probably be women and men probably women and men good good observation so we look at the structure where might that canon begin after a p at the bottom of the page okay so pick up to measure 11 alright okay so what kind of material do the guys have there it says we mix with the women s structure exactly that same material that the girls do so in our rehearsal noting that this is a canon at least to that point how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away girls and guys sing their parts together girls and guys sing their parts together good easy so if we do that then what might something else be helpful for us to do we re singing parts together maybe pair up typically we get together and we chant so let s do that first let s do the chanting just like we do for sight singing so you can practice that okay so what are our pairs gonna be soprano and tenor so you have to move and bass and alto so starting at solf ge girls you start at the beginning guys you simply start at measure pick up at measure 11 okay go on and move yes circle up right here alright who s gonna be our leader who wants to start us off alena alena okay you can start us off who s going to start the you okay there you go okay good go for it chant it quickly let s start at the beginning we are on the pick up to 4 so 1 2 3 and 4 so so mi fa so do re mi okay so now we got to the end of that go to measure 11 for the girls and measure 21 for the guys go right there and start it again so now girls you go measure 11 which is right where you finished and guys go to 21 same thing here that s a little bit different alright 1 and 2 let s all chant together in rhythm stay in your groups stay in your groups please but we re gonna start with the sopranos and altos and then we ll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page so start at the beginning everybody 1 2 and ready and go stop okay now guys you re gonna pick up there and girls you re gonna come in 2 beats later here we go ready and go okay go right on the coda please so we would ve done the repeat now we go back here go right on the coda please right after the double bar ready and go 3 4 fermata cut off please sopranos ready and go bass okay pretty good we ll come back to that that takes a little bit of fordating when you get together okay go back to sections let s do right in the not your traditional sections let s keep the basses over here altos over here tenors and sopranos over here so do two rows back in your sections okay so we re gonna do just like we chanted we re gonna partner up and we re gonna sing it at the same time okay at the same time so guys you re starting in measure 11 girls you re starting in measure pick up to 1 ready and do do do do do sing that first note please sopranos and altos and okay tenors and basses okay let s sing all at the same time right where your canon first name of the canon is here we go 1 2 and ready and sing okay sopranos sorry altos and basses here we go doo doo that s a mi here we go start that again 1 and beginning and go okay go back to the do do mi so la fa do la fa sing that ready on the do 1 2 do that again same spot 1 2 okay good excellent reading good for you now putting it together canon lots of people think oh canons are easy no problem it s the same thing except canons tend to be tricky we ll see how it goes here we go soprano and alto first do mi so mi do sing your first notes girls ready and here we go 1 2 and ready and go okay good i was gonna stop you before then but you did so well so we kept singing good for you okay so what happens at 21 for the girls well not sorry measure 11 for the girls does what something different so what would we call it b or the counter melody of this okay so it s kind of the same shape but it starts on what pitch class instead of do no sorry what did we first start at the beginning so and mi and this starts on do so different pitch class same shape but it s singing the fifth lower okay for soprano okay good let me hear the guys please you did really well until we got to the b section let me hear actually let s hear everybody do the b section so guys you re gonna start at 21 girls you re gonna start at 11 basses it s just no it s not it s not different at all do here is do find your first pitch,0.0
yeah why don t we list that up here okay here is what you re going to do go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick put those pencils away in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and just to make sure you haven t now you have identified you have taken this work of art you ve seen what it is and you ve taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used now we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements what kind of thought feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements with this subject so who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found what s one shapes shapes what s another one color color shape lines value value texture you guys with those elements they re telling you something so here s what we re going to we re going to put on our thinking pairing and sharing hats so whatever i do that so you guys can pair and share together will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference thank you all right first question ready the first question is how does this man feel now think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel no talking think to yourself think shh you ve got to tell me why too don t just think about feeling tell me why two people look like they re pairing already don t pair yet now tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking is feeling is feeling all right now we re ready to share with the whole group so i m going to start with right here with jermaine s group and we re going to go around and each person is going to get a turn or each pair is going to get a turn so first what was your group thinking how did he feel sad why because the color blue is a sad color and he looked down so he had two reasons he had the body position because he s kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten good job he said that sad and the color blue go together what do you guys think how does he feel i think he feels happy he s smiling and he s playing the guitar okay because he s creating music maybe that s what makes him happy i heard miss webster had a disagreement when they were pairing miss webster what is your take what do you think he s feeling tell me what you think he is sit up tell me what you think he is i think he s sad because okay because why he looks what say it again honey don t be embarrassed it s okay to have a different opinion i think he is lonely because he doesn t have any friends there s nobody else in that picture he is by himself in the picture maybe he s lonely we don t know okay so we had a difference of opinion that s okay next pair i think he s sad because he s looking down if he was happy he d be whoa wait a minute she just said this man doesn t have anything to eat why do you think he doesn t have any because his shirt is torn he don t have no pants and he don t have no socks so you re telling me he looks what is he rich or is he poor no he s poor okay that is very good insight on not only the details but also just what those details are telling us okay do you have something else to add what would you say i said i think he was happy to sit alone i think he s happy because he just okay so you think the guitar looks even though his clothing looks torn his guitar looks nice right maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes maybe not last pair tell me what you think he s feeling i think he s one at a time i think he s it looks like he s playing a sad song he s playing a sad song and he s playing why do you think it looks like he s playing a sad song because he s bowing his head down and his face don t look very happy okay you guys next question i can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat did you have something different than that okay go ahead i think he s sad because he looks like he s homeless oh maybe he s homeless now why do you think he s homeless because his shirt s torn on the side are there any other clues besides his clothing we already had miss marshall tell us about his clothing what other clues do we have that makes us think he s homeless without talking and making noise jermaine do you have a clue why he might be homeless why because he s outside by his self he looks like me might be outside this might be a step that he s sitting on next question next question what do you think the artist is trying to tell us what is the important message put your hands down think what is the message why is the artist painting this picture of this man i have one person she s got herself in the thinking posture she s thinking think please think think think i ve got a good thinker at this table i hope you re thinking honey okay now pair up ready pair and share with your table mate get paired up thirty more seconds to share i hear some good talking so i m giving you 30 more seconds why don t you share this time because you shared last time okay so you re going to share this time let s see you sitting up nice and tall we re going to share with the entire group we all learn from each other you guys we re going to start with the opposite way i m going to go this way can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us by painting this picture i m sorry just a second could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve you guys when you re listening to what he s saying he s trying to tell you what he thinks what his table mate thinks so you need to turn your body make eye contact and really listen to what he s saying okay okay go again i think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he s homeless he doesn t have any money he doesn t have any value okay when you mean value do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean like he seems very sad okay so you re talking about the color right okay next group i think that the artist is trying to persuade him wait a minute say that word again he s trying to what persuade persuade us what persuade us to think what persuade us he feels real mad or trying to do music or something okay is that what your team came up with you came up with something different than your team you had a disagreement right i think that i was not do you think the artist wants you to be like him no what do you think the artist wants you to learn from him he won t have nothing to work you can have a better life right okay this group could you put your feet down it s your turn you re going to share with us what your team came up with you can share come on you can talk to us remember that there s no wrong answer it s just what you think,0.0

three two one stop okay were there pairs of you who chose different things um hmm and who wants to share i said if i had to pick i would pick the green cylinder because the white would overflow easy the pink you would have to reach down far to get it okay devon i would pick the pink one because it s like thin enough to be like a cup and you can do this with it and it would be a lot easier than just like doing this especially because if it gets on the bottom of the green one it would be hard to get it and the white one it might spill if you walk around with it or you could trip okay good layla but well i agreed with devon on the pink one but i would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn but it also is harder to hold unless you were to like since it has more area the white one has more area than the pink or the green one more area you re talking this way yeah okay so you re saying you take the popcorn and you could like you could make it even on the bottom of it so it wouldn t necessarily be overflowing unless you were when you walk for the popcorn thing okay all right brittany me and lani had the same answer we would think that it sort of relates to what devon said if we picked the green one because and related to the pink one s gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn and the green one is wide enough and it can hold it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one but it s still gonna be hard to get down the pink one and the white one s just gonna spill okay all right tiffany we thought that the green and pink one it doesn t matter because they re probably gonna hold the same capacity since they re the same shape it s just one s taller and one s shorter but the short one s wider and the tall one s skinnier it s tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same so you said either one of these two it didn t matter okay kylie i would want the green cup because it s easier like to get your hand down it the pink one looks like really skinny so if you have big hands it would be hard to get your hand down it okay all right amani i think the green one becuase when you look at it the old popcorn container and the green one they re kinda the same although the green one is a little bit bigger so then you could get more okay i said the green one also because the pink one is skinny and it if went to the same size as that with the same amount of popcorn it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one do you know what i m saying say that again okay i picked the green one because say you fill them with popcorn and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one and you put it in the green one it s gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one and the white one it s just gonna fall over cause it s too small it s too flat okay hold on josh now tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount did you say that mm hmm and why did you say that because they re the same size paper except one they re just folded different okay she said that because they re the same size paper they re folded differently but she thinks that they re gonna hold the same amount and you are disagreeing mm hmm okay she s disagreeing saying that the green one s going to hold more is that correct what you said i said yeah the green one would hold more okay josh what do you think i said i would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out and because it might have more volume than those two yeah okay so let s change our thinking here some of you did think about which one is going to hold more it didn t matter whether your hand could get easier into this one or devon liked this one cause he could tilt it up he didn t even have to have his hand in it at all which is an interesting way to look at it a lot of you said you didn t like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot yes ma am but unless you did what i suggested and you like evened it out on the bottom yes because you said you liked this one cause you thought it held more than the other two but you d have to like flat not necessarily like squish the popcorn so it s flat you d have to like shake things sideways so that it would even it out like food in a pan you would shake it to even it out on the bottom okay all right well it s kinda like with the little kid packs there are things shaped like that and it has like gummies and popcorn in it and i don t like it cause like everyone would get the other ones it would have like more popcorn in it okay tiffany what i would suggest the white one is like even it s the same shape as the other two pieces of paper but it s folded so it s taking less up space but it s folded because it overlaps here it does overlap here with the white you re right there but i disagree with molly because the popcorn amount that s inside of the inside the square ones at newtown is the same amount as one of the plastic ones the exact same amount of popcorn cause they actually use those as measuring cups i ve watched them do it and i ve watched them actually use those cups those hard ones to fill the other cup to fill the other ones so you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this all of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones as measuring cups all right devon i agree with layla like they re all the same i think it just depends on like who you are kind of like which one you want okay but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one yeah so if you could choose that would be a good thing right hold on a second let s move on a second and i m gonna have mk come up here and help me we re gonna see if they hold the same okay i want you however on your paper to write down you know which one you think holds the most do they hold the same or if you think they hold a different amount put em in order like which one is least middle greatest why don t you do that real quick why don t you put em in order which one do you think okay this is what she thinks she thinks least middle greatest here s what we re going to do i do not have popcorn but i do have cereal and hopefully hopefully mk can pour this hopefully okay so you re i m gonna hold it or would you rather hold it and me pour wait yeah you might wanna pour it okay and just make sure that the bottom stays okay we are smellin the sugar up here yeah okay can you all see that it s at the top yeah all right now what we are going to do so this is this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls we re gonna put this over top and you re gonna lift it up and see what happens and some of you have predicted that it s going to be the same right how many have predicted that they re all the same all the same okay how many are predicting that the green is bigger predicting that the green is bigger okay what about the white is biggest anybody predict the white is biggest okay why don t you lift this up i ll hold this this time you gotta make sure that pink s bigger ooh can you see can you see so there s more room right there s more room in the green one why because the more space it has the bigger around it is the more cereal that could fit in it so what is that called around here circumference well this is circumference but at the bottom volume it is volume cause we re measuring volume but what is at the bottom of this base a base is that what you re saying that the base it depends on how big the base is well let s look to see whether it ll fit in here okay there it is exact same room as the pink well do you think there s the exact same room as the pink no i think the white has more you think the white could fit more yeah okay thank you mk have a seat but what do we know about this one now it s the smallest it s the smallest do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here and figure out what the formula or the volume is like the length of it the length of the pink one does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures eight by is it eight by 12 eight by 12 eight by six eight by 10 eight by 10 eight by 10 a foot a foot eight by 11 okay it is actually eight and a half by 11 okay eight and a half by 11 so our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11 okay so for our pink one what is when we do this what is this the circumference its the circumference what do we know about the circumference then for the pink one that it s 8 5 it is 8 5 so circumference equals what 8 5 the circumference equals 8 5 are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference yes no you say yes yeah i know what you could do you could divide it by 3 14 cause that s how you get cause you know how it s the opposite of times so that you would do it and you would divide that by 8 4 no 3 14 and then you ll have the diameter and then you can just take half of that and that d be the radius okay all right tell me brittany what is the formula for circumference pi times d circumference equals pi times d i m gonna ask someone to restate what kiki said does anyone agree with kiki yes i do and what did she say she said that you can divide the circumference by 3 14 okay so we know the circumference is 8 5 correct and we know that pi is what molly 3 14 3 14 and we re trying to find the the what devon diameter the diameter okay so both kiki and maya say you divide by 3 14 is that what we do treyshawn yes so if i divide this side by 3 14 and i divide this side by 3 14 what happens to this right here india it would get smaller it gets smaller yes if you divide it okay what is 3 14 divided by 3 14 one sure,0.0
and one more there s this one spider and he s around all day and then he comes and comes out oh so it s waiting for him you know i ts like a trap it covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower it sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it it attacks it and eats it wonderful so they re not really attracted to flowers they re attracted to the insects in order to ambush them is that what you re telling me yes okay all right so and we talked about what is it that attracts these well we see a lot of bugs we see humming birds and jack mentioned this word pollen do you know what pollen is do you know what pollen is ah do you know what pollen is are these things attracted to the pollen yes well not really though no not really sometimes sometimes i guess say that again please it s an ingredient to make honey pollen is an ingredient to make honey oh nectar yeah so bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank nectar go ahead jimmy how would you fill this in the bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank go ahead and write your answer in oh okay i see some people writing pollen you have color they re definitely attracted to their color we have nectar and we have we actually have all of them here so which one is it is it one of these or all of these all of these all of them all of them tell me more tell me i think it s pollen and nectar because the nectar s in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff or honey out of it so it s kind of like taking it to its so we say that flowers attract insects so we can connect these two ideas here and we ve talked about their color the insects were attracted because of their color and they re also attracted because of their nectar nectar okay let s put nectar right here and they re also attracted because of their good smell no yeah yeah no the nectar smells good that s why butterflies go to them maybe look that up on google why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good so bees will go to them why do people go to trouble to smell good why not because it would be gross say that again attention you want attention you want to be attractive to other people too heck no maybe you re too young for that yeah when you get older don t you want to attract other people sure don t you want other people to find you pleasant yes you know it s not a big thing but are these fragrances signals to these insects they re attractive right and we ll talk about i agree they are useful but that s not going to fit into my process just yet but all of these things do attract the insects right but what is it that keeps the insects coming back it s sort of like the color the smell you know the maybe the shape of the flower all of these things are like advertisements to the insects why for the nectar for the nectar it s the nectar that s going to keep them coming back all right you see this bee here what s all this yellow stuff on the bee pollen pollen does the pollen attract the bee no does the bee want the pollen no yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive the pollen is definitely important to the flower right mm hm the bees just spread it around the bees spread it around how many people are aware that bees spread pollen i see just about all your hands go up so the insects are spreading let s put that up here they re going to spread the stuff called pollen right of course the insects are really getting what nectar yeah so let s put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here right and nectar is another word for what food you all understand that nectar is their food for the bees for the bees just the bees no and hummingbirds and insects us and hummingbirds us us we have honey nectar is technically honey so nectar is actually a food for us because we steal it from the bees right yeah and we hide it from the bears yes isn t there this one point where it has saliva or something in the bottom of it and it s in the shape of a picture and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything and they get into the water they can t move and everything they re paralyzed okay it s a trap yeah like the venus fly trap just like the venus fly trap yeah i don t know what it s called do venus fly traps have flowers no they have clear white the mouth smells really sweet that s because it catches flies okay we re going to talk about that in a minute a lot of people when i was reading your paragraphs a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don t have flowers all right but let s look at this thing about pollen for a minute why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar what s going on here they want them to spread the pollen but why to make more food to make what to make more food you think it s to make more food what do you think olivia to make like honey the flowers want the bees to make honey no they like need it to make more food pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make i understand that but why does the flower go to all this trouble do flowers just like bees no they say hey you re a nice guy we ll make you some to keep them alive i think to keep the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive no i don t know that s okay that s okay what do you think joe to fertilize other flowers fertilize what s fertilize you mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer different you re calling it a different kind of fertilizer interesting how many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization how many people have heard that before hands up here okay so if you want to ask what pollen is you might want to ask what flowers do all right and to answer that i first of all let s make sure this dandelion is this a flower or is this a weed flower a weed okay thumbs up or thumbs down who says it s a weed okay i see most of you thumbs up a couple of you have sideways or down next how about this one how many people think it s a flower okay how many people say it s a weed and a flower now i see some people who don t know well let me ask you this if you re to look at this here s a pretty good picture of it what makes you think it s a flower are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it s a flower yes i don t think it s a flower that s not my question are there characteristics about this that make you think it s a flower yes what would those be the petals the petals excellent anything else it s color it s colorful anything else it has some nectar maybe you think it has nectar maybe a little bit have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions yes who have seen who have seen yeah it s very common well you can actually see bees on top of on top of flowers here s a close up of the dandelion what do you notice there that looks a lot more ugly it looks ugly yeah really no it looks cool it looks like water spouts goin like it does look like water what do you see on the side here pollen does that look like pollen what does pollen look like just tiny balls of stuff of stuff yeah there those tiny little like they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it s with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower so it stays with them for a while a ball and then it sticks to the bee like if you want to see the bee it s got all the yellow stuff on his leg yeah we had the picture earlier yeah yeah i saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body cool actually that s the pollen so the pollen so it is picking up pollen so it sounds to me that i guess what i want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers they are yeah they re definitely flowers let me show you a picture of a dandelion a little video it s about one minute long and let s go ahead and turn the lights off and as you re watching it just tell me what you observe happening in the video just go ahead and shout it out the flower is opening it s blossoming okay this is time lapse so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally but you saw the flower open it s dormant dying now and now it s closing up and it s dying it s going dormant it s dead how many people think it s dead no it s still growing it s dormant it s growing into that white stuff say that again it s turning into that thing in the ball that s like marissa s making a prediction it s gonna grow taller no it s going to break up do you see the insects all over it every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it oh yeah yeah there s one down at the root at the very base of it yeah something s happening something s happening it got taller on the screen oh the bottom petals are starting to die what s that it s starting to look like an onion what s that thing on the top it s going to blow away it s going to grow into a dandelion that was the flower wasn t it that s the thing you blow on what s that they re seeds they re seeds yeah you blow on them and it s really fun it s reproducing i m hearing steven say they re seeds and brandon oh that thing disappeared that whole top blew away that s the stuff that you like to blow how many people think these are seeds i know they are ah andrew s thinking so the flower turned into what a seed a reproducer a big seed no they re all little seeds no they re all individual seeds are they blowing yes make a wish can i have the lights on please so you have like a month period yeah that took a while and i think you ve seen dandelions you may not have you ve probably seen the dandelions in two stages sometimes they re like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white puffy seed pods right you puff on them and they blow in the wind yeah what does the wind do it blows them away and it starts reproducing so each seed is like a little parachute yeah and it s dispersed to new lands yes all right so if i were to say flowers if i were to make a connection between flowers and seeds what would you say about that what will you say what is the connection between flowers and seeds mckenzie they both reproduce they re both related to reproduction okay uh huh one makes another okay so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds and there s that word that mckenzie was using reproduce because seeds grow into flowers flowers which then grow into seeds which then grow into more plants what does that sound like life cycles wonderful wonderful these are life cycles what i m going to ask you to do right now is we re going to look at a seed very very closely i have some you know what these are lima beans oh i love lima beans you do really yeah oh i don t like lima beans i ve never tried them i like them in my favorite dish chicken pot pie my dad loves lima beans anyway i have some they have been soaking overnight in some water and they re going to look a little bit different because they ve been soaking under water what i want you to do is when you get one i want you to open it up like a book dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully and i want you to look inside that s what the magnifying glasses are for i want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed everyone clear go ahead one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds how many oh you know what get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn t work we have a spare three not unbroken nice plump seeds take them to your seat i just want you to look at them they re bigger they are bigger aren t they what else are they they re sort of hard they look like mandarin oranges why s that what makes you think they re like oranges they re not hard anymore they re no what they re not hard anymore they re not hard we grew them last year what s that we grew them last year oh you grew these last year what do these turn into farmer s they turn into plants what are we supposed to be looking for well you tell me don t break them open here s how i want you can i borrow this okay i want you to go to the round part here and you notice it has like a seed coat yeah okay you know kind of peel that back oh cool and then open it up like a book okay i m looking at the skin like this yeah open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find there s a little surprise there what is this it s a bug it s located yeah oh gross mine s already broken so well you have a good one right here this is perfect oh i see it look at that that s a really good one i don t see it yeah go ahead break it just like you did i can t open it and oh yours is right here yours kind of fell apart do you have another seed be there in a second okay oh there it is right there do you see that i don t have one look at it very carefully with the magnifiers what do you have let me see what you got yeah right there there s actually part of it right here broke in half and that s attached and there s also a little bit here perfect look at this patrick that s what you want to look at i can t open mine see it see it there what do you see i don t see it oh there is a little bit of green there isn t there yeah who else is having trouble me i already opened mine yes you did are they supposed to smell bad yeah they do kind of smell don t they yeah they smell did you see that whole thing right on the tip look at that under the magnifying glass okay okay look at my photograph up here here we go this is kind of what you re looking at you have these two like little half circles little kidney shaped starchy figures but what is this thing right here it s a seed it s starting to sprout what is it it s a start of a lima bean i thought this whole thing right here it s the start of a lima bean plant this is like a plant sprouting out is that what you re trying to say steven what s that is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant like that like the big parts might be like maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger well did you notice there are two parts to it yeah yeah it like goes down there is what s this right here it s the sprout okay i heard you say it looks like a stem anybody think it looks like anything else uh huh go ahead mckenzie why are these pointing here why are these pointed it s kind of new that makes sense looking to break through break through the the soil and what breaks through the soil what part of the plant breaks through the soil the seed the root does it look like a root yeah how many people think it looks a little bit like a root and this looks a little bit like a stem what does this look like to you a flower let me see it looks like this and there s another one that kind of looks like that what does that look like to you leaves leaves what do leaves okay do you ever see anybody draw pictures whats that it looks like a carrot it looks like a carrot doesn t it okay look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier i want you to look for a detail you see a little characteristic oh i see it i see it what do you see i see like the veins of a leaf wonderful i don t oh yeah i do wonderful you have little veins there on the leaf yeah you can see,0.0
three oh it makes like a cubic graph it s like a cube oh whoa that s pretty cool what about what if only two of them are the same it s like a quadratic all right so as we go through the investigation now we re gonna look at try to come up with conjecture for that numerically why do you think that happens if two factors are the same because it makes like because if you have two factors are the same that s the same as like squaring one of the factors what happens if you square numbers they become positive i believe so it s always positive for that section very nice okay keep on keep on going with that all right just say a b c d e etcetera e is the zeros of the law i m on the first one why are they the same they re squared go to google docs see if you can do files the file is gray okay so what s gonna happen is you re gonna have a factor formula unlike the other one we had it instead and what you want to look at is look at the factors and look at the zeros what s the relationship between the factors and zeros you may already know what the relationship is can you predict what it s gonna be that the factors tell you the zeros like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are and why would that makes sense to you oh because when it s x and you have a number after that that s where it is on the x axis so that could be where the zeros in a set right maybe teresa does that make sense to you you look kinda confused like so x minus one is no that is wrong then well here look at your flag look right here it s sittin right here so x minus one so that s one so there s one one and then x minus two is the there too oh so it s the opposite of the form so if you haven t factored form then you know that it s even zero yeah yeah it would be equal to zero right yeah you re right remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing yeah all right so that does make sense does the end behavior make sense it s in factored form but what s the degree of that it s three it s the third degree and what does a third degree what did we learn last time it can intersect three times it can intersect three times does it yeah and what s the end date down and up down and up and it is right yup so that makes sense that does make sense why don t you try it with quadratic factor here and why don t you put in an extra factor just edit that just add that x whatever something we ve not used yet what s the f in this one the eraser but you added this one right yeah so what do we except s gonna happen how many zeros are we gonna get this time four what s the degree so what should the end behavior be because you weren t here last time so let s see if you pick it up so if it s fourth degree what s gonna happen on the right what s gonna happen on the left both good yay high five get rid of the space after the parenthesis which one between the parenthesis and the f yeah add a space there s not an f see the sliders here this f was there to start out with so just delete it then yeah just delete that so x minus e is just that so we expect did it come out the way you excepted it to come out yeah there s four zeros and if you slide those zeros go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense oh that s good oh because it changes whatever the final one would be at so if we had like x plus something where is the actual zero oh it is x plus something it s the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place so if we say x x plus three where s the zero negative three does that make sense because x plus three equals zero yeah all right what s the next question on there does the y intercept change all right so let s look at your zeros and look at your y intercept as you change the sliders does the y intercept change we can t see our y intercept you gotta scroll out mr dillard would you get me me the mouse over there the silver one yeah it s a lot easier to do this with a mouse i got it other way because the y intercept is now it might be really yeah it s right there why don t we try making some of these factors smaller so that we can see it a little better i got it oh fine i see how it is okay can you see it it s like at negative 15 okay is there a relationship between that y intercept and the factors or the zeros why don t you guys talk it over what are the zeros so the zeros are what are the zeros and the zeros are all the numbers that are they re the opposite of this so it would be negative two four and a half and one wait what s the y intercept it s 15 two yeah it s down here it s actually 18 and it s negative 18 four and a half times two is nine times two is 18 times one it s 18 you multiply all the end numbers together and you get the y intercept well that s nice that is cool but why does that make sense why would that work why does that work oh because to get the y intercept the y intercept doesn t have an x value so you just in order to factor this equation you would just multiply all the end ones to get it oh yeah because it s the numbers after x like almost zeros zeros well are the numbers after x the actual zeros if it said x plus three the roots x plus three what would the zero be for that negative so they re the inverse of the zeros the opposite the opposite yeah you have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning all right so if we know what the zeros are and we multiply those and we got the y intercept right yeah what about a what happens when you slide a around does that change slide a around i already know what should happen you can just use the mouse i can t click it move oh that s why it changes the middle one did it change the zero start with that does it change the zeros at all no no no it doesn t change the zeros well okay go back to it s not changing the zero well actually well it s just changing it s steepness yeah it s changing it s steepness and the width but it s not changing the zeros well yeah it does because when it s flat then every number s changed but when its flat but that s only if a is zero since they re multiplying everything by a then if a is zero everything is zero so yeah you have a zero degree polynomial at that point yeah yeah okay so other than when a is zero all it s changing is the steepness of the graph and not changing the zeros so does that change the y intercept um yes it is changing the y intercept but i think it still works out as um you can still multiply all of them together does that make sense check and see if it still works oh whatever a is is a is the opposite of the y intercept because if a is four then the y intercept here is or that might just be well that s a good conjecture check some of the other things and see if it still works um try changing yeah yeah no that s not right that would be cool it was just the way i had it and that s one of the nice thing with the sliders because you might see a connection but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case the y intercept is six yeah it s still ah when you change a it s still going to effect the y intercept and as changing as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by a does that make sense yeah so all those numbers multiplied together is still six keep going with this because the next thing we re gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same when we use the factor more than once okay keep going are we on six now yes what happens when two or more factors are the same so make e and e i m gonna make them all three i work hard for you guys you criticize me um the e the e oh it makes the when they re the same try changing one of them try changing one of the sliders we figured that one it just turns out to be the opposite so go ahead and change one slider just pick one other than a pick b or something like that the opposite of that variable becomes the y intercept that doesn t explain the zeros now something we want to find out is there a relationship between the zeros and the y intercept oh there is when you change the y then the zeros equal the opposite of the y intercept okay what happens if you change two no it doesn t oh yeah yeah it does oh yeah zero does the one that isn t the same numerical i think the right most zero becomes it when you move them the y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate because if you move like c steadily to the left once c is two negative two jacob said half the time when you multiply them all together you get it yeah that s what we re discussing the absolute value of the y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero if two of the factors are the same that s in if all of the variables are the same except one of them it becomes the zero it becomes the zero and the opposite of the y intercept so now as you slide you ll actually be able to see the y intercept if you set all the variables the same and change one of them it becomes the zero and the opposite of the y intercept okay so on dave s right here yeah the multiplication in case you like if you multiply all the zeros together you get the opposite of the y intercept does it have to do with the factor formula yeah yeah so the absolute value of the if you multiply the zero so does it make sense algebraically yes why does it make sense algebraically when you find the factor with that new grouping you have to it becomes the opposite but y intercepts algebraically because the y intercept is when all the x s are zeros so you re just left with the one that doesn t have an x on it and that is the multiplication of all the factors all the numbers,0.0
can you make some shadows i see light how will you make a shadow how are you making a shadow how are you making a shadow alicia my hands what is your hand doing making a shadow how is it making a shadow i don t know how is it making a shadow brandon because your hand is stopping the light your hand is stopping the light and it s small cause your hand is far away from your body and more light comes around your hand what happens if you move it close to the light it has it big because it stops more light because it stops more light it s stopping more light you re right let s go see what these guys are doing what are you guys doing blocking the light from the light in there you re blocking the light how are you blocking it we re going forwards and backwards to make it little so i see your shadow is changing how is it changing because you re closer to the light and then you re when you get close it gets bigger it gets bigger and when you re far it gets littler okay why does that happen what s happening when you re down here it gets big it gets bigger why does it get bigger what happens to the light the light can t go through your hand and and and it s blocking it it s blocking more light what happens over there then it s blocking a little bit of light okay so more light gets around it right alright very good can you guys make different shadows it s a turkey that looks like the red nosed reindeer the red nosed reindeer how are you changing your shadow you have to make shapes of the animals i don t know what to make that s okay make anything you want you guys go ahead make em big and small and i ll be back in a little bit duwant is helping you duwant what s happening over here doing some measuring what are you measuring how come you guys are measuring down here and not in the window because are you able to see the box how come you re not measuring the fifth one where s the sun the sun is on the other side other side of the building way over there so we can t measure the shadow sticks today can we that s why you re making shadow sticks on the ground okay show me a shadow stick okay bristava you can handle the light what can you do can you hold the stick up for us julie to make a shadow okay can you do the measuring okay go ahead and measure it put your hand down here so we can see the top can we measure that stick no we re gonna measure the shadow you wanna measure the stick first and then compare it to the shadow okay you gotta hold that real still don t you is your light high or low low it s lower what happens if you put it lower what happens to the shadow it turns big it grows it grows it gets longer what if we put it high it s gonna be fat gonna be short is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick i need to you to measure it okay let s record it you measure the shadow measure the shadow whoops scuse me let s measure the shadow measure the shadow is that long enough or do you need another hold it still bristava is that long enough is the shadow longer or the stick longer let s compare there s the shadow measurer and there s the stick what do you notice it s the same size it s the same size it sure is what if you did it down here though would it be the same size if you put the ball down here no the shadow would be much longer wouldn t it good work guys keep measuring try a different stick use that pointer stick or another stick here s a stick here s some more sticks for you to try i m done with these things already it s okay okay what are we doing can you guys guess what that is scissors how did you know it was scissors because the shadow okay the shape of the shadow told you didn t it she put on some blocks okay no oh she says no it s not blocks is she tricking you yeah sometimes the shape is hard to tell can you guess adam no take a look at this one adam take a look at this one oh nope not from up here what do you think that is know what this is bryce what is that one can you tell from the shape what this one is gluestick a gluestick you re right good guessing how could you tell shadow of the lid you saw the shadow of the lid good job bryce s turn okay now are you guys gonna play the takeaway game okay remember she s gonna put a whole bunch of objects on there sit down and you grab a good long look and then close your eyes and she ll take one away and you ll have to guess what shadow is missing okay alright what are we doing over here guys what are we doing you re making shadows shadows you re checking out different materials yeah okay so what is that one shelby what did you find out about that one goes through what goes though what goes through the light the light goes through so does it make a shadow yes which part of it makes a shadow boys and girls check your voices please thank you this part okay that thick part makes a shadow doesn t it what about the thin parts doesn t make a shadow does it the light goes right through what else did you try what are you trying takori tell me about it show me why don t you try this trayshawn but wait takori was trying something just a minute what have you got takori a tissue it s what a tissue a tissue is the light going through it or did it stop the light stopped the light it stopped the light so it made a shadow didn t it did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow a dark one okay trayshawn your turn what are you trying the box is it stopping the light get back here so you can see put it down here can you see it what do you see about it it s making a shadow which part is making a shadow the whole thing is that a dark shadow or a light shadow a dark shadow is this part dark or light light okay why is this part light becuase it is a light shadow can t hear you babe because it s a light shadow why is it a light shadow why isn t it a dark shadow what s happening to the light some of the light going through it mm hmm what do you think cooper what s making that shadow um the light okay the light is making the shadow what are we using what is this a box okay is it clear or colored clear okay so what happens to the light it goes through okay it goes through it doesn t it so it only makes a little bit of a shadow good job did you guys write the things over here did you find anything new to write down let s try that shelby you and cooper come over here and try that okay cooper you may go to the bathroom what do you see shelby sorry you see a light shadow why is it light cause it goes right through is any part of that dark this part that part why do you think that part s dark cause it has a wrapper the wrapper and what s the wrapper doing to the light it s stopping the light and it s making a shadow exactly very good shelby thank you go right here okay what s our time we have two minutes left we might wanna go back and see hey what d we find out raja what are we doing here measuring what s your shadow doing can you change your shadow how do you change your shadow by moving by moving by moving the object how else could you change your shadow what about the light what would you do with the light move it move it i ll hold your stick and you move the light how is your shadow changing getting bigger what else could you do move your light some more move it up or down ooh what happened to the shadow it got shorter oh now what s happening got longer didn t it this is making a shadow that s easy to see look at that shadow when the light is high the shadow is shorter short and when the light is low the shadow is alright now measure that measure that how many cubes lie on that shadow one two three four five six seven is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick longer or shorter than the stick the same oh it s the same i think our,0.0
okay so ready to go here okay i d like to take you back to the fifth century to a time when attila the hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of gaul or western europe much to the chagrin of the roman empire but where i hear you ask is attila the hun himself well i fear he has perished he died in a drunken brawl would you believe on his wedding night and who am i i hear you ask to be telling such a tale why i am mrs attila the hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of gaul javelins and bows and arrows those were very well and good for tacticians such as attila the hun but what do i know about tactics not much so i need something very little you are right josh the hun is right so what i need is to get some sort of a war machine now let s first think about what characteristics do i need in a weapon that would help us against to help us conquer the lands of gaul what characteristics do we need in the weapon what do we need it to do hurt people in other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or force something else so a force we need to have some sort of force range what else i m sorry jackie range range the range would be a good thing especially if we can get beyond bow range right that would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far right steph efficiency efficiency can you tell me more about what you re thinking well being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering all right we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done we need to be able to not perhaps use every single hun for it so efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages yes katie possibly something that you could use again oh yes if we only use it once that s kind of a problem isn t it we want to be able to use it repeatedly good idea other things we want to think about joe something that s mobile all right so maybe wheels might help or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried okay those are good thoughts jackie accessibility like making sure it s easy to use and not like difficult to set up so if it takes a bunch of people and they re struggling to reset it maybe not a good idea something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle all right so we ve had a good deal of ideas so far that s really good so i need some sort of a war machine something that would have all of those properties in it hmmm why what is this message for you mrs the hun a message okay let s see why it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet ooh we have a picture of our new war weapon but here s the challenge i need to build the best trebuchet the best war machine that i can and i m not certain what properties what characteristics what parts of this machine i should emphasize how big they should be how strong they should be so i m going to need you to help me out i m going to make little groups of huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet each group can then test a different quality what sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet to see what would be the best one caroline caroline the weight on the opposite end all right the weight the counter weight and the load both of those things and perhaps the ratio of them could be rather important josh like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle all right the lever arm and how it changes that could be an important idea other things that we might be able to change to vary or test anything else we might be thinking of kate on the angle right there ah yes the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with there s a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it so the angle of launch and changing that could be important anything else we might try anything else we could change we ve had some really good ideas all right so i d like to break you into your small groups and i d like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test we ll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information so i need you to prove your loyalty me huns build this trebuchet and test it and if attila the hun were here right now he d say what are you doing laying your duffs get to work huns let s get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet and you can choose whatever it is that interests you you can choose something that we did or something different but what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work you have to decide i m going to change this part of it and keep everything the same until we take data remind me first of all what it was you were changing counterweight counterweight so you re leaving the same object that you re launching we re just changing counterweight so what is that your weight yes okay so what challenges did you have if any in building this to test your counterweight we had problems with the sling and the pouch like at first we made it really long so like that didn t really work it didn t go anywhere it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself it s kind of like too long so like it so a little engineering before you could quite get one to work but you did then eventually get one by changing the shortening the string and shortening the sling yeah all right so at that point then it looks like you had some data and you took several trials was there anything just off the end any pattern you happened to notice just as you were taking the data we noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like it would float and then just kind of fall so there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it yeah like our data we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like really far to like back again what if i wanted to know not 600 grams or 650 but 625 how could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond if i wanted to know what s going to happen at 775 make a graph or an equation yeah actually either of those would work coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph to me the graph is a very visual way of doing it you could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it s some other sort of a curve all right and that will allow us to look at other data points which i think would be very helpful so your job then between now and wednesday is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were from your trebuchet without sharing all of the numbers but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found i think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down i think that s very interesting the fact that it s consistent so help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data okay all right we can do that hello ready to share trebuchet here s our data okay so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing we were looking for the angle the angle okay and when you were trying to build your trebuchet what challenges if any did you have in trying to test this angle well when we were doing it we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable so it couldn t be like super secure it had to be we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks so it was really easy to move okay it wasn t a super intense trebuchet but it works yeah we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks now i m not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century but i think no like twigs twigs we ll do it with twigs that s a good idea alright so then it looks like you took some data at different angles and you figured out then the range that it went was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data it s okay to say no yeah we noticed you d want to start it like farther back like there d be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle right because then it s because if it was positive it wouldn t really go anywhere starting with angles that made sense that you knew would give you enough energy to start it all right and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try that the farther back you went the greater length that it would go so the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range yes that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one now what limited you or was there a limit you stopped at negative 45 could you have gone negative 50 or no that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small it wasn t like high up to go all the way back ah okay all right you were commenting on being high up when we get together on wednesday and we talk about conclusions we ll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do where if you took the same model but just lift it up lifted it up adapted it see if that would matter all right that sounds good so we ve got several angles to comment on if i wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees or negative 35 or at negative 50 is there some way i could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose yeah you could probably think of an average you wouldn t assume that it would be like 100 accurate we wouldn t guarantee that but it would give a good idea all right so if you did some averaging work if you did some been thinking of actually not so much averaging you could even set it up like like side by side like triangles okay okay so figuring out maybe the ratios yeah that s that you should get here using your when you say your size and dimensions all right and that is an analysis that is so legitimate these are equations you can come up with you do have the option of doing it visually that is with a graph where you have your angles one direction and your range the other just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far you may find that there isn t enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you re certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that s easily recognizable so you get to choose however you want to analyze your data when we come together on wednesday i will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one some groups will find that there s no conclusion that the so that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers so that s your job for wednesday and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test also a bonus that we can measure data okay all right thank you good job the farthest range it was 650 grams for the counterweight six five zero yeah alrighty so that s good so we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that all right very good fifth group tell us about your data and your trebuchet okay our variable was the angle of launch as well angle okay that s good and we analyzed it visually basically and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was the larger the range was the larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that not really it just kind of continues as long as you continue to increase the angle you increase the range so you mean like the angle of release of the sling or the like how far back the arm goes before you let it go how did you measure your angle oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up the larger the distance was okay so the larger the angle to platform like what other angle could we have used the back arm okay and this one was how far we pulled it back yeah so isn t that the same angle then yeah but we just measured it inside all right all right so slightly different perspectives we ve all found angles on all right our sixth group we varied the counterweight also okay counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data we made a chart and a graph okay so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed what did you graph we graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range that s reasonable the counterweight versus range all right and as you examined your chart and the graph data what did you come up with as a conclusion the more weight we put on the further the range was was there an upper limit or not not from the amount of weight that we tested i mean i would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle then it would probably would have bad results so that actually gives us a place to go in future if we were to try to add more to the slab that might be something kind of interesting to find out is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail that might make a difference with our big trebuchet we want the biggest one that was successful were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet josh the angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot all right and in fact if we were to combine that with your counterweight we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would ve liked to have added to or varied steph when the sling did release we could never really tell where it did and we couldn t really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it s supposed to so you could never really tell,0.0
okay so if you re having trouble seeing it you can go back in with a regular pencil brush visible enough for you you can go back in and make it lighter but right now the mark makings you re doing is really good as you want to turn if you re having trouble making curved lines you can turn oh okay all right that helps instead of turning the tool turn the plate and keep pulling towards you okay it might make it a little bit easier to make those curves yeah they re really tough to do other than that it s been fine good is that working now that you what we talked about yesterday with this little yeah shadow i thought it was kind of okay and the same thing that i just told kim if you re having trouble with the curved lines you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve all right but so far what you re doing is good you re adding all these different values continue with that type of texture on the edges because that s working i m just going that s okay be patient have you decided yet how you re gonna treat this area in here no i m probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing okay so adding a different texture are you leaving the text i never i forgot to reprint it so if i do decide you ll just have to reverse the text yeah i know and i ll right add it in that s fine i think i ll just decide it later yeah finish your whole overall design first yes exactly and then if you want the text in it as long as it s reversed so you print it the right way yeah you can just reprint it okay sounds good awesome yeah so you re just yeah all right the way you re doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it s consistent do i have to make it identical no well what do you think are these identical persons it s like supposed to be but i know i m not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but i think it would look fine if it was different i kinda want it to look a little messy you want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one i don t think there s anything wrong with making them separate i know that they re trying to be echoing each other symmetrically yeah but all of the textures can be different okay to add some interest to it i think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side right don t you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway yeah definitely that s good how did you decide that you re going to treat the inside of the mouth area are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light well there s supposed to be some tongue over here but over here i m gonna make it like i m gonna try to go solid black in some parts like i tried to do that inside the mouth yeah that s good that s good i want mine to seem so then all of those areas then will stay dark yeah it ll create a nice shadow excellent that s really good are you gonna go off the edge yeah nice that s really good keep it up and emily how s yours coming yeah the same thing all those little dark areas that you re working on inside in between teeth now that you ve carved out all that area it s gonna create a darkened tone and as i mentioned before all the different stippling areas that s really good it s adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure if you re finding that it s easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table okay good good this is good i m getting confused of where i m going because if i did the backgrounds this is the negative space that i do the crosshatching then it would have to continue down here so you want to decide all the different types of textures that you re using in between all of it yeah all right so you ve got a little bit of the crosshatching here okay and you re using illustrative lines over here so you wanna try and find something in between that s a little bit different right uh huh well you haven t done any stippling texture yet i was working on in here okay so in here s gonna be stippling so right then this can t be the stippling because it s gonna be next to it i was thinking of here kind of moving this pattern down and then maybe just sort of okay i think that would be a good solution to that it s like this area in the background okay now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid and then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture you can go back into it and add it again okay okay so in here like you said follow the movement of these objects okay this is all the chain inside the bike so following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture and then in here just because you have all this texture in here you might not need to put anything else there okay what s your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra yeah it s hard to tell because i m not sure how it s gonna look when it s printed but i think that might be good because it would get kind of crazy i think it might be nice to have and you wanna still have it have a focal point so if you go crazy with other textures in here you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work okay i m having a hard time seeing it so you i might need to get one of those blue sheets okay the blue sheets are working i think you know what emily s been using the table so maybe that helps her to see her white lines that has been helping so if you don t wanna use one of those blue sheets you can do what she s doing and use the table yeah i ll do that i think i wanna lift it off of the book so you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines okay okay you re still working on your design right yeah i think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon yeah because once you figure out what s going on over here yeah i just have to yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong so what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas are you gonna fill them in too yeah i think so okay then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it engraving it i don t know i don t know if i should do really fine crosshatching mm hmm but then should i put a new texture on these what do you think do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print because i think if i texture both of them it ll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture okay so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first you can decide if they re too solid then you can go back in with a different texture okay okay so finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later okay room 221 students enter through a small entryway to their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom this classroom is shared by two teachers storage space is limited in this room i teach three sections of photography advanced placement studio art and advanced placement art history as we open up into the main part of the classroom storage areas are visible for each class photographic prints a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives as i pan the room you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible bulletin boards are set up for project instructions visual examples and critique displays along the back of the room is a dry mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies in the center of the room the printing press is stored for ap studio art and set up to allow for safe and organized used along the right hand side of the room there is a drawing rack for students to store work in progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives there is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents the file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders the large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies and at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept and at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use the projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions some of you are ready to print so i wanted to go through the actual printing press process today some of you might even be ready to try that today if you re not ready to try it right after i do the demonstration you can go back to your etching or engraving and then by tomorrow you ll be able to run it through the press before i do that i wanted to share something with you that s a little exciting and the fact that i actually have a relative who was a professional engraver my grandfather was an engraver he started in the 1930s and 40s after world war ii he was part of something called the gi bill does anybody know what that is oh i do yeah what is it they pay people to go to college yes exactly yeah after the world war ii veterans came back from war the government paid for them to go to college and he went to a college called the art students league which i was just talking with alex about and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver i m going to pass some of these around these are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you you can take some of those so you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time a hundred years at least or even more but this is from the early 30s and 40s these engravings and these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that i explained that we don t do here because of the safety you re doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid so i m going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that i m passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we re working with today and it s kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this so i m going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him all right so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print making ink so for the most part we re going to start with black today but you can choose any color that you want so you can see some of the examples that i put up here from past students one student decided instead of putting black ink on the white ground he used white ink on black ground so that s another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process so all the steps that we re going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week it s going to remind you of all the steps so the first step after you ve beveled all the edges in your plate that i demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print making ink and all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you re ready you ll take a little bit of print making ink and put it on the plate like this just like that and you ll use a tool called a brayer and the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate so once your brayer is filled with the ink you ll apply it to the plate and i m actually using my grandfather s plate from several years ago all right so you ll gently apply the ink over the entire plate okay just take a seat and i ll hand it out all right and after you have the entire plate inked you ll check and make sure that you didn t miss any spots all right notice that i missed a spot there so i m going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered once you have all the areas covered and this is just in interest of time i ll just show you the next step once the entire plate is covered you ll take a small piece of mat board i ll just use this instead okay i have little pieces of mat boards for you okay so you re going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that i have cut up here after you apply the entire ground with ink you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that s going to be on your inside lines this has a dual purpose it removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate this has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you re done this will push all the ink in the surface okay and then once you get most of it removed then you can take the cheesecloth i found one of my mat boards here we go all right so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink and then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front this will lift the ink off pretty easily and after you do this process this is the messy process so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you re done with this before we move to the printing press i ll show you how to do that sometimes a circular motion with this will help so i m going to show so you can all see circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface i m showing you this quickly all the steps but i have one prepared for us to print with just like a cooking show so it s ready to go all right so you re going to use flat on the table i m showing you this so you can see it but you re going to do all of this flat at your desk get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth if you run out of space you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again then the last step before you clean your edges at this point if you want to go clean your hands so you don t get it on anything again you could go clean your hands as well we ll take a piece of newsprint a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper the newsprint works the best so i have cut up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice smooth surface and before you re ready to print you could take a q tip dip it in some water and then clean your edges so the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates you should take the q tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean so this print was left up here for a reason it doesn t have a clean edge i wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn t clean their edge okay this has a nice clean edge this has a little bit of ink left on the edge so when you pull a perfect print you want to make sure you have a clean edge and the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off,0.0
why do they keep getting colder why do they keep getting warmer they add water to it maybe they add water to it okay what else the thermometer what about the thermometer they could have lights lights well did they turn off the lights afterwards okay at this point at that point maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it the thing is ultimately are we gonna know what they did unless i was video taping you during that whole process there are a couple things i wanna point out here in a second i think several of the ideas are possibilities what happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially what do you need to do as soon as you put it in there what do you need to do do you immediately start taking readings yes everybody agrees we immediately start taking readings as soon as we put it down in there like the first second we start taking readings we take a thermometer put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings like what s the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point okay so we need a starting point what were you going to say if you put it in there like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature it wouldn t change immediately yes so it goes 22 21 19 18 it s going down so what could have been the issue here they took it at the very beginning good good they just didn t wait long enough look at this one i saw this in one particular group because by the way you guys realize you were doing some very very different things right as we were doing and collecting this data there were some major differences what could have happened what was going on here just the obvious stuff observation what s the difference in the pattern yes ma am the hot water is like consistent like it s just gonna stay at the current temp hot water stays hot right cold water is doing what increasing in temperature it s increasing in temperature the room temperature water is doing what it stays the same with this same group i just happened to catch this cold water luke warm water the person was doing this this is the warm water oh laughs body heat keeping it warm insulating it what was happening transfer of heat we re gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks this doesn t seem like a big deal right i mean would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this you ve gotta start thinking like scientists though because that could be a huge deal if we re doing something with temperature right okay good well the obvious or the observation what s going on with the cold water it s increasing it s increasing okay luke warm water staying the same the hot water it s getting cold it s getting cold okay what s different from the first slide yes the hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water did it actually happen to somebody did it actually happen yeah let s do this first let s go back to here what word would you use to describe what s going on here what s all this heading towards room temperature it s all headed towards room temperature there s a fancy word that starts with an e we may have talked about this last year the fancy word the idea there s a word i want you to walk away with the word is equilibrium okay how does this show equilibrium rebecca how does this show equilibrium with the hot water how does this show equilibrium rebecca it s sierra it all goes toward the same it s kind of like the hot is increasing and it s temperature the hot is what i m sorry i meant the cold the cold is increasing in it s temperature and then it s going towards the room temperature it s going towards room temperature the hot is decreasing in temperature and it s going towards the room temperature also is this what we would expect all right so what happened because i don t have any idea what happened here yes in some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out so maybe that one cup was under a lot of air we do have some powerful air vents what do you guys think is that that s a huge amount any other ideas yeah i think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature down for a hot cup is it possible there s human error here and they just they looked at the wrong thing maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot so there s mixing the water thermometers maybe just read them wrong so you guys think some kind of human error then yes yes let s go back to this and let s go to the next step kind of like what we ve done in the past i want you to think of this at an atomic level a molecular level what s happening here in order to do that we re gonna play with bbs i ve got enough sets of bbs here each group is gonna have a set of bbs all right so group up a little closer together alright so you two maybe go around you guys here s what i want you to do within your group one half have one set actually the two of you can marcus good here s what i want you to do the bbs will be what atoms atoms and molecules okay are atoms and molecules just sitting no when we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower faster when we take away energy they re going to go slower or rather than take away when they release it i m gonna give you a couple minutes i want you to talk within your groups i want you to be able to do three things i m gonna call people up here in a second i m gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your bbs i want you to be able to simulate the top line the middle line and the bottom line so getting cooler room temperature staying the same and getting warmer i also want kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium all right talk to each other real quick some are getting cooler some are getting hotter some are staying the same temperature and how would you show equilibrium i ll give you about a minute or two all right everybody take a look at your bbs hands off bbs i got a volunteer what were the bbs again atoms atoms and we re trying to show what movement towards equilibrium movement towards equilibrium what energy energy and movement how those go together energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it okay everyone take a look at the chart here s the graph show me the top line and tell me what you re doing make it faster because it s hotter it decreased because it s going down and getting less heat okay so it s gonna start the bbs are going to start going fast and then slowing down slowing down could you show us yeah we re in an awkward spot getting warmer the bottom part of that chart at first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it s getting warmer thank you i m gonna do room temperature i think room temperature would be this and it stays the same kenny what well it s gotta be moving right room temperature would just be this and i have to do what oh i probably should have picked the same group the two of you working together how could you show us equilibrium of going towards equilibrium she s going to do cold okay and you re going to do hot okay good now time out what did you do or were you not done i started out fast and she started out slow why did you start out fast because i was hot and you were cold cold and lauren what did you do the same speed which was getting close to equilibrium show us one more time good who disagrees nobody good thank you here we go keep going a couple more things real fast most of you guys had this going about six seven eight nine anywhere from six seven to 15 minutes of data if we did this for an hour what would this look like they would eventually all be on the same line for a while and it would be pretty boring so this would keep going well what would be the lowest point room temperature this would be the highest point then this would still continue the same what s the word equilibrium here s how all this started this whole lab that you guys put together and created it s a demo here s how it all started i asked you a question yesterday a couple days ago jar bag with some water in it scarf although i told you gloves and then aluminum foil we came up we felt all four of these things and you made a predic well the question was if we put these outside left them there overnight you look outside your window,0.0
where do i have more potential energy at position a or position b matt position a why because it s fully stopped before it s there it s already moving a little bit what else why does this point here point a have more potential energy than point b so this is a this is b does everyone agree that position a has more potential energy raise your hand if you agree with that okay now who can tell me why why does position a have more potential energy than position b it has more potential to do work why has potential to do work yes why it has a greater height it has a greater height who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class i did okay so going back to gpe when you have a pendulum swinging back and forth types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy and potential energy specifically we can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy if you focus your attention here what is that a pendulum a pendulum similar to what you have here actually you guys within the next week you ll actually be working with the simulation it s effect simulation they re online they re free for you to use and they re nice because they allow you to play i know you like to a play a lot i like to play yes matt you will be working with this but i just wanted to show you another application of this just in a different format when we swing the pendulum what s going to happen it s gonna move it s going to move and at point here and here let s say a and b what type of energy is being represented potential potential energy who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented you wanna come up sure between a and b so every place along the path between a and b does everyone agree with ali yes yes okay where is gravitational potential energy at its max wanna go up and point at points a and b right so everyone agree on the two ends where would kinetic energy be at its max where is kinetic energy at its max right here why because it s lowest what else so we said here let s label this point c we already used a and b why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here that s when the potential energy is at its lowest great that s where potential energy the gravitational potential energy is at its lowest and if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula what does the formula state what variables involved in the kinetic energy formula matt mass and velocity mass and velocity what can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it s swinging along its path back and forth from a to b what can we infer about the kinetic energy it s terminal velocity is well we re not gonna say terminal velocity the object isn t falling it s attached what can we conclude about the velocity at point c any thoughts garrett greatest it s at its greatest when the pendulum is at this point it stops at each point a and b our two end points it stops for a split second because it has to do what maddy did you say it turn around it has to turn around when it swings back down what s happening to the velocity is it increasing or decreasing increasing so if the velocity is increasing what s gonna happen to the kinetic energy value it s also going to increase now if i show you a graphical representation who can describe the graphical representation like a downward okay ali as it moves i guess it swings back and forth the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point it s the highest and then when it reaches points a and b the potential energy gets highest so does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with yes yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy i can stop it at certain areas sometimes it comes out better than others it is somewhat on its way back but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy and if i m really good i can maybe try and get it in the middle close enough it s hard to stop it right in the center but you notice that the potential energy does what decreases and your kinetic energy will increase increase rather and you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point c one other factor that s involved here there is one other type of energy or form of energy that s involved can anyone think of it celini thermal thermal energy mechanical mechanical thermal thermal garrett you had your hand up thermal thermal who agrees with thermal raise your hand wait actually no is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum no that s mechanical thermal if you re saying thermal energy what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum what is the pendulum doing right now it s moving through the air air when objects move through the air what can occur or what is present air resistance which is a form of friction friction is or is not friction an example of heat energy is or thermal energy yes so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present yes yes now how come it s not showing up on the graph there s no friction there s no friction so what i like about this and like i said you guys will be using the simulation and one of the options you have is to change the value for friction right now i have no friction so it s not showing up on the grid so if i increase the friction you re going to see how the value for thermal energy will change also when you apply or work with the simulation you can actually change the mass of the ball or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself and those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days so let s add some friction let s go about halfway what s happening to the friction it s increasing it s increasing on every swing it s increasing with every swing and the pendulum is not reaching points a and b anymore and the what it s not reaching points a and b anymore why what s happening here we have all these types of forms of energy what s happening the air resistance slowing it down the air resistance could be slowing it down want a little more falls away lots of friction and what s gonna happen ali losing particles it s not losing particles i m not losing any mass we re not changing the mass we re not changing the particles if there s a great deal of friction it s losing energy it slows down does it lose energy how many of you think it loses energy raise your hand how many of you think otherwise what happens to the energy that was present we had colorful bars matt said it s colorful we had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy now we have these great big red bars representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now what happened in this simulation ali i don t know that but because in the definition of thermal energy that s the total potential or kinetic energy in an object so there is potential and kinetic energy involved yes steven you wanna try and help him out the energy gets transferred to thermal exactly the energy gets transferred to thermal energy what does the word transfer mean or transform what does that mean you know the movie transformers you guys are not too young for that right i had a transformer i did jessica it changes it changes if we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened what could we say that we learned about the energies involved what would be the main concept the thing you just learned which steven and jessica proceeded what happened to the energies who can restate what they just stated matt or maybe give a definition energy is transferred but not lost okay energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost so what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy would you agree with that statement raise your hand if you agree and what does the word transform mean bella change good change so you changed we began with what kind of energy at this position elaine potential potential ailsa it changed to kinetic kinetic it changed to potential potential changed back to kinetic kinetic and we also have some thermal energy involved is everyone clear on that concept what you re going to do with your group get out a sheet of paper a piece of scrap paper or you could use the back of your packet is fine there s a blank spot on there one paper per group per group okay what you re going to do i m showing you two objects i brought in props for you guys today real life this is my toaster from home aw is it a brave little toaster what i want you to do you have two examples stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in it is turned on the blades are moving what i want you to do to these two objects i want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects but what i want you to do is take it a step further i want you to tell me or place in order what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed so you begin with you might have a thought what type of energy do i begin with in order for the toaster to work what type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on and i want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation you re gonna get about two to three minutes to do this i would like every person in the group to participate you all should be able to share your ideas freely respect what other people are saying and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies any questions before you begin any questions okay see it like stops here like that s potential energy and well if you look at the fan i purposely turned it on so the blades are doing what they re moving are they doing work yes base your forms or types of energy on what you see the blades are moving it is turning okay if you want to list the energy you begin with put an arrow put the next form of energy put an arrow put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that s involved with the two objects is it turning right now do you all agree on that i would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that wait wait wouldn t they both be nuclear energy nuclear energy yes because it s think about your definition of here you put the energy for toaster i would write it down sucked in i don t have the jolt in that look i don t have the toaster plugged in don t burn yourself but let s look and observe three of you do you feel anything yes do you see all those little black pointy things when you put something in there and you turn it on i don t know what you call those things but they like the coil yeah the coil yeah yes they do that s how you generate the heat if you had the toast it would turn on how about in the oven coils inside what colors do they turn orange they turn orange the same thing they turn orange so do you think that there s a form of energy involved here yeah magnetic that s right oh but you discovered it on your own,0.0
tell them what you wrote describe your three pictures and then they re going to share what they saw and the three pictures they picked the cat i picked the roller coaster man what did you get for what i only did two i think the earth y all did the roller coaster max is that possible why not what did you write there s no gravity so in that picture he s weightless but where is he in front of a building so he s on a planet right yeah so what should happen if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video he s falling he should fall right all right write that down next to that picture i don t mean to do that all right so let s look at the roller coaster he couldn t even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down so that s why why he wouldn t fall like that and that s either like strange stuff but i don t think he could fall like that unless he he can t fall like that that s impossible get his weight and yeah exactly cause he can t do that yeah cause you can see his shadow under that and don t think he i think he got like a hoop or something so like a little string or something or like he fall yeah cause he can t do that they must have took that while he was cause that s impossible earth s gravity pulling him like that unless he in space or something all right so why would he fall because the force of gravity pushing down so why would he fall that way and not fall that way the gravity would push him down and not up so there s like there s gravity on earth so like if you consider like how newton found the apple when it fell to the ground okay so you know there s something going on that s pulling you down and you say what if you were on the other side of the earth would it be pulling you up then if you were on the other side or would it still pull you down to the ground it would still pull you down to the ground all right so on the planet what can we say about gravity where is it trying to pull you to the center ah to the center so it doesn t matter where you stand it s not pulling you down it s just trying to pull you where to the center to the center okay all right one more minute for sharing make sure you have three pictures described on your t chart if you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor do that now and you got the solar system okay so it says planets can move because of gravity where are they moving around the sun and what has them go in a circle and not flying away all right who would like to share what they wrote with their group their favorite one their favorite picture all right arquel which one was your favorite picture the roller coaster roller coaster who picked roller coaster all right so let s all look at the roller coaster and arquel tell us what your team wrote down and sarah will add it to our list we had put that the gravity brings the speed to the to the roller coaster so if you wanted to make the speed increase you would want to bring your hill higher so therefore the the speed will increase and it ll go faster all right so arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster so if you want a faster roller coaster you need to build a higher roller coaster did anybody write anything different for roller coaster carlos what did you write oh the same thing but the steepness of the hill when it s going down it increases its velocity and it s more g s all right so he says the steeper the hill more velocity more g s what s a g let s have carlos try first then we can help him out if he needs help what s a g you said g yeah a g is a pull okay so it s a pull adriana you want to add to it it s a force pushing against you all right pushing against you anybody else want to add to that it s a pull its a force it s pushing against you how do we get a g force what do you think austin you have a push or pull you have excess friction air accelerates push or pull excess friction arquel all the forces together all the forces put together on you okay so let s write g force down and put a question cause we re still not sure what that is maybe we can get there so we re not sure quite what a g is but we know it has something to do with gravity all right let s pick another picture who had a favorite picture that we haven t talked about that wasn t a roller coaster what was your favorite picture greg the dude the dude who is the dude he has a name we know who that is who is that enrique johnson it was newton right what was newton s first name not john isaac issac there we go issac newton all right and what does the dude say isaac newton what s he saying what s his quote not that dude this one oh the floating dude okay the floating dude he d rather talk about the floating dude above isaac newton okay so let s look at the guy floating in the middle of the air he looks like he s planking is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture no greg why do you say this is impossible because the earth s gravitational pull right okay so he says the earth s gravitational pull what like this wouldn t work because when you pull okay he should be being pulled down to the center of the earth why do you say the center cause that s where the gravitational pull s coming from cause that s where all the gravity wants to take you and that s where all the gravity s coming from i like that answer anybody want to add to it vanessa but if you have pressure against both forces you could possibly stay up longer okay so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer chloe force where would that force come from your body so how could he if he s not touching the ground make himself float what s underneath you that you don t see gravity well we don t see gravity but what s underneath him it s around us right now air the air right so let s think about the air if we could make the air thicker what would we also increase the gravity not the gravity we re trying to go against the force of gravity the weight the force against our weight what s that called let s think about a boat floating in the water bouyance bouyant force right so if you could increase the bouyant force of the air and vanessa said if you could make that strong enough you should be able to float does anyone know a planet where there s more thick clouds than we have here it s our neighbor mars he has clouds who has clouds who has thick clouds jarissa venus venus yeah is that what you were going to say venus has super thick clouds right and if we could go there maybe there d be enough air underneath you that you could float in the air if they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body okay all right anymore for the floating guy did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air i know that karima and anthony had a good answer what did you guys write down anthony put that i put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the earth and it will like like it would it pulls you to the center of the earth and what did we decide about where you stand on earth like on the other side so what would happen if you went to the other side of the earth would it still pull you the same way or is it going to pull you an opposite way the same way the same way where is it always going to pull you down towards the center to the center to the middle okay it doesn t matter what planet you stand on doesn t matter where you are it s trying to take you to the center of the object okay so why do we get stuck to the earth and that the earth s stuck to us in this picture cause the earth s solid and it doesn t let us go out into the okay so he said the earth is solid are we solid yes hmm okay so maybe it s not that we re solid cause maybe there s something else going on what do you think carlos the earth has more mass than us the earth has more mass than us jenny what s mass mass is well all of us then we all have it how would you give a definition of mass what is it about us the type of weight it s the type of weight okay we re on the right track who wants to help her out what s mass the amount of density amount of density okay we re getting better jarissa the amount of space that it takes well what would that be what s your space volume okay so space is volume we re still trying to figure out what s mass we ve heard some density words we ve heard volume words what do you think ky the amount of electrons oh we re getting closer so it s your electrons your atoms ah your atoms so it s how many atoms you have inside your body that s your mass so now someone else said weight so let s go back to that how do you get weight so you stand on the scale how do you know your weight what is going on what do you think hakeem pounds we measure it in pounds okay so how do me measure it how do you get pounds what s happening to your mass what happens when you stand on the scale what is it measuring your weight your weight so then how do we figure that out what s going on what s going on on a scale carlos the gravity is pushing you down gravity is pushing you down so what happens to your weight if you have more mass you re heavier you re heavier so your weight how would we give a description of weight now we know mass is how many atoms you have we know volume is how much space you take up so now what s weight carlos has kind of said it for us how would we put it as a definition it s the pull of what on your mass gravity pull of gravity so let s look at the guy in the picture again if this was going to be true what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float would he be allowed to have a mass on earth hakeem says no vanessa says yes if you re going to float and there s gravity always trying to pull you down in order to float what do we have to do with our mass decrease our mass okay so let s think about if we go to another planet with our weight does your mass change if you go to another planet yes no do all of a sudden you have more atoms in you no depending on the gravity what did you say you have the same atoms but your weight and mass changes you said the same amount of atoms so your weight and mass changes but if you have the same amount of atoms isn t your mass the same yeah okay so what s the only thing that would change jarissa the gravity the gravity so then what would that change about your weight would it change or would it stay the same it would change it will change so what can we say if we went to a smaller planet you ll become lighter you ll become lighter why because it has less gravity has less gravity so less pull you weight less okay so let s put weightless next to g force as another word we should look up ready all right so what i want you to do now using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about i want you to flip your paper over and in the circle i would like you to try with your partner to write a definition for what you think gravity is i ll give you one minute you and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is and write that in your circle back make sure you guys share that okay a lot of weight or what s the other word of how many atoms you have what s it pulling on very good so it pulls on your mass and think about where it s trying to pull oh that s a good definition of gravity try to write your definition on your paper make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper pulls what pulls the weight you almost said it mass mass make sure you guys share that okay you guys done okay so what is gravity it s a force so that means it s a what a a short pull gravity s pulling us right okay so what s so what do you think is it pushing or pulling pushing pulling ooh we have a disagreement better figure out which ones right okay so it s a pull so where is it trying to take you to and what is it trying to take about your your definition all right what are you having i wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center okay so the word i want you to make sure we say is invisible cause we ll talk about that okay all right so let s share our definitions who would like to share their definition first all right ky we put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle all right gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle so sarah can you add that to the circle arquel what did you guys write gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the earth and it wants to the mass okay so you added mass to that okay so it s pulling on mass what do you want to add angel i want to add to kyle s answer that it s invisible invisible so let s think about what we learned about forces if it s invisible you can t see it is it touching you yes or is it everywhere it s everywhere everywhere so is it a contact force or a non contact force non contact why do you say that israel because it s not touching you it s not touching you so even if you re floating in outer space will gravity still be there yes what do you think carlos yes you say yes so those astronauts will they still feel some gravity even though they re out at the space station what do you think angel outer space has some gravity but greater than that s why they wouldn t feel it what do you think it depends on we have mass so far but the strength of gravity also depends on something else we have mass but what could it also depend on vanessa force okay gravity is a force angel was getting there he was saying that it s still pulling on you it s just not as strong the weight that s mass we talked about mass and weight trying to get the other thing that s going to control gravity how big the planet is okay so that s mass let s think about the astronauts who are not as close to the earth are they weightless they have the same amount of mass their mass didn t change but they went farther away from the earth so why are they weightless why do they float what s the other factor going on with gravity moving away from the center of the earth so what do we call that has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on we have mass and we re looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity what do you guys think if i m really far away from jarissa am i able to grab her as much as if i was closer no if i go real close to her is it easier for me to pull on her yes but what happens if i go far away i have the same mass my mass doesn t change can i reach her as easily now no so what s the other thing going on with gravity distance distance so if you re far away from the earth can gravity pull on you as hard no no but the closer you get the little bit stronger little bit stronger so then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on earth but i don t feel the sun we re closer to the earth than we are the sun so we re going to feel the earth before we would feel the sun but now if we left the planet we started going somewhere else say i was going to mars what would happen the closer i got to mars who would start pulling me now mars the mars center of its planet would start to pull me okay so let s look at the picture of the planets thinking about pulling to the center why in the picture of the planets is the sun in the middle of all the planets because it s the biggest oh it s the biggest one we got a couple of different answers so let s share with our neighbor first see if you know why the sun is in the center you got 30 seconds it s got the biggest mass it got the biggest mass and it s the biggest so like it got the most gravitational pull that s why it s in the middle all right marco why do you think the sun is in the center of our solar system because i don t know you don t know okay javier what do you think you re his partner what did you guys talk about based on what we just talked about why would the sun go in the center it has more mass it has more mass so what does it also have more gravity so he s always going to be in the middle right what if we had a bigger star come our way like what about a black hole say one of our neighbors blew up one of our,0.0
get out your journal i ll read it aloud and i ll put the time on the timer get our your journal we re looking at journal entry number 14 and you re not allowed to write i don t know take a guess if you re not sure but don t write i don t know so question 14 is very simple why do you think an earthquake happens you can write it you can draw a picture so i m asking you why do you think an earthquake happens you have three minutes right now to write what you think why do you think an earthquake happens why do you think an earthquake happens and why do you think remember there s no right or wrong it s what you think is the answer remember you can draw a picture if that helps you okay if you want to draw alright you ve got like a minute left so you can draw a picture write down what you think i m gonna give you about 30 more seconds many of you are still writing and that s fine but i thought before we talk about this let s take a look at a little clip because i realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake so this one s kinda cool it was shot obviously on somebody s iphone so it s not the best quality but many of you know that japan has lots of earthquakes all the time they re very used to earthquakes so this person lives in japan and so again they re used to earthquakes right so they weren t like panicking so he actually took his iphone and filmed the ground so i want you to take a look we re only gonna look at about a minute of it but i want you to notice how the ground is moving okay and we re gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen so this is pretty cool so this was back in march 2011 so notice now they re gonna go to another part notice the ground in the back watch the back you ll see something happen watch what s happening alright so that s real it s not like there was a machine underneath there doing that so you guys we can solve what s happening so let s take that and let s talk about this through why do you think an earthquake happens why do you guys think an earthquake happens and remember when we talk we re gonna let one person go at a time and we re gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear alright so let s just start on this side we re gonna work this way tony what did you write why do you think an earthquake happens well i think there s something wrong with the mantle that s coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake okay something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate also i liked how you used a complete sentence so remember if you re not sure there s some sentence starters up there jheyline what did you write i think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other excellent because plate boundaries overlap each other jose i think that earthquakes happen when plates crash when plates crash together anybody else adrian and then dajana i think that earthquakes happen because plates slide because plates slide excellent dajana i think an earthquake happens from too much stress also i think the plate boundaries overlap ooh i like what you said and that s exactly where i m going next so in that video clip you guys saw the ground move i m gonna give you 10 seconds and that 10 seconds you re gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move what direction was that ground moving so you have 10 seconds share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you go 10 seconds alright finishing up in five four three two one zero okay so i heard lots of people talking so i m gonna pull a name this time remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said so what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip let s see now neferly what kind of movement did you see they were moving apart good moving apart what else did you notice angel they were moving apart moving apart what else did you notice dajana well it was crashing everywhere but i saw the ooh kind of like water coming out of the sky josh what else did you notice oh so a little bit of up and down movement alright so up and down movement anybody else notice any other type of movement so you guys said up and down you said moving apart oh did you see how that piece literally slid yeah alright so that s movement you guys know some words for this what are some words that we ve learned to describe movement and dajana said a couple what words jina shearing yes so there was some shearing happening what else was happening rodolfo tension yes some tension pulling apart and what else did you notice daniel compression yeah compression squeezing together okay so we re getting this idea that didn t dajana you said it was stress or you said stress dajana right so something about stress being kind of important so we re gonna take that idea give us a moment okay thanks alright so sorry about the interruption so stress dajana was saying stress so let me give you an example so let s imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band let s imagine that it s a rock and let s imagine it s a rock i know it s a rubber band but let s imagine it s a rock so i m gonna take i m gonna go like this it s a rock remember so i m doing this to the rock and then i m gonna stand here for an entire year and then a year from now i m gonna put my hands further apart and then another year i m gonna put my hands further apart what s happening to this rock or this rubber band what s happening to this rock over time what s happening lupita to this rock it s stretching it s stretching what else add to that tucker and stretching it out stretch is added to it stress is added too nice victor so maybe it s getting a little compression okay maybe a little compression too my hands are getting tired tony continental drift ooh like okay so if there were other pieces like my hands were africa and south america they d be moving apart ernesto thinner in the middle thinner in the middle sakura tension so tension now i m gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt but what would happen if i kept doing that i m gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you what might happen if i kept doing that and i kept doing that and i kept doing that what might happen to this rubber band or this rock so 10 seconds to the person next to you ten seconds alright finishing up in five four three two one zero okay i heard lots of good discussion so if i kept doing this i kept doing it i kept doing it moses what might happen it might crack and break it might crack and break everyone what else maybe might happen victor it will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it ll break ooh oh i like cause you remember this a lot right little earthquake excellent tucker it s just like when you shove your fingers go all the way back it will break oh yeah that would be painful jheyline it d probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything did everybody hear that word she just said which word did you say it would explode explode wow that s a big powerful word but that s pretty equal to what happened right big amount of power or like when you were doing that with the rock like when you were moving it like it would get more thinner and get more it would kinda get wider when after all while it s still going it s gonna like good so let s step back a little bit so who was it someone had said earthquake right you had said earthquake so it s sounding like what if that happens first so before the earth actually moves before what we saw in the video what did you guys think was happening and moses had used the word for it too what was happening to the rocks over time so over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake what s happening over time ernesto what s happening over time it s stretching it s stretching keep going with that diego it was standing it was standing tony it s spreading apart spreading apart jheyline widening widening tiger breaking breaking so wait before the breaking though you guys were saying it was stretching it was pulling so what word can you describe it building up in here building up stephanie through stress ah okay so it sounds like if we re gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first we have said stress that builds right stress builds and then what s gonna happen when the stress builds and it builds and it builds and it builds and it can t take it anymore what s going to happen manuel collide this is stress keep going not collide what s another word that s kind of same idea so you said it when i was over here it s gonna keep stressing and stressing and what s gonna happen to the rock rip it ll what rip rip what s another word you can say it ll explode explode adrian break break great so there s going to be a rupture or a break and then is that it end of the story nice day that s it where does all this energy go right there s all this energy building up where does it go yeah it ruptures it breaks and then is it over no no what where what happened where did the energy go where did that energy go irma where d it go plate tectonics yeah it has to do with plate tectonics absolutely where did that energy go where did it go rodolfo plate boundaries yeah plate boundaries so okay we got stress builds ruptures it breaks and then is that it no that s the earthquake what action yeah anna it becomes an earthquake yeah it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience jheyline shaking shaking oh so it sounds like there s a rupture or a break and then that s gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released an earthquake it s an earthquake yes and what is that shaking actually being released so the shaking is released what victor all the stress yes it s releasing all the stress what s another word you could say releasing all of its power power is a good word or diego energy energy right so it seems like all an earthquake is is stress building up building up building up breaks and then we feel that what do we experience the energy as so what do we experience think of the energy as what do we experience it as an energy that that what s that shaking shaking right alright awesome so now we re gonna you guys did that perfectly so we re gonna write that down in our notes woah i know that earthquakes release energy right so that s what happens as a result so we are not in any way done with this because we are gonna talk all about different you guys have made a good start on what s happening so we are gonna take two notes today they re pretty short i m sorry the first one s a little long the other one s super short but this is what you guys were just telling me except now we re gonna add the word elastic strain which is what you guys were telling me you were telling me that energy was building up you were telling me stress was building up and that s gonna cause elastic strain yes dajana the pictures that you showed us what it only cut through the kind of yeah yes so like maybe cause on the bottom that came out of the ground yeah and then it just spilled it over then it came out of the ground yeah so thank you for those of you who got started rodolfo let me just read this off for people so our first topic today is earthquake energy and this is what we just talked about but now we re getting a chance to write it down and we re adding in a bigger word and that word is elastic strain so elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape so elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape okay so that s step one in an earthquake step two energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks so elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves and we will learn all about those next week but you can still write down you just think released energy travels and it s felt as shaking,0.0

and i m going to look at what number that is and i see that that is now your information that you get we re going to be writing in our chart here so do you see at the bottom of your page it has ramp with one book you re going to write the distance that your car moved now don t write 20 inches cause yours is going to be different okay you write how far your car went for ramp number one okay hold on just a second isabelle now i gave you guys numbers and the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment the number one person is going to set up the ramp so they re going to put the dictionary and the ramp get it all set up for the group the number two person is going to get to hold the car and let it go okay and then the number three person is going to measure the distance that it went okay close attention okay so you re going to all have a job to do now this is with the one dictionary when we do the experiment next we re going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes okay but for right now we re going to try just one dictionary are there any questions before we get started miguel like the first one goes first and then on the second thing like you try to set the number one does the second job and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job yes so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment okay so we don t need to fight over who gets to do the car and who can get that okay isabelle question but what if we do the same each of us what we do oh if that s what you get if you get 20 inches on yours then you write that down okay yes angie when you took no we re all going to talk to each other in nice friendly voices that s right okay max last question and then we need to get started are we going to use the rulers yes you re going to use the rulers and i know i didn t give those to the groups but i m going to pass those out right now okay can i have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group who s going to set up the ramp me okay you re number two start it in the corner it s a meter come on over here okay get your paper no but watch out don t do it awesome okay boys and girls once you get to your group you can go ahead and get started it looks farther and this group you may use this ruler okay measure it one right here and then here are you okay no from here from there there no ms sprano said from here nine inches no 11 11 11 inches it looks like eight wait is oh no it s eight remember what ms sprano said no she said from the front actually i said from the back good listening miguel so how far did the car go eight inches eight inches okay excellent so write down your information you ve got a pencil right here okay so the next step isabelle miguel and angie is you re going to try it with two dictionaries okay but number three is going to set it up look up at the chart to see who s going to set it up so who s setting it up um number two okay let s figure it out okay now go to your group for a second okay now is this how far going to yea till we go well wait a second are we measuring from the top of the ramp or are we measuring from the bottom so you re going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp and then measure to the end of the car so how far did that car go five no it s to the end of the car so how far did the car go two two inches now do you guys think that because you re on a thicker carpet that s going to change your results it should go up like that do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far yes yeah would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet yeah okay you can move to that carpet and see what the difference is and you guys will have to share that with the class okay so try it again with just one dictionary okay so then one have to let the car go guys we re going to try it with two dictionaries okay so look at the chart to see who s going to set it up next oh my god this is going to be loud we re good ms sprano she said from the very back you set it up no i mean you let go who s turn is it you re doing the first one who s number three we all have jobs to do who s number one okay so your job is to set up the ramp which you did a good job on number two person who s the number two person so giselle i m number three no she was two it s fine she s number three so giselle you re going to let the car go and look esmeralda is going to measure okay so excellent okay now put that down now which side do we need to start with very good and then we can spin it around there so now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet can you scoot it over some very good so how far did the car go seven inches good okay so let s write that down on our chart finish yours change this so it s seven inches okay now what s our next step what are we going to do next i don t know are we going to try it with two dictionaries okay so now who s going to set that up looks like the number two person so giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary so put one more dictionary on top okay good well number three is going to let the car go so now it s esmeralda s turn so you guys what do you think is going to happen do you think it s going to go farther or do you think it s going to be closer when you let go of the car right now what do you think is going to happen you think it ll fall down okay well let s see what happens woah did you see how far that went okay don t pick it now wait a second it s edgar s turn to measure so let s see how far did it go edgar so we measure to the 14 wow that went farther didn t it so your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries please go sit down in your group and raise your hand let s go sit down at our group the car s there 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half who knows how to write 15 and a half so number two would get to measure the distance on this one okay okay so let me see how you re doing here okay well can we try it again can we try it again so you re on the second experiment so number three who s the number three person he is jose s the number three person okay so jose get s to let it go should we move this out of the way or should we keep it here so are you number three no i m number one but number one set it up but then see oh okay so it looks like it s jose s turn to let the car go so hand the car no he sets up ramp can you go sit down please and i ll be right with you got it okay jose try it it s my car put it right here and let s see what happens okay let go excellent okay who s measuring me okay so let s measure now do we want it are we measuring with inches or centimeters no it s right we re doing it the right way don t worry did it go farther or was it closer okay so then i have a question for you guys listen if we put three dictionaries here do you think it s going to go farther or it s going to go closer farther you think it s going to be farther what do you think jose farther what do you think farther well okay we better check it out did you write down your numbers so for the second one it was 15 inches okay now we re on the last part that means the number three person sets up the ramp are you the number three person so set up the ramp where s your other dictionary okay so then we have to use the dictionary okay can you let go okay it s oh wow that might be pretty cool huh okay so devon it s your turn to let the car go and i like how you re moving all the stuff out of the way selena you want to stay there or do you want to move oh okay so who s turn is it to measure again no number one gets to you know what i think we mixed it up now selena lets go of the car and devon measures this time okay did you okay so maybe it s jose s turn okay go ahead ooh look how much it turned okay so measure how far it went okay so measure how far it went let s see what happened do we move the 17 try it again let s try it again okay let s see how are you guys doing you got all yours finished okay good okay well i haven t gone over that okay boys and girls raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments all three okay,0.0
so we go back remember this do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest okay what s happening is things are getting not broken up another example of that would be measure 16 to 17 you would not want to breathe at the end of 16 now i want to go back to 13 and i want you to do what we did yesterday where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties so what that does at 13 is it should da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daa da da da da da da da da da da da da dum okay it s kind of funny to do that on the bass drum so just play the regular part on the bass drum okay i can try to nah i d rather you not because it s going to muffle it s going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing try it at 13 everybody da da da da da da da working on accents one two and ready and go look at measure 15 da da daa da da da da what s happening is some of you are changing 15 to this tell me what s wrong with this anybody recognize what s wrong with that adrian you played four yeah i played four sixteenth notes and then i played a note on beat four it s got a one and two three e and up listen again here s the correct way oops wrong finger listen again try that measure 15 one and two and ready and go again more accent that last note s really short and it s really strong one two 15 and play now play it the way it s written but feel it the way you just played it that will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note one two ready and go and okay see how it places it very crisply let s go back to 13 play it break it down into the sixteenths da da da da da da da ready 13 we re going to go all the way through 20 one and two and ready and play and now i m going to get to what we are beginning to learn today i m going to go ahead and put my tie up here now is there anyone who can tell me what this is what is that daniel a dotted eighth note this is a dotted eighth note who can tell me what this note is sedekia one sixteenth note it is a sixteenth note so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot with that in mind can somebody tell me what the value of that note is cole it would last for like three beats three beats and then you would have a sixteenth note okay i think you re on the right track it would last for three of something but not three beats landon three fourths of a beat it would be three fourths of a beat so let s think about this remember an eighth note in 4 4 time gets half of a beat everybody what s half of a half one fourth one fourth so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat well that sounds a little bit complicated but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here so who can tell me what i would write for counts under this dotted eighth note raise your hand lydon would it be one e one e because that s the same as having three of both and jaylin what would go here a e okay so this is just another way of writing this let s do a measure of counting that ready and go and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and now i want all my first row to do that four times okay and go and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and second row ready and go and one e and a two and one e and a two,0.0
starter stopper opposite side okay everybody has their marbles how many trials are we doing five five trials if the first one doesn t work raise your hand i will come help you and we ll talk about why it doesn t work and what we re gonna do to change it what you re gonna do to change it okay timers get your people ready remember you re gonna say ready set as soon as that go all right go ready set go oh you re supposed to get it right here this great piling direction did y all s work yeah good good did you record the time look tell him you guys are ready to keep going five trials good job and we ll discuss why yours worked in a minute we gonna take okay hang on tell me what happened when it got here it stopped it stopped why did friction okay the probably because the speed wasn t great enough okay so you think you needed more speed no i think we need to take this off okay let s try taking that off where do you think you can put those to get more speed up here ok now what is that gonna give the marbles more momentum yes let s make it bigger three centimeters is this our second one are we gonna do a second try you re going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works so reset it okay try again did it work yeah let s discuss why did it work this time look how we gave them these by doing what by um making it higher elevation ooh and what s another word that altitude yeah that s good okay so it worked how long did it take seven seconds face the recorder got it okay very good keep going you re ready for your second trial okay we re done y all already done five trials okay well let s just stop for a minute what comes down let s pull together here let s talk i want you guys to talk about why you think it worked because the big hill helped the hill what force is that the hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum good job so gravity pulled it down what did you say i said the hill s bigger than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go to make it through the loop right and the force pulling it down was what gravity gravity good now talk to me about the order that you put it in why would you you kind of just did we put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop to get more speed behind it good and the turn would make it slow down yeah so what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end friction friction okay very good we got all five trials you guys need a knee start recording your information it went really fast really fast just three seconds did it work on the first trial no okay tell me what happened on the first trial it was like that and it just went off right here okay why do you think it fell off what was going on right here to make it fall twist there was a twist in it so you just had to fix it so that it went straighter and so you pushed it renny put it like this like around here pushed it in so it might have been a little to steep too that incline might have been too steep what order did you put your elements in hill loop and turn okay and why d you put the hill first because it s higher and it would give more speed what force is giving it more speed right here gravity very good okay and then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn why didn t you put your turn there if we turn there s not enough speed for the loop okay y all both said the exact same thing repeat that to me so i understand if we put the turn first it won t have enough speed for the loop good very good all right good job guys have you got five trials it s all three seconds all of em were the same that s interesting very good we ll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information anthony what was your job record so you were the one that found that they were the same each time make sure you get written down everything okay guys talk to me we got three did the first one work no tell me what happened on the first one becuase i didn t see it the first one we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down right here when the chair was right there it kept on falling off so it just dropped so you think the incline was too what straight it was too steep there you go that s the word i m looking for it was too steep because it was right here and it was going all down very good so what did you do to fix it we kept on sliding it down a little did you have to slide it down more than once yes good job guys so did you get it to where you could do five trials yes and we got three for each three seconds they did too they got the exact same for all of em how about that but look at your coasters they look different yeah that s interesting too cause their incline is steeper than yours lets talk about the order that you have your elements in what s first the hill because it gives more speed when it s going down a hill so you don t but that s on what force gravity good job and why d you put your loop right after that because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it because if we did the turn it wouldn t have enough speed to make the loop good job good job need a knee record your information and start figuring your speed have you guys got all five trials nope uh oh what happened it stopped because of the friction when it get right here it started getting out of friction friction right here what s causing friction right here can i watch it its gonna work this time because we taped it down why do you think it s gonna work because we taped it down you know what i want you to use that one how long did that take seven seven seconds all right do it again let s look at it again so it was stopping right here it always was stopping right there and then i taped it down oh you taped this down that thing could be higher okay i think you should try that we can use this clock no we need some more i was gonna get one of them books guys you can use any state so what are you doing to the hills making it bigger so the speed will go more faster more faster so that it ll increase the speed all right let s see what happens let s see if this one works angel what are you doing timing ready one oh we use good team work you are using good teamwork i m proud of it ready set go it didn t start from the beginning i did not start that one let me ask you this just to give you a different idea because you ve already tried to change in the elevation of your hill maybe how big the loop is how do you think that ll help so the will go faster and will make it go through all right we re gonna try this help her out guys so we re making the loop smaller and that s gonna so now you might want to move this up a little bit there you see how this is gonna have to go there you go what about your taping if it s will the yeah let s try again wait we were gonna time that honey now you re ready to go so what was the solution to your problem to make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster all right good job now you re ready to time five trials ready go look how beautiful good job guys how many seconds four four seconds that s good how many trials three we got two more i want to know you got three seconds on each one so your speed was the same where did your distance come from we did how many feet and then we found out how many inches and times it by 18 because it s 18 on there how long was each tube six feet six feet how many inches is that let s work it out make sure you ve got it right on here 72 so you ve got 72 inches we only did one tube and how many tubes are there there s three tubes so 72 what would you do next times three yes 72 times three how did you guys get 216 you did 18 inches instead of six i mean 12 okay so now you ll have to go back and redo your speed figure in your speed so how do you find speed i still got 216 well then you were right that s right so you guys are ready to go on to make a graph let s talk about the graph you re gonna make let s talk about the graph thinking about what you ve learned in math and what you ve been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here what is this right here time i want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs i want you to decide what kind of graph you should make line graph because it s over time yeah line graph i decided yeah we decided to put a line graph because it s time so any time you use time the line graph is the one to use very very good do we write the numbers on here yeah how are you gonna know what numbers to put on there think about it you ve got the trials the distance the time and the speed do you need to use these you re probably just gonna use your trial and your speed so you ll label your line graph one will be the trial and one will be the speed and do you remember when you did the race car activity not the race car activity i m sorry remember the stanley the sluggish snail what did that line graph look like it was a straight line because it was a constant speed so what do you think this is gonna look like constant speed a straight line good okay you ve got your trial you got your times let s talk about your speed first we need to look at your distance how did you figure distance we need to divide by those speeds but your distance is how far the marble traveled right 18 yeah 18 yeah because you said each was six feet six feet you re doing it in inches oh so let s go back and refigure that i want you guys to talk about how to do that cause we want it in inches so what is the first thing you would do y all talk through it y all talk to each other let s talk about it after you re done erasing i was thinking like how many inches each okay there you go talk about it anybody know how many inches are in a foot 16 nope try again if you have a ruler 12 yep good so that s 12 x 3 good 36 okay so 36 inches and then how many of these are there three uh huh 36 multiplied six speed so you need to do 6 x 12 6 x 12 is 72 make sure you got it right i did it before it is 72 so now you will do 72 times three good do it on your paper it s 216 inches okay now what are you gonna do write it down and then what multiply 216 to this so how will you figure speed now divide divide what three to 216 very good can you tell me that again jeffrey you re gonna do what divide 216 into three and you ll only have to do it how many times one because you got the same speed each time you can do three into 216 72 and no remainder that s nice isn t it now knowing what we know about graphs what we re doing in math jeffrey are you listening y all stop writing for a minute and listen knowing what we know about graphs what we talked about in math and using this data and speed what kind of graph do you think you re gonna make line why did you say a line graph because it s the same i want you to think about this right here over time we discussed we need to use a line graph okay when you make your line graph which two columns there s only two columns that you can use on there which two do you think you re gonna use this one and well you ve already figured that out this one and which other one and speed good right because you were figuring all this for speed what do you think your line s gonna look like straight straight because it was the same every time good,0.0

you win good job give me five give me five give shanidra five good job guys,0.0
i can go into group two because that except this one is like these two are like both like pop these two are kinda like both pop because water s not bubbly this one s bubbly and this one s coca cola or dr pepper do you have a secret rule to use we re gonna get like one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles because they re kinda the same okay and this one like so i m gonna make sure i m understanding what your rule is gonna be does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container it s the bubble bubbles and stick to the side yeah okay so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side is that right yeah okay great alright alright friends in order to be closer together to really see how this is going to work i m going to ask anagelia s group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here go ahead and bring your liquids with you thank you very much and what we re going to do is we re going to set up our rule so that it s up here at the front so actually anagelia if you don t mind callie and natalie if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then anagelia s going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here okay thank you so we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table for your what s my rule okay so you re thinking of your property and you re going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don t fit the property here who would like to go first who would like to start okay so ryan s group ryan s group come up and set up one that fits your rule just a minute ryan isabella needs to come with you one that fits your rule here and one that doesn t fit your rule here just one just one one in each okay thank you you can be seated okay so we have this one fits their rule this one doesn t fit their rule i can tell bryson s already thinking about what it could possibly be this one can fit their rule hold on one second that s where we re going but wait one second okay let s talk about what we see any ideas so far of what might be going on here bryson do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space the bubbles on the top okay so you think it has something to do with bubbles do you have one that fits bubbles that one he s got a hypothesis now lena he s got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be do you think this fits the rule yeah okay so now we need to check in with isabella and ryan does that fit the rule yes it does okay it doesn t fit my rule so your rule should be the same as your partner s do you remember what that rule was ryan yeah okay great alright so anagelia thanks for raising your hand do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn t fit the rule thank you callie callie will you check in with isabella and ryan and see if that fits isabella does that fit the rule yes okay anybody else who s ready to bring one up oh another rule another one that might fit or doesn t fit rigo would you like to try which one do you think would go with this group which ones from the ones you have would go with this group bryson giving you a hint no that one doesn t that one here so you think both of these fit the blue one just the blue one because look at this one it doesn t leave white bubbles okay so if that one doesn t fit the rule where would it go rigo where would this one go this one over here right just hold that thought for a just a second no this one we said does fit it right isabella and ryan are we on track so far yes okay anagelia did your group have another one to bring up okay that one you think fits in this side fits the rule and callie you think this one doesn t fit the rule look when it shakes doesn t do anything okay okay natalina do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us what s going on here i think it s the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group when you shake it it has lots of bubbles that one doesn t okay so let s go back a minute though because you said two different things sit on your botton rigo first you said bubbles and not bubbles and then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it is that the same rule or is that different is the shaking part important do you think to that rule okay so can you state it one more time for us when you shake it if there s bubbles it will go that one if it doesn t go bubbles it goes in that one okay and isabella and ryan is that correct yup excellent so the shaking was the really important part of that great at least for this one it s weird right because right now this one has no bubbles but if i shake it it gets bubbles later okay excellent can you remember which ones you had in your group yes can you come and get them i m not sure if i can i m glad you can remember can you remember rigo which one you put out there this no that one s ours no this is ours um yeah one two three four five i think you ve got five these ones are originally from isabella and ryan i think yeah isabella and ryan can you come back and get yours great alright which partnership is ready to tell to not tell but to do another secret rule i thought i brought a blue did you think you brought a blue one you figured it out okay natalina s group can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule natalina you want to check that one more time make sure that s correct okay this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier and let s leave this on the table anagelia can you remind what the rule is stick to the sides anagelia can you remind callie what the rule is too go remind callie so these two do fit right alright show us one that doesn t please okay careful with the liquids please you okay alright we actually got a little extra help here now didn t we we got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not isabella do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn t fit the rule ryan can you sit on your bottom again please watch what isabella is doing oh cool see if you agree ryan watch what isabella s doing and see if you agree okay i agree natalina callie and anagelia thumbs up is that correct did she put it in the right place yeah okay good bryson and rigo do you guys have one that you want to put in yeah more than one more than one okay oh three oh go ahead if you think that s right i think that s right rigo rigo can you tell us why you put these two here because it can bubble bubbles in it because they have bubbles in them does this does not just a second just a second callie does this one have bubbles in it yes it does so it s not bubbles and no bubbles you re on the right track though take a look again ryan do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here stuff on the side and this one it goes away after awhile maybe this is the rule thank you ryan so far so good yeah okay yeah let s bring up all the rest oh bryson you can go ahead and leave those there you can go ahead and leave those there i think we re okay actually if you have any other liquids to bring up this one bring them on up and put them where they belong and we ll see if we can figure out what the rule is bring it on up bring it on up ryan bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes this one s confusing ooh a confusing one i love a confusing one do you know why because it helps you think it helps you think exactly it makes it more difficult to figure out would you like to consult with someone do you want to consult with ryan ryan come here a minute your partner needs your help she s trying to figure out where this one goes what do you think i think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one now remember we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule because look this one has bubbles this one if i shake it has bubbles so bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule okay thanks for your help ryan anybody else give isabella some assistance here well you know the rules already right anagelia what do you think anagelia which one do you think it goes in listen to anagelia rigo what s your opinion what do you think does it go in this group or this one what do you think even though you know what the rule is can you help her figure out how to classify it rigo are you watching what do you think it goes in in that one that one in this group right here okay what do you think isabella you want bryson s idea what does bryson think i think it goes in that one because because most of them kind of move when you shake them but when you shake those they don t oh interesting let s try that out okay okay ryan come a little closer to me right now please we re trying out something different bryson just said the ones rigo you can stay where you are you re right close by no bryson just said something really interesting he just said stand on your own two feet please thank you he just said that these ones don t move when you shake them and these ones do move when you shake them and that s how they re classified so i want to just double check that i make sure that i agree with what you re saying okay bryson does this one move when i shake it not really i can t really try it out okay see what you think it kinda does does this one move when you shake it yes yes okay oh it sticks on the walls ah ha so are you amending your rule are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides yes so this group right here is ding ding ding ding ding ding this group right here is the one s that stick on the sides yes ding ding ding ding ding ring the bell ring the bell but we still haven t figured out even if we know that that s what the secret rule is where does this one go that one that one that one okay natalina let s take your opinion first rigo we re listening to natalina and then we ll hear from you okay go ahead natalina i don t think it follows our rule it does you think it s totally out here it s separate it s not in either category no i don t think it goes in this one you don t think it goes in this one no i do think it goes because because it doesn t really stick to the walls it doesn t really stick to the walls okay you wanna hold it make sure stick to the other opinions other opinions anagelia i couldn t hear you could you say it louder so the group can hear you go ahead it should go there because when you move it some parts stick to the wall and some parts when you move it it sticks to the part it does stick to the walls yeah okay it s dirty isabella what do you think i think it should go in this one because it kind of it sticks to the wall at first and then it goes down so and then doesn t stick to the wall okay it sticks to the wall first and then it doesn t so you think it goes in this one may i have it just for a minute one thing i m noticing that s a little confusing for me if i look at this one compared to all the others this is the only one that s not colored in this group does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they re colored somehow so this one s not as sticky because it s less colored maybe i don t know so you re saying it sticks at first but then not so much after that can we tell how much this one sticks no yeah yeah it really sticks it really sticks how about this one can you tell how much this one sticks yeah it kinda sticks that does stick most of it some of it that does so it sticks but it is most of it goes away and some stays some goes away and some stays,0.0
negative x minus it it s one over oh wait oh wait wait wait wait how do we solve for x x is the value of r anyway x is the value of r what would you do for the one over x wouldn t that be the first term x is the value of r what i would suggest you do is is that you could rewrite this as an expression oh as the power oh oh okay okay i used oh yeah yeah all right yeah i got it so it s gonna be negative x minus one okay okay no i got it so the first it s gonna be so what whatever oh come on i just wanted to find where it talks about it would be one minus one oh we have one is one over x the sum do you see see what i m saying yeah i m gonna put it in there so negative x minus one cause later it s gonna change wait you don t really have to do it out since it s gonna change the so it s higher you ll have to you gotta yeah no no no no no don t don t don t don t don t even do that do you know why because it s part of a well yeah yeah yeah cause the whole thing is negative and then that s the remember the he s a natural but now here s the question you guys kind of already answered this question could you have found it they give you basically r is two x uh huh and since it converges it has to be less than the absolute value of you got it okay that makes sense go back for a second yeah you multiply both sides by a third so it d be one third times every single one of em and the interval um oh maybe someone s it means it s gonna get shifted and then you were just scaling the because it s like i d never i never considered oh okay yeah it s not gonna change the domain of the oh no no i m putting plus negative the answer yeah so the only thing i m thinking is it might be easier for you to just it might make sense somehow oh how do you read yeah how do you no no no no no no no no it doesn t reduce the time it takes for it to no man right oh okay yeah one third oh i get it i get it it only converges as you no matter what well no matter what one over x three x five x two in two over x i think it does thank you you re welcome that s what i m yeah that s what i m saying one over x because what they want you to do now so you d say power series is gonna be written as a form of say geometric series because now you ve got what what s the first term yeah right okay what s the ratio negative and when you write that out put around it let him once show him okay is it saying three x i would be i would take the are you sure you re working together yes and i ll turn it one we got one minus x squared one over one plus x squared that s x to the fourth right minus x to the sixth plus x to the eighth this is if you are indexing this this is your first term this is your second term this is your third term right think about the first one okay we have left that in order to get that a two x like the first r okay the first side of it and say it s the second term that the first time so it s probably gonna probably gonna be it probably okay at least on these simple ones okay okay leave that for okay n minus one over one minus one x minus one would be zero which would be originally we have negative one x minus one the right one so it s either gonna be now you re expanding by three instead of zero six so it s like negative x squared switched so the negative that goes over here is negative x squared too so the negative is which y i don t uh i don t know what i m doing all right look hold on isn t it the same as the third one that means that the y like the same one y is the common one right to the one so this would be x minus one and negative just put in one here four all right what s the ratio here one you re multiplying the outside of two x another one you re doing it as the two x that means you re moving the x to the inside if you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple if you take arcsine of x any function you want and you multiply it by scale like one third one fourth ah but then there we said no oh my god what arc what are you wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on there s gonna be another one i haven t there and one third after that is what we re doing here our r remains the same it s the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third okay yeah i m agreeing to that i m pretty sure that s right you multiply this out it s gonna be one over three plus three x minus one why are you multiplying it out just think of it as a scale it s not anything to do it s not gonna affect our domain outside the function it s only gonna affect the range and therefore you re not gonna have any remains cause the remains only matter if you didn t have but like one third of it so we re not doing it like that one third after it we re doing like a stretched version so it s not gonna affect the equation so it s negative x what no no no no no no that s the series for uh all right i m just negative x squared right no no no i m putting negative x squared it s easier cause then later on when you do plus no no no no no i the sine s been switching no no yeah but you can represent that by saying yeah it s gonna be smaller well it ll be switching but like would you represent how would you represent x in the whole thing to the negative see the n minus one is put that s how i m doing it wait how would you find the if it s the absolute value of x minus one it would be less than one mrs dockin yes is this is this is this x we re not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change what is x over r take this series right here which is that so then integrate it we just though you integrate every term to get it now you re looking for a general expression right you have a general expression it didn t tell you to come up with no they didn t tell you to do that oh okay okay okay because in fact that s not a power series that s not a power series it is okay but it s a different form of a power series so you don t have to write em like this because you would also need to have what you also have to have right yeah okay got it okay you flip it around one good yeah good what s r the negative of yeah you re the negative x plus one but it needs to be in parentheses so now you need your r okay now you re gonna do them when you get to it needs to be a form of k over r oh i thought we just solve for r you said the third nominated was r all right guys she said 1 3 times one whatever that is how do you multiply these does it need to be on the yeah so you do it again yeah multiply the whole interval yeah multiply the interval and this is not in the form of a series that one third does that impact the greatness of one that s the question you want to answer i m not answering it for you right now you need to figure it out so when it s asking for does the function of the this it s like that you didn t divide it by seven,0.0
so does percent always have to be 100 no because i see none of the percents up here are 100 they re all lower than 100 so you think a percent can either be 100 or less yes okay okay so that means you think this can be called an improper okay ian three fourths and the decimal 0 75 are the same what do you mean by the same one s a decimal one s a fraction well i mean like they re equivalent ah equivalent so does that go back to what alana said alana which ones did you have there one half and 5 so you re saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with one half and 5 10 yeah okay alana no well i did one fourth three fourths 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters ah you did one fourth what was the other one one wait one fourth three fourths all right 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters ah okay quarters i can think of money quarters or yeah 25 cents 75 cents yeah 25 cents is one quarter 75 cents is three quarters three quarters one quarter excellent good good ian everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal oooh so you found a way to connect every single one of them so everything can be made into say it again a percent fraction or decimal interesting so you re saying that i can take this percent and write it as a just a percent or as a what else fraction and decimal so okay he s connecting all he thinks all three of them can become equivalent from the views before excellent ian six fourth one fourth and three fourth they all have a denominator of four ah yeah what does that mean that they all have a denominator of four well they re all like sets of fourths what does a denominator represent in a fraction the um bottom number when we write it as the bottom number when we re literally writing it what does it actually represent what s that for how many equal parts it s split into ah the number of equal parts it s split into so let me go back to ian ian is saying that everything can be written as also as a fraction a decimal and a percent so can everything be in four parts what if it s in five parts does that matter i can do the five parts as a percent or i can do four parts as a percent yeah what about what alan said percent is it up to a hundred and that s it no depends on the range that you set it so can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100 well like when something you did in earth science we did to see if our grow dino grew over 600 good connection okay so what did that mean if it grew over 600 it like grew bigger than times over six hundred times its size yeah 600 times its size okay so is it possible so is that an improper percent no but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100 meybe we can t go over 100 what happened here you tell me about that percent it s less than one percent is that possible can you think of a real life example when you d have less than one percent about growing something expanding over and over to 600 times its size can you give a real life example of when i would have 0 when you fail a test oh well i could fail a test with 64 what does it mean if i fail a test with 0 other than i m in big trouble at home what does it mean what would that mean if you failed it with 0 what would that mean about what you did on the test you didn t get anything right yeah you got zero right nothing right didn t get a single question right can it be less than zero is this less than zero yeah no it s less than one so where is zero here tenths is that zeros no where s zeros between where would they go would they go in the ones place tens place ones in the ones place we have zero ones so is this less than zero yes no no no because it s 0 1 interesting okay so can i have less than zero percent no you can have a negative but if it s negative percent can you have a negative percent what do you think well i was going to say something could be like one point like point one percent less than something if you re comparing two things okay your percent of increase or decrease have you looked at that in earth science yet standard deviation okay we ll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase decrease i m talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent and whether that s below one or zero okay so can you give an example of where this could occur where i can have less than 1 it can occur i think with that fraction okay but that s just a made up can you give me something in real life that i could have less than 1 you can have an example of more than 100 so my question is does percent go from 100 to one or zero or is there anything less in between what do you think like a gas tank in your backyard okay like when you call in to get it filled and it s really low the meter s low and under one okay that s typically not going to be measured in percent it s going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank it s going to be a volume situation oh okay but we ll talk about that so let s keep that in mind we re still trying to find an example when we have less than 1 think of one alice like on the labels and stuff on the vitamins less than 1 of your recommended day or something i just so happen to have here vitamins you re right and there are some examples when if i take this i m not going to get my daily 1 i m going to get less than that but there s some of these in here ooh like if i take one of these i get 100 of vitamin c now i drank a glass of orange juice this morning when i took my vitamin what happened to the percent of vitamin c where s it at it went over 100 over 100 so there s a real life when i can get over 100 of something anybody get over 100 on a quiz or test ever over and how do you get that bonus ah bonus questions so we re good with coming up with more than 100 but we re still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it s less than one percent so we ll go back to that any other connections let s see if we can connect the ones we haven t done yet anything with the leftover ones one fifth and 20 are equal okay box right there they re equivalent to each other right how did you know they were equivalent because one fifth of 100 is 20 okay she did one fifth of 100 because we think of again we keep going back to a hundred for 100 is 20 out of 100 excellent what else one tenth and 10 ah what can you say about one tenth and 10 they re equivalent again equivalent going to go back to ian ian they re finding the percent and the decimal but there s no fraction there fraction with a percent but there s no decimal is there a third for all of them you said there s an equivalent fraction decimal percent for all of them no but there can be the decimal would be so what would you like to add here ian let s go to the which one you pick one find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we re missing well 150 and six fourths is equal okay do we think they equal each other no yeah yeah convincing but not yet you haven t convinced everybody do you think that equals okay four fourths would equal 100 and one fourth each fourth is 25 and if it s two over then i ve got two fourths left over and that d be 50 and they can also equal 0 5 so now we need the decimal piece 1 5 what did you say alan uh two fourths can equal 0 5 so what do you think six fourths give me the decimal that i ll put here we agree that these are equal 1 5 oh so there is a decimal that goes there how d you get 1 5 oh because one and a half got it see where the half came from you said ruby you had told us that one half and five tenths were equal so if we have that one half here we do the same thing we combine it here to get the 50 okay so any others what s the missing piece ian uh you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like another well pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece one in one thousands one thousandths one thousandths and 0 1 ah are these equivalent no yes no you re going to have to convince them ian it s the day of ian convincing i don t know they are why do you say they are because one percent over a hundred well because that s tenth that s not thousandths it s not one tenth it s one tenth of a percent so here s another question then are those equivalent no no so be careful that s not one tenth that s one tenth of a percent so could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one thousandths yes yeah but when you divide it by 100 ah so we keep hearing divide and multiply by a hundred so when i convert from a percent to a decimal or percent to a fraction i m using powers of what ten ten so the question is is that the equivalent to that yeah how do you want to do it ava um can you fill in the missing piece can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here with a missing decimal that i have i have the percent and i have the fraction but we think we re going to get all three of them can you tell me what decimal that is um zero and one thousandth how did you get that um divide by 100 ah dividing by 100 what do you notice happens when we divide by 100 it goes back okay when we divide it it moves two decimal places and the decimal place moves two places over so did that happen so are we convinced that these three are now equal yes can we see that now but you divide 0 1 you divide it by a hundred to get oh yes you re changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that okay yeah now that ava gave us the decimal is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other yes because now you when you read that you read it as what one and one one thousandths so are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction decimal percent for every fraction every decimal and every percent yes so why do we have all three why not do everything in fractions do everything in percents or do everything in decimals why do we have in real life all three things going on alice because for some things it s easier to picture it in percent in decimal okay so picturing a visual to go with it can you think of an example of one we use or in real life well like with money it s like easier to think that it s going to be 25 cents or 0 25 than like 25 of a dollar yeah wouldn t that be interesting if they said how much is that salad today well it s something percent of a dollar okay ian well with fractions one third is equal to 0 333 and keep going ah so if we did with fractions or decimals we might have some repeating,0.0
please freeze for a moment gentlemen what did you think about your performance i wouldn t say terrible but were you accurately on pitch all of you no no like as soon as the ladies came in you were like whoo and then you forgot what you were singing okay so don t let them distract you they re trying they re trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off but hold firm men hold firm to your position all right let s try it again here we go sing noel sing noel noel noel lock it in sing noel sing noel noel noel two parts sing noel sing noel noel noel sing noel sing noel noel noel together sing we all noel the support sing we all noel two parts sing we all noel sing we all noel back to the beginning sing noel sing noel noel noel end song all right if you were going to give yourself a grade what would you give it alison as a class like out of a s and b s and c s yep i would give an a minus okay and why the minus what do you think we think need to improve the pitch was kind of off at some parts okay so there was maybe some pitch issues what about energy level it was okay but this but one of the things about african music is it is something that is like felt in their soul okay it is traditionally when you listen i mean they are just letting it you know when we see any of the performances or listen to any of the cds we ve listened to it s just very gut felt i feel like you re sing noel sing noel noel noel so this is so pretty yes we want sing noel sing noel noel noel especially on that sing we all noel that s me we re singing it s like you re telling people we are singing not sing i think we all noel okay so let s make sure that we re right there on that one more time see if you can get a little more weight to your sound i don t mean make it flat i just mean with more confidence more security more support okay here we go sing noel sing noel noel noel awesome sing noel sing noel noel noel two part sing noel sing noel noel noel sing noel sing noel noel noel support this sing we all noel sing we all noel sing we all noel sing we all noel sing noel sing noel noel noel good and stop there so you get the idea that was awesome did you hear the difference yeah awesome i love that you challenged yourselves you pushed yourselves there it s hot those notes are kind of high i know that and you just pushed right through it so good job let s review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time so i m going to come here so we can do our body percussion real quick we are going to start with our bass part ladies and gentlemen we are not going to use these right now because traditional african music is by rote meaning you learn it by hearing you learn it by doing if you are a visual learner these are our music stands by the instruments so this will help you and you know i want everyone to be successful so you use the tools that will help you be successful you be an independent learner where you decide if this is what you need grab a music stand okay if you don t you don t need it okay so there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick okay so basses first let s all kind of scoot over this way so bass section first we have starting with your left hand sing oh sing oh sing noel sing oh sing oh sing noel and you have that crossover sing oh sing oh sing noel everybody feel comfortable with that any questions you look good you look like you have it all right then we have the xylophones this one s a tricky one so we have for that part let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time so we have sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it sing noel sing noel let s simply celebrate it okay so the trickiest part is how many g s all right so remember we have low c and high c so you have c c c c c c and there s four gs over that syncopated rhythm g g g g f e d okay so it s kind of like one two three down the ladder you go okay so let s try that c c c c c c g g g g f e d c c c c c c g g g g f e d got it got the idea all right then we go on to the glockenspiels and for that one we can just clap that rhythm because i think on the instruments it will be easier to see to show because they re so obviously a little so it s not really like that so here we go it goes sing oh yes sing noel noel sing oh yes sing noel noel sing oh yes sing noel noel okay got the idea for that rhythm so i will come over and help that section and some of you may remember that from last time then we have our percussion section okay we have first the conga drum a real quick review on conga drum playing everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you if we can kind of spin back here so i can show you when you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit and scoot over that way there we go so when you play conga drum you actually are going to hold it in between your legs and put your feet around the base and you re going to tip it out from you so that that way the sound can come out but you also have the correct play style remember pat on the ends when you re playing and those are in you can pat this on your lap as well right now practice on your fingers okay so here s on this practice with a good technique right now ready go this is the part of the conga drum all right you ve got the idea and that goes over and over each measure then we have the log drum and the log drum and again the parts are right here on the stand if you need them you re going to have one side you re going to play sing so basically and it doesn t matter with those sing noel sing noel sing noel okay so you can clap that real quick sing noel sing noel sing noel sing okay see how it fits hello welcome thank you very much all right so next we are going to have this part which is traditional african bell and this one you have rest rest rest noel sorry hi to low so it s rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel rest can you snap it noel rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel and you can try it rest rest rest hi and fast noel rest get them up noel rest rest rest noel yes ladies and gentleman i m always spot checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we re doing this it s really important that i see that participation because then when we go to pick parts i m looking to see who has it yes there s choice but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing okay so let s try it again ready go rest rest rest rest rest rest rest rest rest noel rest rest rest noel you got it and then i love these shakers you are the pulse you are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song so it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together so again really important we might add in some other more african instruments they re kind of loud so we ll see if you can get the correct sound so what i d like you to do now do you have any question all right if you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time i would challenge you to maybe pick a different one okay if you were still working on it you re welcome to stay there but without any payoffs so just kind of selection i would like you all to go and pick an instrument part remember we have glockenspiels basses xylophones and percussion so open two glockenspiels open and a bunch of xylophones open who was there first who was there first between you and ellen i was here you were there okay so if you want to join the glockenspiels you can do that you can go to xylophones oh nobody s up to the challenge all right once you get there you can start practicing all right hold up everybody all right thank you since we re trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually if you have the green mallets would you especially for you guys switch them out with the felt mallets instead so here s a set well you need those for that as well so we have one there should be another one in there oh here right here nope those are green you don t want those oh here s another one right here here here you go here s a set that s awesome thank you because that s just going to make it a lot softer and not quite as angry sounding all right so let s listen to each part so you can know what you re listening for remember when you are playing in an ensemble like this if you can t hear the other parts what does that tell you you re playing too loud yes you re playing too loud and remember again texture is everything we want to be able to pull out the different parts so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that but for right now let s make sure that we can keep it soft okay it s not a competition all right no one s going to win it s the whole class that we re trying to do this together so if we hear bass part first and let s go ahead and add at least shaker for right now and then we ll build in one or two sections one two ready go okay time out so you re listening for the beat she s watching me instead of the basses right because you re doing their work a little bit and you need to keep it nice and steady what happened we ended up with three different tempos did you hear that one two ready go okay pretty good and then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are okay one thing that will help is adding the singing to it okay,0.0
from the top this way starting from the top woo hoo that went better can we have a ruler yeah 75 okay make sure you record it 75 what 75 cm c m what s c m stand for centimeters centimeters okay now we ve got to get the average i m gonna do the average go ahead go to your next one i m gonna check on the next group okay no you don t put 75 for all of them i m not just on that one we knew it wouldn t go any farther just put 75 for the first one second part trial two now what do we do okay go ahead tell me what you found out what did you discover about bubble wrap sand paper wax paper and just the plain ramp on the bubble wrap it didn t go because it was a bumpy surface because all the bumps because it was too bumpy and had to much friction too much friction okay and so what did you discover sean i discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower what do you mean by that higher and lower and higher can you explain that a different way to me well so what does that say about the surface increase and decrease spencer what did you discover so so it went farther on plain wrap versus the wax paper yeah okay so right now you re going to find the average right how are you gonna find the average like 32 plus plus 30 plus 41 divided by three okay you guys go ahead and do that who s going to be the calculator i am you are okay i might suggest someone else also be the calculator so you can compare your numbers and then i m gonna come back and talk to you about your results okay okay let s sit down let s see what your doing it s not going very good on the sand paper because it s just like the carpet why won t it go as far on sandpaper because it s like the carpet okay what does that tell you about friction that if it s sand paper it doesn t have a lot of contact it rubs against the rug it rubs against the tires i think it doesn t one person at a time paul because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn t have a lot of friction if it did have a lot of friction it would go faster okay so does sand paper have friction or not yes or no no no yes what is friction one person at a time it s like whoosh that s friction hm okay can you explain what is your idea stephen friction when a car rolls on carpet it s friction because it slows it down sand paper slows it down too so far what have you discovered about friction and wax paper versus sand paper wax paper let s let stephen tell me okay wax paper is kinda like it s probably gonna be like the look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far because you already recorded them it s the highest so far what does that mean it s the highest so far it s the one that has the least amount of friction it has the least amount of friction okay and how do you know that because we did the experiment and what happened it didn t go as far it didn t go as far on what okay go ahead an finish your experiment go ahead and finish on the plain ramp you have one more to do i see here okay and then we ll talk about what we should do next oh 39 that s showing you more about fourth dimension let s talk about our results talk about your results that you ve noticed sh stephen tanner i need to be able to hear this group okay we found now that our total averaged out to 85cm for our total average okay what does this tell you look at your averages what does this tell you about friction that friction slows you down like the salt slows you down on ice like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice it makes you go faster right and you know what it s doing outside right now what is it doing outside right now it s sleeting it s sleeting it s snowing and the roads are very very slick so what do you think s gonna be a great idea because i know my husband s coming home from work tonight the roads are gonna be slippery what s gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer what should the road crews do salt they can put salt and salt and sand salt and sand yes why so it didn t go at all i wonder if it was small little bubble wrap if it would work better what do you think i think if they were popped oh if they were popped i wonder if they would maybe so okay down here you have a graph that we re gonna talk about a little bit later but this is what i want you to do i want you to pretend like you re a teacher and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did what would you tell them i want you to write it on the back of here what s one thing that you ve learned today that you would teach someone and then we re gonna talk about it okay i want you to talk about it when you re done writing talk about it with each other and i ll be back in a minute okay we can share when we re done writing or we can share them as we write them so what would we tell someone i would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower what would you say i would say the rougher the surface the more friction i would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying except a little bit different i would say it depends on which kind of surface it is if it s bumpy it won t go if there s bumps and air all over on it if it s a smooth and soft surface it will probably go a lot faster so tell me what you are you still writing we all shared it okay but i want to see it in writing like i want to see something written down i said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes okay spencer what are you gonna write because i m gonna write kind of the same thing as heather is there anything your gonna change about it or add to it i m gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less and the less further it goes okay i like that i think you guys are learning a lot about this sean i see your writing something a little bit different what are you writing i m writing the smoother the surface the farther the car goes you guys are right the farther it goes because why because the friction because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go but on a smoother surface barely any what what word is she looking for she said on a smoother surface there s barely any friction and i like what you said you said a smooth surface is like ice a smooth surface is like ice right i said the bumpier the surface the more friction right but you also said something that if it was a smooth surface it s kinda like ice there s no friction to keep it from like if it s outside today if it s ice your car could go anywhere but putting sand down or the salt keeps it less friction more it has more friction okay okay go ahead and finish what what do you want i wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice oh so how would be do that i like that how would we do it when it s like an icy day or something and there s a little bit of ice somewhere we could bring the car out or something not like a real car oh okay just like a play car and try it out try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice how could we change this experiment what could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out i think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap we talked about that popped bubble wrap and what else did you say the bubble wrap could be what talk about that the bubble wrap could be what guys i need you to not come in here you can use un popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile and you probably use like a grid with the marbles instead you can like use a car okay talk about that to see if it would fall off now what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off with force and motion how does that tie in well what i mean is will it like go far if you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not like if it was on the it depends how fast it would go if it went faster would it fall off but if we re talking about friction does this have anything to do with friction oh i love that so wood carpet and ice and we could freeze ice because we have big containers,0.0
gina i wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids example alka seltzer maalox and tums can effectively neutralize okay so far we ve been listening to this are we talking mostly the same equipment same supplies yeah right maybe some beakers maybe some pipettes and some base right okay is this similar to juan s this one is right so maybe we can start grouping these two together christina the goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective tide clorox or oxyclean by determining which is most basic any concerns yeah adrian how do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic maybe there s some other factors that go into that and they re it s just basic ness juan that some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors i mean some of them have safety warnings that say like don t get too close to the vapors that come out okay so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn t use them is that what you mean yeah okay okay we use them in our homes but don t bring them to school right yeah i m a little concerned too about your idea that it s about which one is most basic okay cause the active ingredient in clorox i think is bleach and bleach sodium hypochlorite is sodium hypochlorite which has a pretty interesting smell i d stay away from that and then we have tide right tide is not bleach all right i m not sure what the actual detergent active ingredient is but i m pretty sure it s not bleach so this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test and that it makes sense why we re testing it okay all right we ll come back to this and oxyclean is powered by billy mays so it doesn t matter it wins anyway i think he died didn t he yeah he did it s too bad you know that guy must have made so much money i better not complain adrian go ahead i will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory to do this i ll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker i ll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate after as much precipitate as possible has formed i ll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected any ideas jimmy i m kinda wondering why it s important to you like you said to make the lab meaningful yeah it should be so adrian do you have a response it s just cause bottles that don t have molarity kind of annoy me and i feel like i should there should be like a label that says the molarity i just kinda you know my room is open fifth period every day you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations i don t have a free fifth period after school s fine too that s cool that s cool what concerns me is i thought the theme was titration right is the theme titration okay where is the titration aspect to this do you know what i m asking here yeah i know i just didn t realize because you re mixing you re doing a precipitate reaction everybody see it that way i think you re doing a precipitate reaction and so i just feel like you know this you had the wrong theme going on here anyway we ll move on nicholas artel artel sirhan sirhan although he was a bad man though i think right he was accused of being a bad man go ahead the goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more vitamin c per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate crush them dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it i would also use a ph sensor to see what the solution to see when the solution is at seven to see when it s neutralized doing this will let me know which company i should buy from for my vitamin c pills what do you guys think vitamin c is ascorbic acid i don t know if you wrote that did you no okay so if it s an acid you can titrate it right is anybody concerned about like anything here jimmy don t the pills tell you how much vitamin c is in them like the bottle wait let me make sure if you buy a vitamin c that says 100 milligrams of vitamin c my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets and you crush it and you do this experiment it s gonna be close to that 100 milligrams so are you testing because you think they re not accurate yeah oh okay so you re testing for accuracy on their part just to keep them honest because i mean 100 milligrams it s kind of a non specific number all right ian actually another way you could look at it is that just because it says 100 milligrams that s how much of the vitamin c is in it that s not how big the tablet is being that sometime i mean you could have and say just arbitrary numbers you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin c or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin c so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it actually had more stuff in it per density okay but is that what you want him to do i thought are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100 you don t care how big this tablet is unless unless what s the danger here some of that other that tablet contains acids or bases in them then that would affect your results right one of them i have is pretty pure it s pretty much just ascorbic acid the other company i have does have some other stuff in it so i was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly vitamin c have you ever been to like the cvs and looked in the section i mean i could find one i just haven t there s a bunch you could even what d you guys figure out it s turning yellow why do you think it s doing that maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves gets out some co2 and turns it acidic i didn t think it would be that big of a deal because wait hang on so you mean so far what you ve done is you ve crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue yeah and that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want that s right that s what you re saying yeah what color should it be blue i guess it s kind of green it just looks as if this coloring is just green dye have you thought about using like phenolphthalein that has a distinctly pink color otherwise it s clear no we did not think of that you wanna try that yeah yeah that d be better so the phenolphthalein is gonna be it s probably going to be behind if it s pink it s acidic right no if it s basic do the bubbles matter all right could i just stop and ask you guys did you guys get your color change you were looking for yeah so the titration is working out yep very clean what so tell me what you got here this is a disinfecting clorox we re just starting out we re just trying to measure out 10 milliliters that one we re done with we got it to the brown like it didn t stir anymore that was it that s as far as it went we put in 61 and that was it now we re going to start this one and that worked with the one molar so is this oh so this is a different concentration or how is this one different this is just a different this is a different type and it s a different percentage of the hypochlorate that s disinfecting spray and that s bleach with a different type of clorox cleaning product all right did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous no we did not make sure but they re i just wanna you know we don t wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here when we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing and this was fine like it said it should be done in basic and everything okay god bless you excuse me how s everything going not good with this one what s in there it s red wine vinegar but it hasn t changed color the treatment s too powerful yeah we re thinking it s too so we re gonna do the white what s the solution to that then why don t you just use less less of the vinegar right all right so we use five milliliters instead of well i mean right if you use less then don t you think you ll be able to titrate it easier well you d need less base to get there right okay let s go over here see what happens over here so squeeze that out what are you guys so you ve got vitamin c crushed in there you used is this bromothymol blue what did you use yeah we used btb and now we re gonna see how much base we used just out of curiosity why did you use a graduat what is this about 50 you didn t want to use like cause that is are you gonna all the other ones were like dirty yeah they were kinda and i think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment s limit all right coming along okay it looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 hi you re adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue yeah is that too much well has it occurred to you and it probably hasn t it s okay bromothymol blue itself is either a weak my guess is it s a weak acid it could be a weak base but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases so we always want to use a bare minimum amount therefore how about if you use something that has a distinct color change roughly at the neutral point like phenolphthalein cause then it ll go from pink your this is acid these are acids so they ll go from clear to a pinkish color okay okay but do you think the pink will be able to be seen well like the blue one you know the blue you need to use a lot more to get there although i don t know i suppose since you already did this one i mean we could remeasure out you may wanna well we don t want to run out of time here so right stay consistent and then consider it how you can make improvements later okay all right now that s very nice you guys have questions what was your results in comparing what the company says and what you there was a little bit less since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure pure ascorbic acid as in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to which is it s pretty close and the other one was around than what you re probably paying for but but that s then again it could ve been because because not all the powder dissolved some of it was still settled on the bottom so they could be really accurate yeah they could be you know dead on for the trials did you guys use different amounts of stuff for the two trials for the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill and then for the third trial we used 100 right a hundred and then for those trials like the third one you said you used a different concentration of naoh yeah why did you use a different concentration first of all there wasn t much left of the 567 and also you know who s to you know maybe that could ve been contaminated it might not have been 567 so it s also good to use some different stuff sometimes right you can t always base it you can t have it all on one thing yeah that s smart how did yo actually figure out the amounts what was the math oh we did the stoichiometry yeah but we assumed that it was a one to one ratio one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one oh from the base and so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of vitamin c do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one h plus no we just assumed that for the experiment maybe you should look that up yeah yeah the other thing anybody else so the other thing is and i just wanna make sure when you said 500 milligrams that s 5 grams right we did it accurate with yeah cause that thing the scales here give you two sig figs right okay i mean to the hundredths hundredths of a gram right so you crush this thing and you weighed out 50 yeah that s what you did it how much was left in the i mean of one tablet when you you know what i mean when you crush it yeah how much we had excess i mean one of the pills i had was 1000 milligrams so we you know we had about we had a like about it is my fault for oh you were using 1000 milligram tablets and then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven like milligrams that s how we removed so we had to we removed mass oh well how bout this if it if they say 500 but the thing weighs six what d you say six or seven hundred oh yeah then aren t there other ingredients already in there not that were listed like yeah they weren t listed it just said it just said vitamin c because they might just list the active ingredient right yeah in other words if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim my guess would be there s more of something else okay because here s another thing don t you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the vitamin c in a clump do you see what i m saying yeah yeah and they ll typically use some there s gonna be some certain chemicals they re gonna use that s in there so i have a feeling before you write the company be careful they re yeah yeah they probably added other ingredients yeah because what i think might ve been even better is if they claim 500 then why don t you just crush the whole thing regardless of how much it weighs and then titrate that you see what i m saying yes cause then they re claiming there s the you see what i m saying so that would be taking further just simply yeah that would be the experiment wouldn t that be like the next yeah thing that you could try same thing with 1000 right i mean if they claim 1000 yeah go crush the whole thing and see what,0.0
welcome to our kindergarten classroom the library is the heart of our room where books are labeled and sorted by genre and reading level to facilitate student self selection this is also where we display author studies current student work and student made literacy charts this is where we have our writing center more level texts classroom volunteer supplies and a lending library math work is on display and student portfolios are organized and easily accessible we have a few tables to facilitate guided instruction and small group learning our schedule and calendar are housed in this part of the room and we have a message board which is portable and used for modeled and interactive reading and writing our learning center s chart organizes student movement around the classroom and our word wall houses high frequency words and rich tier 2 vocabulary words but on the morning of the fair the little calf was nowhere to be found she had wandered down to mud pond by the cornfield to cool off when she waded into the muddy water her feet sank with every step she sank deeper and deeper and deeper the little calf was stuck in mud pond get the hands get the helpers the farmer shouted when he saw her all the farm hands came running with their ropes but the more they tugged the more stuck the calf got get the big yellow tractor the farmer shouted he can save her but the big tractor just scared the little calf she sank deeper and deeper and nearby farmers began to gather around readers i think we ve come to our problem in the story i think the characters otis and the calf have a big problem talk to your partner and see if you can figure out what the problem is readers i heard a lot of good ideas i heard a lot of good discussion miami what s the problem who sank into the mud the baby cow it s called a calf oh my goodness readers i heard everybody s discussions you guys were all talking about the big problem the calf is stuck in the mud help me write that in the problem box here we go the calf is stuck in the mud that s our problem the calf is stuck in the mud let s see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story let s see how they re feeling now it tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions call fire chief douglas and the fire truck the farmer shouted they can save our little calf but the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper the farmer was fit to be tied if the farm hands and the big tractor and even fire chief douglas and his fire truck couldn t save the little calf who could oh my goodness look at everybody what effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community how is everybody feeling i like amir s raised hand how is everybody feeling amir they feel sad sad i heard you say another good word that started with w worried worried they re sad they re worried how else are they feeling sad worried scared scared scary what if they can t get her out scary call a lot of people yeah they re in panic mode they re trying to call everyone they re panicked frightened afraid afraid worried worried so so worried so so worried they might call the other tractor the big tractor can t get her out he already tried wait kanye were you talking about the other tractor the red one oh they might call otis maybe otis could help that might be a good solution to the problem let s see what they do let s find out suddenly the little calf s ears perked up over the hum of the growling crowd there came a faint sound in the distance a soft rhythmic purr put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck the crowd turned and looked you hear the word chuck who is coming otis otis good let s see what happens the sound became louder put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck let s all make otis sound put put puttity chuck put put put chuck put put puttity chuck all at once otis put puffed from around the barn he turned and he headed straight for mud pond otis put puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters edge the calf heard her friend s puttering purr and bawled it was almost like hello she s crying out to otis yeah she bawled to the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd otis slowly began to circle the pond he circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned never taking her eye off her friend it looks like they might be solving their problem with each ring otis made around mud pond the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own the two friends had found each other again it looks like we found a solution to our problem talk to your partner about how they found a solution how did they solve their problem i heard a lot of good discussion how did they solve their problem you guys i heard everybody talking about it so jabrielle how did they solve their problem what was the solution who came and got her out of the mud i heard you tell isaiah otis otis ramaya how did otis get her out of the mud just like jabrielle said he rided around the mud oh i don t know if you can hear ramaya she said otis rode around mud pond and got the calf out of the mud help me write that otis rode around mud pond it was called mud pond otis rode around mud pond and he got the calf out of the mud that s the solution now how is everybody feeling what effect is this having how do they feel now that they have their problem solved nijyah excited excited miami happy sherod glad glad edward yeah they re feeling great they re reunited their family is back together zion how do you feel when you solve your problem they are a little exhausted aren t they that was a lot of work ismail they re feeling okay they re feeling relieved relieved wow great job let s see how the story ends readers you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story it s really helping us comprehend the story better we re understanding it really well otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went following them into town it looked like a happy parade no one needed a fancy no one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf otis was a special tractor and the two of them were special friends from that day on the farmer discovered that with otis puttering purr beside the chicken coop his chickens laid more eggs at milking time with otis gentle chuck nearby his cow produced more milk and on occasion otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields but often at the end of the day otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved,0.0
scientist number two i want to know what your question is what is your variable that you re isolating and what are you measuring you guys ready okay so table two or table one our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes even after they ve been rinsed and our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used and the dependent variable is how they changed from before when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them cool and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain tomorrow we also were planning on taking pictures from before and after so we could like compare those so you may want to do a scale like marley did with the intensity of her hair dye as well okay but get it set up today make it really controlled with all your measurements and just change the type of oil alright scientists do you have any our experiment is we re going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges okay using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water i don t know i read your document i don t know what the positively charged particles you are but did you work it out okay so what s your question then our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum okay does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls them coming together scum balls okay good table three what s your question um how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water like using what we re going to use mainly olive oil and toilet paper okay perfect and testing the independent variable is testing how long we re going to stir how long it takes to make scum and then our dependent variable we re going to take the observations of time okay so the question is how long does it take to form scum balls independent variable is the stir time and the dependent variable is the how long it takes how long it takes to do it uh huh what are you going to measure though we re going to actually try to measure the surface area of the cool so you re going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time okay that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot okay table four what s your question how does temperature affect the oil and water how does temperature affect the oil and water awesome and we re trying to figure out how it will separate how can you separate it what are you changing in the experiment we re changing we re going to use regular temperature and put it on a bunsen burner and put it in the freezer cool and you re more than welcome to use the freezer in the back good idea alright table five what s your question does heat affect the scum ball does heat affect the scum ball and our independent s going to be amount of scum and the amount of water and the dependent s going to be heat okay so your independent now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever so your independent is really going to be temperature so i feel like you have two independent variables why don t you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate is it the amount of water and the amount of scum or is it temperature okay we were going to change the temperature then keep the amount of water and the scum constant because you can t do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures it means you re testing for two different things while you could do that it s two experiments and we don t have time today so just one experiment alright table six so our central question is is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes okay and our independent variable was the amount of oil and the dependent was the shape okay so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes independent variable is the amount of oil or scum dependent variable is the shapes while i m over here i just want to draw your attention to the back of the room that is the waste beaker which has scum on top of it right now it s every kind of oil that copper used yesterday so if you want pre made scum i encourage you to use copper s waste from yesterday so the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water but the top portion of it is just that less dense oily scum okay alright table seven what s your question it s can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter okay so we re trying two different types of oil and we re going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container okay and you may need to use two of the same identical filters so just make sure you re really consistent with your measurements between those two filters good alright i m excited about their project because copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting so check back in with this group later on if you want to see what s going on with the filters and table eight what s your central question does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water does oil collect the most what does oil collect the most of each thing oh the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water okay so you re going to look and see what it attracts and what are some of the materials you re going to use dirt sand and pebbles dirt sand and pebbles awesome so your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract how are you going to measure those results mass mass okay cool you may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass if you get too big it won t measure on our balances which brings me to my next topic which is safety talk conservation of materials did you guys get a lecture yet no because sam is too busy with her why don t you go over there and see what they re doing go talk to her thank you alright lady scientists what s going on we re like i thought that we didn t need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn t have enough time so we just did the small amount and then the larger amount okay now that we did the middle speed we re actually seeing a lot different stuff because the balls are actually coming together that underneath and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top okay and this is thicker than that one okay let me get another group over here because they re also trying to form a scum ball and i d like them to see your results terrence and catherine and maddy can you guys pause and come and check out this group s experiment i don t see scum it makes me mad ooh this is so cool why does it look like that i want it to look like that come on over these guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls can you guys talk about what s your independent variable what are you changing we re just changing the different speeds okay and yasmine what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three the dirt oil and the water okay and they used the black potting soil dirt is it the peat moss in the plastic bag that s peat moss okay good and taylor it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom what s that don t know can you guys fill her in toilet paper toilet paper which makes sense because there s a lot of toilet paper over there okay and so far your results have been they ve just done the high speed and the low speed right and they re like oh it s the same nothing happened nothing happened right they came back today and this is the medium speed and what s going on a lot of dirt balls are actually coming down and forming together because they were all little pieces of dirt and now they re making big globs of dirt and that s weird so does time sitting overnight have anything to do with it that s what we talked about with these two actually this one because and this one too because we didn t see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one and then this one i just noticed that it s actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil okay are the highs and the lows working the speeds yet have you tried to re run the highs and the lows today no re run the highs and lows you have a good seven six minutes see if they start to form clump balls not sure if you can use this one can i go get a funnel sure there s one on the table i am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not if you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything or you could leave it how it is it s your choice got about seven minutes okay thank you yes cool hey you guys have some diesel fuel on your table any information research observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome the three of you all together alright so we got 97 no 47 94 for all of them okay let me put the camera on you four ready let s talk about it is that okay okay so you isolated your variable different types of oil you made everything the same same size same amount of water same amount of soap time soaking everything was super controlled right okay and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board yeah it was 47 94 like it jumped between them two numbers constantly none of them like consistent so it was consistent alright so any initial conclusions yes i said that since all the things were like a darker color and the oils were kind of close i guess in like how they felt and what color they were i guess that maybe if we used a white shirt maybe there would ve been a difference because it would ve soiled it more do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric yes yes okay alright let me hear your conclusions and then i m going to this one that had water on it is different looking than this one like the material looks more like like dry or something right so there s some qualitative difference i know that this one needs to be flipped over because then it s the same side of the fabric okay so water that one s whiter lighter okay so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking and your control this one is darker your control was the same as all of them the 47 94 okay and you any conclusions yet um i don t know i kind of think the sand thing is sand because i know the one we put on the paper like it went all the way down to 40 something so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was okay and lauren what was your central question my central question the central question of your experiment oh it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there how much of it was still there okay or if it would affect the fabrics differently okay but your light probe is saying no they re all the same so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever should i take that as data i think you should take it as data yeah and it s okay you addressed your question which was how does oil affect it different among shirts in your case with the soap maybe not at all differently i d like you to try one more thing involving paper towels and what you re going to do is you re going to see you re going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there s any oil that s absorbed on the paper towels okay so that can be one other way to take data to see if there s still any oil still stuck in the shirts okay okay goggles on goggles on goggles on what s the highest temperature we could put it at are you guys boiling you can put it all the way up you just have to be really cautious get your hot hands out the big glove alright heather s group i m coming over to you guys ready okay what s going on over here we put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt okay ooh salt when i was a waitress we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out maybe you could put a second wait that s kind of like clay i was going to say flour because that s what we do if i spill what do you notice it s starting to kind of clump when we had the clay it was really really clumpy but then it it the uh yeah like the clay just clumped and then we had to get before and that didn t really make a difference it just sat at the bottom my hands are sticky oh thank you while you re here do you remember the charge of the particles of clay positive or negative negative okay so negatively charged particles and now you ve added sodium chloride which dissolves in water you ve got an a plus positive cl minus negative and you re clearly getting a scum ball no what happens when you turn it off it just all settles at the top when we put clay in there for the first time it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top but nothing of the magnitude so that motion really helps it to stay together yeah that s what we did we put it at 500 rpms first and then we dialed it back down to 100 let s apply this to the water treatment plant was there motion at the water treatment plant yes was there clay in the water probably from where from the sediment on the bottom of the schuylkill from the sediment on the river now remember the stuff that s going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home so it hasn t had a chance to go in the schuylkill river yet okay would there be any clay in the homes not in the homes no not in the homes not in anything flushed down the toilet yeah so yeah there could be some like clay like sediment sand particles going through or at the very least we could say that there s probably some negatively charged particles going through some kind of silicates shall we throw away the fabric sure who knows what s in feces right alright so what i think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form have you talked about cece s experiment yet no go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed also matt ian s sorry catherine s station is using sand specifically and i forget what the other material is it looks like peat moss and they re having no success so go ahead and do a little quick walk around and clean up motion can you let them give them a 10 second overview yeah and then go taylor pull it together you ll be okay you re good okay did you get any scum no we didn t we just got into lumps the fastest way we got a layer and then everything the soil settled on the bottom and then for the middle speed it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in clean up clean up,0.0
you re going to test and be coming up here for materials okay go you just follow the lines if no if the lines if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper the termites will follow the lines we should draw like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow and we ll make it like this well it s not going to be on a circle it can be like this and see if they ll follow that circle yeah would that be a good may i bother you with this i m just covering them up what are you saying yeah well beside this one if termites we ll place on a red piece on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines then the termites will follow the lines in the circle okay so you re going to use the color red line again what color paper would you use white white paper yeah and i think since we ve already used colored paper i think that s a result of that well again you could do yours and yours and tie them together use different colored papers so what s the point of your test that depending on the colored paper we ll determine what the termites sight can do i would think it s the color of the line because that s what they re following so you think they re following the color of the line yes yeah but when they went to the end of the white paper they went to the black and they came right back well no that s because they knew what it was that s because i like kept hitting them back okay so you re kind of going along with the idea of color how could you prove that color was that color effects their you draw a bunch of different circles draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size but of different colors and see which one they go to i like that nice okay on a white piece of paper yeah again i ve got colored paper the more tests you do the more accurate your results would be all right so let s do the same test but on two different types of paper so if termites are placed on a white piece of paper put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out no that down good and there you go so what were we thinking about testing um putting tables in line using different color and to see if we re not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around oh very nice yeah because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down they followed it down tricky okay they went it s true so they didn t follow this part yeah because it curves no because they we drew the circle they go like then they curve and go down and they came here and went back up they all followed hmm interesting thank you four you ve got about two more about a minute and a half actually what are we thinking i m going to go ahead and cover these up we were planning on doing um like we think they re attracted to the ink and i m going to test it with like a marker a pen and a crayon okay to see if like if they follow the ink better than the other ones nice would you use the same color of ink yeah because it would be the control there you go very nice um what color paper are you going to use should we use regular white i would say white yeah all right good okay sounds good where are your termites stop playing with them and we re going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out what were you guys thinking about testing mainly if they are going to follow the red line then they must be attracted to red they must be attracted to what red red okay so how could you test that they are just attracted to red we re going to make two large circles two large circles and some other lines and some other lines but what are you testing again if they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red okay so you re talking about the color red um would you use so you tell me what you re going to set up i m trying to follow probably just a black one and a red one lines or circles circles circles okay all right yeah basically just for fun okay okay just for fun all right um you should be collecting materials if pens and things aren t working let me know dude get the line what happened to your situations well we put tape over this and now it doesn t follow it over here i think they like the color red none of them are following any of these lines how could you continue to test that they like the color red put more red over here i mean we also put the tape there and it doesn t like the tape it gets confused and we have the red paper and it didn t follow the black lines or the pencil yeah that s what i mean none of them here are even doing anything they get tired and just start standing there twitching do you need some new ones no there are still pretty lively yeah so what are some of the conclusions that you re thinking oh terrance be sweet ah be sweet ah white on red they only like that also they only follow that type of pen they don t follow any other type of pen or pencil um they don t necessarily have an affiliation to red okay how do you know that cause they walked off the red paper okay they walked off the red paper so you threw that one out how could you continue to say that they like that particular pen and not having to do red we tried black pen we haven t tried another color on white yet see look it stopped at the tape it s confused at the tape no neal what i asked you is that a pen or a marker it s a pen it s a pen oh he s following the other we drew it on the other side we drew a circle on the other side it looked like he was following it is it something inside of them no like what the ink s made out of how could you test that using the red pen on this okay taking two different pens go grab some more that s a good idea red color pen red color pencil you killed the ant gentlemen be nice to your termites oh oh wait wait here neal let s get all right group here s a red pen colored pencil oh look that one s alive okay now then so what are you saying is going on they re still following the red one yeah they re still following the red pen so it s not necessarily an affiliation to the color red so it is something inside the ink so how can you test if it s something inside the ink i just got the other colored pencil take another red pen go grab some it s right there that s a pencil it s the color red look stick with the no you just threw out the idea that it s red stick with the color stick with the pen idea we need a pen like this no i think we have the exact same pen no no the blue one like this they have a blue one like that go see there s blue pens up there hey can we borrow a red pen i meant blue you know what i meant bam it s a different type of pen it s all right different type of pen but it s blue now did you get a blue one no i just got red ones i got bundles nice now they re going to follow it now i thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen i think it s that pen i ve got the same pen they re still the red i think they are okay try that one there s a hole there by the way if you press through it it will break go are you going to make it intercept the line yeah i m going to oh look he s following the little one maybe it likes circles wait wait i still think it s something inside the ink draw a square see if it follows a square so that would be able you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square so draw a square see what happens yeah draw a square i ve got another black pen i have all these pens why not draw the square inside of there inscribe the square in the circle terms terminology you re a professor now oh it s following it it is the pen curves are easier it didn t know where the line was okay five four um we drew different lines in the different types of pens markers colored pencils did you do it all on the same page or on different pages on different colored pages why would you do it on different colored pages ah to make sure the tests varied okay did you use the same color of ink on each page describe to me your experiment web the whole group can chime in too um like we drew like a black circle on a black sheet of paper okay to see if they could only like please don t be rude black circle on a black sheet of paper keep going what else and that didn t work they could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that christian came up with that take a white piece of paper and we drew like every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles none of the other colors what were the blue and the red circles drawn with i believe different types of stuff mainly pen though and this was all on one sheet of paper well we tried it on different sheets too okay that s what started us off okay um did you have it all on one sheet at first yeah okay what did you realize was wrong with that they were pretty much getting confused as in we re going to have issues with what maintaining a control a control good only one independent variable nice um nick s group how did you go through the indentation we drew several circles using each of the utensils and then i think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of if they weren t in the middle sort of eating off of the wood or like just exploring around they were following the pen okay um your indentation line did you draw that with just pens different types of pens did you draw it with markers did you draw it with a paper clip we just used the same color but we used different things like we used pens vis a vis colored pencils stuff like that okay and what was your conclusion with that they followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation because they came the termites into that line because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop and i figured oh well they must be blind because they can t see that there s a drop there interesting point why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation instead of a pen because it wouldn t have shown a color but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen okay so any components within that pen color chemicals type of pen whatever if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation you would have been able to do what pen verses paper clip pen would have looked i think it would have looked the paper clip would have looked deeper but the thing is like would it prove if you had it or not had what or not if they followed the dent or not not just like the color or the like smell or whatever very good very good so by using the paper clip to create the indentation they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent maybe the scent from the pen the chemical from the pen that left the indent by doing the paper clip just by itself we would have been able to say okay that obviously doesn t leave any chemicals it doesn t leave any color and if they re following that indentation we know that that s what they are drawn too okay carly your group had an interesting set up um we well we kind of did two all right but the first one we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with like white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper and that didn t really work so we did the other one and um with like the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper and they only went on the red pen one okay what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described as in something that might have thrown off the results paper i don t know well notice in one of the experiments you used a what to create the circle the pen okay you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what paper but you used a oh white yeah you used a white colored pencil so by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil what are those two things now added on what variables added on variables okay for one you re using pen and pencil another you re using colors so how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables gentlemen calm down we could have used colored pencils the whole time okay could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time good um what group haven t i talked to matthew explain to us the set up of your group do you want to start i don t know what to say oh okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it so we decided maybe it s not color so we took a black pen a big one um we took a black pen and then two red pens of different type and two blue pens of different type and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue it was the bic pens so we decided there must be something in that in the chemical structure of that ink that s you know similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort um and the termites followed it okay um did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday yeah after school that was extracurricular all right so but we figured out the bic pens we figured that out okay good excellent set up there were there any variables that when i was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens you got this yeah we were drawing with different shapes cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing so we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it and they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape it might be in the pen or the color they don t really like sharp angles though we drew a square and they got lost yeah they couldn t find the angle okay interesting so um if any of you did do any sort of research you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit and we learned that those were what pheromones enzymes enzymes not enzymes what are pheromones having to do with we just spent three days on it animal behavior animal behavior communication their chemical signals okay so we learned that termites emit these pheromones we might have encountered this last time and that s the same thing why ants follow a specific trail um when honeybees sense danger they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out that danger s coming but the pheromone that termite s emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen in bic and papermate pens actually mimics the chemical in the pheromones which is why they followed certain pens,0.0
i m not gonna have no peace with that if you feel something i don t know something like done bothered me that done made me like brought me down to the point where i was crying about it the first thing he say i ain t gonna tell nobody but i feel where you coming from he tell me it shouldn t get to that point where you mad over something that doesn t matter if it s good or not that seriously don t matter that s in the past the past ain t gonna do nothing the past can t hurt you okay alright that s what i d tell him so really this kind of conversation should ve been held with what kind of friend a pretty good friend a pretty good friend or maybe even your best friend nope not your best friend oh yes my best friend you already know who i m talking about he s my best friend now he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad i ask him man why you doing this i thought you was different from everybody else but not once have i actually went out there and played the cards while i m at home how i m not gonna tell nobody and then come two days later everybody and their momma walking up to him and asking him questions uh why you did this to her so let me ask you this so your saying you ve had conversations with your best friend before and then he s divulged information that you ve said to him no from time to time he might get mad and he ll say something then we have to have that one on one talk ok this was between me and you i don t want to hear this coming out nobody else s mouth cause then i know point blank that you done said something let me ask you this if you would have that conversation with someone is he truly your best friend is that a conversation that jay chime in any time if you got to keep reminding him that hey man if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else honestly are they really your best friend no like i said before that s another acquaintance because you can t trust him like that man he telling you he ain t gonna tell nobody but he going back on his word he going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat that s why i said it s about you johnny no between what you say i don t blame johnny if he s truly your best friend he won t tell nobody he won t tell anybody but then you got like it s a boundary between stuff you tell you can tell your best best friend something deep but it s a certain boundary between that which you wouldn t tell him certain stuff i tell my best friend almost everything but certain stuff he don t need to know right cause certain things we my business don t need to be his he have one of those days when he feeling down then i come over there blah blah blah don t say nothing to me then he flips out on me and he wanna tell something that s so deep to me that i m sitting there looking like did he really just say this cause your shocked you re in shock and you don t never expect well anybody wouldn t expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that s not meant to be told me i would never expect chris to say anything i tell him so far he has been a best friend he don t tell nothing i say i don t want to have to tell what he tells me because we got that best friend relationship cause a best friend should be loyal all the way to the end not when it s necessary or needed that s right not when it s necessary but at all times right yes ma am okay alright let me go to the next scenario you decide you would like to take in a movie but you choose not to go alone you finally reach someone by phone who is just as bored as you and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant you both enjoy yourselves so much you plan to do this again where is that person at on the grading scale i d say that s a group thing because they interested in the same thing that you re interested in group friend okay alright group friend group friend someone that you know through association now in this scenario it s just you and that person and it could be someone that you met through the group or it could be it s not necessarily your best friend you just started hanging out out of the blue you met them and when your friends not around y all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then i d say that s a pretty good friend pretty good friend i could say a pretty good friend cause i would hang out with a pretty good friend a pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y all enjoy yeah because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group kind of like we re together because once again you know that person through association of someone else but a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say okay you want to go out yeah you wanna go out let s go it s nothing between you guys if its a girl you understand that she just want to see the movie and i want to see the movie we laugh we joke we go out eat pizza together but it s nothing else there we ain t trying to be boyfriend girlfriend you can t try to make it more then what it is right then if it s just a friend one of your dudes that you hang out with y all like the same movie like i you know you can t call me cause we re not on the same level i m your teacher at all times even though you know i like the same type movies you like and we always discuss the same type of movie we re not going to go to the movies together cause you on the adult level we on the young people level right and we re different types of our friendship scale is different is not even up here it s right okay now someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum you were glad to hear it because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway so your parents tell you both that you can go and you can the exhibit is in a different city your parents tell you both that you can go and you can spend the night over out of town what kind of friend is that is that just an acquaintance that would probably be with like with my best friend i wouldn t go out of town with somebody that s not by best friend i ain t going to go out of town i got to go with somebody that i know is going to speak to me you know what i m saying mm hmm got to be somebody i can trust i don t have to many friends i can trust i don t know why but all my friends is just the reason why i don t get too close to them i can t exactly tell you why i just don t because i can t trust everybody okay alright because you ll never know who will be your best friend today and they might turn on you tomorrow so you ll never know okay so that s why this is a good piece to do because we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance who is someone we that we will just see on the hall hi how you doing bye got to figure out who is the acquaintance and then we got to figure out who is the group friend who is a good friend who is the best friend because there s somewhere there s a fine line like you guys said there s a fine line between all five of them but you got to know the line you got to know where the line is drawn you got to know the conversations to have with all of them because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend that you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall right right cause there like you just telling me your whole business but you don t really know my name or nothing about me that s something the stuff you telling me i wouldn t tell you i would tell it to my best friend but as far as what s going on in my house i ll probably let you know i got sisters and brothers the basic stuff but not oh my momma s strung out or doing this and that cause everybody s business is not your business your business is not are you that s right we always got to keep that in mind because so many times i ll get calls from parents and they ll say so and so just talking too much especially when people are getting into a lot of issues or getting into confusion at school or what have you and a lot of that comes from the fact that they don t know when to be quiet or they don t know what to say or how to say it or who to approach because if someone says to you stand up for a minute in the morning when you first come in and the first thing i say to you is what good morning good morning good morning vincent how you doing good morning ms jenson how was your weekend i went to my cousin house i got to spend time with my godmother and i went grocery shopping okay so that now you told me i didn t say what did you do oh i said how was your weekend it was good it was good and that s basics of that conversation it should not be oh guess what my momma my momma and her boyfriend was fighting and they threw the cat out the window and then the police came over because at that moment you have just did what stepped out of bounds you ve stepped out of bounds you ve divulged way too much too much you done opened the book before it could be read or you done read the book before it could be bought because really i didn t buy into all of that i didn t want all of that you just wanted to know your name and how was your weekend i just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend and then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper but you not asking for that you just asking for the simple that s right that s right jeremy i m going to ask you stand up for a minute jay cause you re a pretty secretive guy mmhm so normally we got to pull stuff out of you cause i said to you earlier i said your dad called and what was that about i was stuck on the river and he said i was stuck on the river my first thought was jeremy got a boat so i said you got a boat that s what i said right yeah i was over there at the wafflehouse over there by brian gates behind over there at the apartments i went to see someone and so he went to see someone but again sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation and when to divulge it and when to divulge it because even though he went to see someone he didn t give me no elaborate details yeah this honey she was because a lot of times you don t need that i don t need that you just wanted to know where i was at just wanted to know where you was at i want to make sure you was okay make sure that your dad got in touch with someone to be able to say jeremy s okay okay alright alright yeah you can have a seat that was a good conversation huh this was a good conversation this was a good conversation you thought this was a good lesson today was a good day it was a good day because some people don t know their boundaries of talking and telling it all some people just give up too much information some people around here got to even say what did to you and everything from here we re going actually the next thing we re going to discuss is conversations that s where we re going to go from here i wanted us to because the other day we kind of looked at friendship but i wanted to go a little deeper because i know i want us to realize that friendships they should be reciprocal not always and when i say reciprocal everybody understands what i m saying the same no should be the same like how i feel about you you should feel that same way about me i feel like you trustworthy but you feel like i m going to tell on you any chance i get right exactly but they re not always reciprocal but keep in mind that friendships are always changing because who you put down on your friendship scale on thursday it change it changed you gave me a whole different not a whole different set but you gave me some different people and you actually moved some people where you had yolanda as a good friend she became just a group friend four days later okay and you had valid reasons and keep in mind that things do change just because someone was a best friend last week don t mean they going to stay your best friend they re not nine times out of 10 i promise you guys when i was in high school i could there were three there was four of us and i considered them my very best friends now i don t know how deep they would ve had my back but i considered them my good friends we talked on the phone we shared secrets we shared stuff you know when we was sneaking and doing stuff we shared those things but today i really can t tell you where they re at now there was some friends that i met in college that we re still friends to this day they re friends that i ve had since i came into teaching that i don t know where those people are because i ve been teaching when you think of teaching for 18 years people have friends people have come and gone in the teaching profession but i haven t kept in touch with all of them because there has to be a there has to be something in common that s going to keep you friends it can t just be i see if i see them just at school and that s all we ever talk about is school and schoolwork and complain and fussing and about lesson plans and stuff then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates those are just acquaintances people that i pass in the hall we laugh we joke but we don t share any intimate conversation okay i m glad this was a good exercise for you guys and next time we re going to look into conversations the type of conversations you have with each one of those type people,0.0

at first we put only tap water in it and then we all of a sudden changed it so but there s still tap water in with the oily water so you think that s why the control got messed up because it had too much well that s not variables changed my only reason what s the other reason my other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was like the seeds were duds were your guys s the oil ones that one s not yours no ours is the one that s all grown oh why don t you go get your cup and show people so this is oil okay well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden it died it looks like kind of so like at first it was normal with that thing and then well i don t understand that chart yeah me neither because it looks like it looks like it didn t grow then it grew really really fast then it went down super what happened was it grew and then it over polluted and then it just died looks like that well like well like what i don t get is i see the other oil one it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones it just like suddenly grew all of a sudden all the oil is the same with the control which you have all of a sudden all of a sudden also these diagrams also in the control diagram that went back down to zero centimeters i don t know yeah this chart might have messed up because that means both these plants die and then the control regrew yeah it doesn t make any sense it doesn t it turned white and then it died and turned brown because on my chart it grew point it grew it grew 0 14 and then 0 14 again and then 0 04 so like alive dead alive and stuff when it grew the second time did it grow or did it subtract the second time i think it died and then the last time it just kept on growing but the first time it started growing it grew second time it grew one centimeter what did you put in to help it grow what did you put in it to help it grow oily water so did the oil or the manipulator control grow more the manipulative one grew more because it grew and then it died so why do you think it did that because like i what i thought is that it was too much oil on it and then oil gets on the leaf it like it helps the plant grow or something just killing other doesn t the plant feed off the leaves so the oil got spread on the leaves and then it s feeding the oil then it died look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant do you i think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because like acid is good for you and it s mixed with water so it s not too bad for the plant but i think it got way too much acid and acid actually eats things it kills it and that s why i think the plant is all dead because like you said nolan it did grow because acid is good for us but yet when we have too much it dies so that s why i think this plant is all shriveled over i agree with you because acid is part water and that s what rain is but there s a little bit of acid so water s good for you but acid it doesn t grow it s not good for you so well actually it is good for you but not a lot i think you re maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on maybe it got too much acid rain and then the acid rain overtook the water and died so it like decreased by a lot that s why i think it s just like the red bull because red bull is like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy see right there just like red bull it increases and then decreases what d you think misha well yeah i think like what you said nolan because the regular plant grew just fine and then that the experiment grew like good and better than the regular one but then it like the acid overtook the plant just like nolan said what else i noticed about my control plant it started big at first and then it decreased in size then it got bigger so it s going off and on in size so it actually did kind of better than this because at the end it did better than that one and the last opposite it like died after the second one it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks yeah but it was only to a point it was living because when i did my second observation it was still kind of full but it was broken on the side so it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water basically it died my actual skin and everything the plant grows faster but it also dies faster and i figured from like the oils on my hand why do you think it did that because the oil on your hand because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as like oils in a car but oil still has the same base but how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand i don t know instead of wearing gloves maybe it s just the stuff inside of the oils and everything but it grew faster and also died faster like the plant that we have now is dying faster but this one since it has water normally and everything it s healthy and stayed big the whole time but the other one is like that but it died if you have what you were saying earlier when you have oil on your hand and then it was you polluted it with oil don t you think you polluted that one too no well like it s my whole point is that it speeded up the process what speeded up the process like the oil when i plant a bean or something when i plant bulbs for tulips or something and i touch it with my hands instead of my gloves then it actually seems i may just be paranoid but it grows faster and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn t grow as fast i don t know the depth of that part or something i don t get what you re saying are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster no i think it s just the oils of your skin so what would the oils in your skin do for a plant like the oil for your plant here is it the same like the oil that we used like it didn t make them healthy but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger but the other one show me your data that suports that this yeah what s your data that supports that the these ones yeah the one the data that supported it was that oops is is it went with the control it already had grown and it was after a week and ours still hasn t grown and it was growing at 0 16 centimeters per day and then the next time it was growing 2 7 centimeters a day so what does that tell you that it was growing a lot faster but it wasn t necessarily growing as efficiently okay what do you mean by inefficient efficient what do you mean by efficient i mean like it grew faster but it wasn t necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast so was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn t healthy yeah because the leaves now they re all gross and blotchy and they re dying and they re crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these and they have a shine to them because of the oil what did the rate of growth confirm that at first it was kind of spiked for a little bit and then it started going back down and now it s dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants it grows in a steady period of time with that it grew really fast and now it s dying really fast so what conclusion did you get that oil still makes the plant grow but it s not necessarily healthy for it do you agree yeah because me and because my group my experiment when we did this it was growing super fast and now it s like dying and stuff and we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because on the grass a little bit and the number of leaves will only be like two and then it shrivels up and died and then the color would stay light green and kind of brown like how it is right now and then my data was according to my graph the acid rain plant grew more than i thought it grew 25 centimeters but it started to die because of it turns light brown and started to die the leaves increased from two all the way to six leaves by the end okay my question was what would the effect be if i changed the water to salt water and i put if i change the water to salt i predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant i predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant i predict the color will be white ish gray ish my manipulator variable is water to salt water according to my data i was correct because the height was the same and the number of leaves were the same the data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants the rate of the growth was zero on the salt water there was crust on it and it was restate that so that jessica gets it and see if jessica knows and then like we were saying olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt and then like you know how water it attracts a lot of light and so people get tan yeah faster and then so maybe the shine for the oil maybe it attracted more of the heat from the light and it burnt the leaves so like the glisten from it yeah maybe that s why it looks all burnt and because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it s a burnt reel piece of paper something like sands off in the reel of a video and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen that s what it kind of reminded me of because it has a brown wrinkle around it and then it s dark and then it s kind of brown and crisp so that s what it kind of reminded me of and that s what made me think of it yeah and then how i thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how olivia said that when you re in water it attracts more heat and light to you so maybe that s how so that s how i got the idea of maybe that s what happened so do you have anything to add jared no you jessica no okay okay so i think the reason why mine didn t grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water because when mr kelson sprayed it all of the salt right here you could feel it it s all stuck to the top so the water can t get down to the soil and all that so it can t grow at all,0.0
alright i heard the term velocity so i think that sounds pretty good velocity of a skateboarder the more important you re going to have i like velocity keep talking amongst yourselves i m just kind of here to guide you along make sure the people here i don t want anyone to have their back to each other i know the room is difficult to do that but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group i know it s difficult wait the whole class oh yeah i want the whole class to discuss this i thought you were doing like table and table no no no i want everyone to talk sorry okay you guys can talk just like i talk across the room feel free to do so so someone when we ask their velocity you need more length to the tracks steeper you don t have to raise your hand if you re looking in that person s eye or you re looking in my eye feel free to you need a longer track distance is it the friction i will tell you that we re not going to look at friction as part of the system let s look back at that proposal for one second just want to make sure i didn t miss anything it s always good to look at what they give us let s see what science terms are in there quantitative qualitative okay energy oh we got energy in there energy transfer oh energy transfer okay so i think they want something to do with energy it said quantitative we should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy right do we have them yeah we do it s half mv squared right and then what christina said we re going to be collecting data quantitative we ll probably have to use some formula that associates with this i agree okay okay he gave us the formula e sub k 1 2 mv squared energy due to the gravitational field e sub g mg alright let s make sure we know what each of these letters stands for m mass and the unit kilogram g acceleration due to gravity lauren said force of gravity okay you want me to write that in which one is it oh its the effect from the gravitational field okay that s fine you will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force but what are the units for this meters per second squared so that can be kind of confusing if they re calling it gravitational force and then they re saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units acceleration acceleration right so i m going to put acceleration due to gravity okay good h is height yeah h is height and that s in meters sounds good okay so now we go over here mass and kilograms and then velocity and that s in meters per second good and then if you remember that force doesn t like careless errors so maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units so what are the units that we re going to have for e sub g and e sub k what is it joules joules oh that s right how do you remember that i m smart okay that s good too oh there was a pretest that had that on there that sounds good okay great you re taking that prior knowledge energy is a jewel energy is a precious jewel alright you want precious okay there s jewels there s semi precious and there s precious what are they diamonds and rubies so energy is a precious jewel kilogram times a meter per second squared newton newton good newton times a meter a joule a joule right over here mass and kilograms kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared don t forget the square kilograms times a meter again is a newton newton times a meter that s going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then multiply that by that meter and again you get joules okay we want to make sure that we don t did everyone see how we got that joule there meter times another meter right yeah because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton times a meter remember this is meters squared because of that oh okay okay so you know the boss doesn t like careless errors so let s make sure that we have the appropriate units okay i don t mean to interrupt you guys why don t you continue with that you ve got some formulas here now for potential energy wouldn t mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants so height is the only one that that could manipulate so if the height is the greater distance from the earth then it would have more potential energy because they re directly proportional yes let me ask you guys i can t help but interrupt once in a while right but i just wanted to if i put this marker on the table does this marker have potential energy what is the reference point oh oh oh the table no the center of our planet yes okay so i heard a fight i think that s a good thing the more danger the more fun i thought right yes they re going to wear their headgear is this guy wearing any head oh he s wearing head protection why is that important by the way so the force doesn t apply to your head okay i like that ah inversely proportional right i like that yeah so it increases the amount of time decreases the force so yeah danger is an aspect here but this guy seems like he s doing okay he s got his headgear on but that s definitely if you re designing a park you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren t going to be injured there are going to be accidents with skateboards but they ll wear their gear i m going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier okay so how high do we want the if we want it to have a bigger potential energy transferring the bigger kinetic energy we might want to have the height from the reference point which is the ground and kind of higher i heard reference point let me see if i can put a reference point on this i did just put a little click a button and get the reference point okay i think the thing should be on the ground yeah the weight s like it s safer and it s possible do you want me to just to extend the we ve got a couple of things going on here i m sorry a couple people said yes they wanted me to put that on the ground so if those people could say that again that would be great say that again you want to put it on the ground and i think i heard a dissenting voice in the crowd someone that said something else i did oh okay i said that if you increase the height it s still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side technically you d be able to go back and forth they haven t brought in the supports for this herculean innovation that s right i mean i don t think it really is going to affect the design structure so whether it s on the ground or i ll just pull that down that s fine yeah i don t think that s going to make a difference that might make it easier for the person to step off the track too when they re done you know this guy s going to get really tired there s no friction so he won t have to step off on the nice safe track but you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn t go back up as high so if you have alright one at a time i like this someone said something christina said something and i think karuna wanted to add to that he goes just as high like there s no change because there s no friction so yeah then he doesn t go up to the top i could put the pie chart in sure and can you start him at the top alright so i m going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to he s going to climb up the ladder right there s like a pretend ladder here and then how s that yeah okay now i noticed when i did that something happened the pie chart oh yeah why sounds like a height there that s increasing reference point is greater i like that okay i m going to let him go i don t know if i can do that actually but i will try yeah we can play around with it make the sides taller then he ll have a greater distance to travel and it ll actually be more i don t know if i can yeah i don t think i can do that i don t think it ll it only allows me to click on the blue dots there you have to add track to do that you want me to pull those off to the side okay okay so you made a little bit different half pipe oh no alright so you don t want to look there s some thermal energy what s going on with that okay that might ve happened but why do i now see red in the pie chart yeah there s a force that will allow for the energy to transfer good let s get him back on that half pipe and you know guys i don t think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up so i don t really think that is going to make much of a difference but we do need to collect some data and start with this proposal so where did we leave off i think there was something that we were looking to collect there height okay good let s continue with that please well measuring tape oooh there is a measuring tape i don t even see these things measuring tape oh it even says fet okay good so how s that look no no well what do you want me to do with it going to the ground that s not the ground from the reference point oh alright i m right on the reference point go up a little so what do you want me to measure well where am i going to measure from what to what the reference point to the highest point okay i think the highest point would probably be the center of him but they do have that nice little red dot can we just agree that we re going to go with the red dot yes yeah why don t we go there it can t be diagonal okay is that good yeah yes shut the lights off for this measure okay now this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with i wonder if there s any easier way for me to get this oh oh that s pretty neat i suppose i could use a measuring tape or i actually have that so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier if it could speed things up so what do we want to say for the height seven i don t know if i d say seven so we all agree it s somewhere between six and eight yes yes i d say 7 2 and it does go over the seven a little bit so height equals seven point two four six zero you tell me or it s going to go forever let s start over again seven i don t think it goes to the half mark 7 1 maybe we need a show of hands on this who believes it s 7 who believes it s 7 meters no one s raising their hands that s good how about 7 1 7 1 meters alright i got one person there now i m looking at this from an angle right and anytime you want to make a measure you do want to have your eyes right above what you re measuring and obviously i m just going to move over here just so i can get a little bit better and then what else can i do to try to really measure this well pause it yeah i think i m going to pause the animation now if i was making an actual measurement i d make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever i was measuring what do we say about oh that s good what do we say about these measures that we make in science they should be you re only as good as your measures yeah you re only as good as your measures what does that mean kristen it means that if your measures are not precise and consistent then everything else won t be precise and consistent can someone elaborate on that a little bit or do you want to add to that no someone else can elaborate on it okay are you sure i can give you a little more no okay let s see who haven t i called on at all today because i want to make sure i get everyone you haven t called on jill alright i m sure she doesn t mind repeating it for you i think you said you re only as good as your measures because if your measures aren t precise then all your other work that you re using the measures for yeah if you measure something for speed it would be wrong why well no if you it could be you re right if you make some poor measures and then you go to graph it no if you take distance and then multiply it by time then speed would be wrong like if you had the wrong distance then speed would be wrong and then making it after that your graph would be wrong well it would be wrong right from the perspective you said distance times time and speed is distance divided by time did everyone hear that yeah that s okay though you re saying we don t want to get off the main idea here if you re getting these distances wrong and then you re going to graph your slope is going to be incorrect yes so remember in science we collect data from that data we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns graph it look at trends and patterns so if everything starts from our measures those next steps aren t going to be correct,0.0
today i m going to introduce to you our new project and it s based on the concept of surrealism when you look at this word you should recognize a smaller word within it does anyone recognize the smaller word real real that s right the word real and we know real is the way things really look when we see them or the way they appear but the word sur transforms that word and because this is a french word sur means beyond so now what the word surrealism implies is beyond reality or the way things really appear so what does that look like it looks very dreamlike it doesn t necessarily make sense a lot of different things go on in surrealism and i m going to show you a few examples right now these are the three characteristics that we re going to focus on the first characteristic is out of place objects if you look at this example up here what s out of place in this picture can anyone tell me trevor the guy s face what s over his face just floating there can anyone tell you re up close matthew you see what that is an apple it s a green apple okay and that is an out of place object definitely surreal these are examples of surrealism this example right here what s in here jordan train there s a train coming out of a fireplace okay again an out of place object these are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes scenes that do not make sense they re beyond real what s going on in this scene kurt there s like giant butterflies yeah the butterflies grew they re huge now they re like the props on the windmills what s going on in this can anyone tell what makes that surreal john like huge makeup yeah the si again the size of such little things grew tremendously and they re filling up the room also the interior of the room is now looking like the sky so what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really really big the last characteristic that we see in surrealism is there it is normal objects acting abnormally so in these examples i ll go through real quickly do you see these clocks they re not acting normally these clocks are melting they re dripping they re stretching they re falling down you can see that in this one the artist drew a person looking into the mirror but does he see his reflection no no the mirror s not operating normally it s surreal it s beyond real what it s doing is it s showing the back of his head and again in this one it s kind of hard to tell but there are three swans and the reflection is of three elephants so the reflection in the water is not acting normally these are three characteristics of surrealism all right so why surrealism why this style of art does anyone have any guesses of why anyone or why these artists created something like this yeah because it s like a modern form of art okay yeah that s actually a very good definition cara maybe to make it look interesting okay good to make it look funny okay good guys those are all excellent excellent answers here is another thing that went into surrealism like lots of art it s influenced by what s going on around it or what happened before it so these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism and the first style of art is known as dada art this type of art is where the artist took things and they tried to make something that wasn t considered art they took random objects like a bicycle wheel and the stool and put it together and said okay this is not art and that was an example of the style they also took a famous painting like the mona lisa scribbled mustache and a beard there it is that s not art and that was really the whole idea of dada it was like anti art another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something and in this example it s the idea of death there s this dark angel depicted over this man who s already halfway down in the ground all this white snow that symbolizes life around him and it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols and that s what that one depicts the other example or another influence of surrealism is metaphysical painting this one s very very hard to understand and that s what the idea was with the style it was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation basically one in which you do not know what you re looking at you don t know what the objects are you might know something but you don t know why it s there or what part of it it is and it s very very illogical and doesn t make sense these three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism so when you look at these three styles of art you can kind of see what they led to they led to this style of art which is known as surrealism so now where to start here s what s going on today today you are going to start with and you can open your folders up and you ll see this slide what we re going to do is we re going to start drawing today we are going to start by making a connection all right and if you look at this example up here on the board or and you can look at your slides too what we re going to do you can just take your stuff off leann leave it back there and then join your table okay what we re going to do is i want you to come up with something that means something to you and that s like your theme to start with maybe it s a hobby an activity a memory anything that s meaningful to you that s your starting point then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise so these are our options that i just discussed those are the characteristics do you want to move it around change the location of it do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn t be doing let me give you an example lily what s your favorite food strawberries strawberries what s your favorite holiday joe christmas jacob what s your favorite animal a dog okay so this is my surrealist example to you you have a christmas tree but instead of a christmas tree you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it so that s kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example these are some examples that i have that i did these are some of my drawings this first one and sometimes you don t even know where these drawings are coming from i wanted to take an object and stretch it i wanted to make it act abnormally so i chose a spoon and what i did was i thought well a spoon needs to catch something so this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops why because it s really dry wherever it is you can see all the cracks so that was kind of like my first idea the second sketch that i did was i wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting an unreal scene in an unreal place so what i thought was well pineapples are tropical why not cut open a pineapple and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees okay you re probably wondering what we re going to do with these today is sketching but what s going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting this is an example of what the painting might look like when it s all done i chose the pineapple one all right so we are going to be doing a watercolor painting but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting s going to look like up here on the board i think this is going to help you a lot this is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings and there s a variety of different things that the artist has done they might be food they might be animals they might be instruments they might be people they might be landscapes there s lots of things to look at i want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings i m going to give you paper right now use this sheet start with making a connection all right start with making a connection and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal all right how do you draw hands hands that s okay hands you know what this is just a sketch so this is a detail that doesn t or this is a part that you don t really need to worry about so tell me what s going on what makes this surreal um that s what i want to know because it s the birthday party in the present okay so which of these options do you think you re focusing the most on this one okay and why because a present usually doesn t open okay so the present so the party is within the present so the present gets opened up and then there s a party okay what else can we do to make it like maybe a little bit more like bam something going on that s the only thing i was thinking about you know like maybe like balloons and yeah balloons like they re com they re flowing out that d be really cool all right that s good what should i like do for like for like the face the face on a baseball baseball and what are we using for the parts of the face so this is a baseball bat okay and i okay these are the baseball bases oh the bases okay yeah and this is and this is okay so you re combining you re combining a lot a lot of different things so why freckles because like i thought putting more into it would make it more interesting okay you know what i think would make this really more interesting is the background what s going on around the face um think about it think about it what could we do where could this be in the sky i don t know so what would represent the sky what could you draw to represent the sky clouds try that maybe draw some clouds i think i think that s going to make your picture more interesting something like that because like someone hit a home run yeah okay and maybe some action lines around the ball you know like a little yeah that looks really good i like that i like that one a lot a dog eating pizza okay brittney yeah i don t know how to draw horses a horse yeah why do you need a horse because i want to draw like a horse what were you going to do like a horse a horse with a farm inside of it inside of it so what do you mean inside of it though like in here do like a farm and cows and well here s a suggestion because i like your idea a lot why don t we we can use this as a resource why don t we draw i ll help you with this just the back of the horse okay so we ll just work we ll focus on like the neck and the back and then the tail kind of coming down like this okay so you see where i m going with this now what i m thinking is why don t you draw your farm scene on the back like almost that it s like kind of been placed on there like a little miniature scene like so maybe on here you could draw the silo the barn and everything on there good eyes on me one two three okay guys you re doing a really really good job with your sketching and everything and i don t i want you to keep going but we do need to stop for a minute and based on the drawings that i m seeing i see some really good examples of surrealism and you re showing me that you understand it i bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art you could pick out the one that represents surrealism take a look up here on the board i have three tabasco sauce posters okay one two three and four show me with your fingers holding them up in the air which one of these is an example of surrealism think about it for a minute while you think about it i m going to wiggle my mouse so i can okay what s an example of which one is a jess okay everyone had four that s good why why that one why d you pick that one because like nope hold on i was going to let jessie answer first what makes that one surreal think about it michael go ahead the sides are like coming off the bottle okay and the pepper s like putting out the sauce okay good anything else erin it s like out on this like island yeah definitely definitely like a lot of things make this one surreal what does surreal mean again who remembers me it means like not like like not real but like in a different form right beyond real beyond real okay and this is a great example of that beyond reality okay here s what i need you to do now okay i have one more oh i might have to re i have one more slide that i want to show you up on the board and if you open up your folders you ll see this you ll see this slide and i printed it out for you what i m going to have you do right now in the next couple minutes i m going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table you might have to switch three ways or four ways or one way and i want you to assess the drawing that you get now if you get one that has lots of drawings just pick one of them okay here s what i want you to do on the sheet this is easy first thing what s the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received write it down maybe you noticed a big basketball maybe you notice whatever it is write it down then i want you to check these little circles whichever of these options that you see that that person used i want you to check them out okay michael and then i want you to write this is the one that everyone stumbles with they re like what does this mean all i m saying is what do you think that person meant in that drawing what do you think the meaning is if you don t know put a question mark all right and then what suggestions do you have for that person maybe they you know if you did a background it would look really nice or maybe you know what maybe you ve got to lose something you ve got way too much going on i can t tell what it is so this is not going to take you very long but it s important because it shows that shows me that you understand what you re looking at and it also helps the person get a better drawing which is going to be used for the painting so i want you to switch drawings right now everyone switch and i want you to use the sheet and i want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you re looking at okay so you re going to do this independently and i ll come around and i ll check with you in a little bit that s the first thing that you see write down the first thing that you see all right so lily what s the first thing that you see in your in this picture okay what do you think it is okay what do you think this is as a whole don t say anything because i know it s yours but this is good because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to so what s the first thing that you know that you th what do you see just maybe you recognize it just as water anything else maybe a blanket okay write that down okay that s a good start what s the first thing that you saw almost everything is crooked that s a good ob that s a really good observation because everything is crooked good so what options do you think were used in this now which one did you select normal object acting abnormally that s right it s clearly these objects are acting abnormally that s good that was a good that was another good observation so you just keep moving through did you write down your first reaction mm hmm okay and okay so normal objects acting abnormally,0.0
okay look at your music we are doing four parts obviously with them take just a general idea for the whole thing raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes sopranos where do you have eighth notes shelby tell me measure nine say it really loud so they all hear you measure nine measure nine very good audrey where do you have eighth notes measure thirteen thirteen good reese where do you have eighth notes measure nine and measure measure nine and thirteen hey what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part then same rhythm almost the same rhythm all the way through tenors where do you have eighth notes braden twenty one and twenty two twenty one and twenty two so getting toward the very very end altos tell us something about your part rhythmically raise your hand give me a summation of what you do jamie we don t have any you don t have any at all you only have quarter notes half notes and some whole notes so how many beats does a half note take up everybody two two make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes solf ge what key are we in where is do brady f f major so the first pitch that the altos have is do do sopranos what s your starting pitch mi basses what s your starting pitch do tenors sol very good look at it for a second there are some jumps in the very beginning they don t mess around right away we ve got some eighths and some intervals chant on solf ge your part one and two and three and four and very good go on two three four on the second to last measure on the first page bassists and altos will move stepwise motions so you ll they both go up one step be aware of that notice that we have some repetition do you see some patterns that are coming back so if you miss it the first time you get a second shot where if you get it right the first time remember what it sounds like so you can do it again continuing second page one two three and chant freeze let s go back and join the basses with us at measure nine do re mi everyone measure nine and okay sopranos careful it might screw up your voice why did you have an issue there why did you miss it it s a skip because it s a skip in the melody and why else a practical reason here to here because it s hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one top of the next page measure seventeen a little faster and go sorry seventeen sopranos fa altos la tenors fa basses fa ready hey everybody has fa that might be a good place to find the measure la this will help you re right sorry except the altos listen right there when you re actually singing for that and go you ll have to hold this for a very long time go back to the beginning the rule is number six jesse repeat the last step the last step oh never quit singing never quit singing look up find your keys points okay second key do mi so mi do so do sing your starting note one two three four good now i have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads do a quick run through because it s hard to know i cant remember what i missed i m still freaking out about the whole thing take a minute replay it in your head find areas where there were problems for you overall you did extremely well you listened to each other you could hear that it sounded like music if you weren t sure about an interval you would sing it and then you would go oh this is right yes and you were affirmed and i think you got more confident as you went along problem areas raise your hands if you had one chelsea my problem i had was with measure seventeen seventeen sopranos do to fa that s a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there so then you heard it and you were able to go on and then i liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen finding fa that s a strange function in the music yes patrick measure nineteen fa to la okay nineteen fa to la just making sure that you know where you re moving fa to la where oh nineteen yes sorry my eyes were at seventeen good bass hands excellent thank you grant where twenty twenty yes and what did you do i couldn t figure out the notes i mean i couldn t figure out the i think it surprises you because you move up by a step you were fine so la and the ti you weren t willing to actually sing ti because it s not very often that you sing it stepwise motion so la ti do you did an excellent job basses throughout then returning to so and do when you had it you had some issues with fa and la colin six and seven where we were going from la to fa and then back to do and then we had an eighth notes because of that okay so being aware of when you have eighth notes and chances are there isn t ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don t so when you hear it then you can move with them and it s always by step when you have eighth notes and it s always ascending so you don t have to worry about going down anywhere but yes fa and la continue to be icky i didn t time it we have to sing it again i m so sorry okay so we fixed the things that we missed we re going a little faster so it sounds like music and not just this exercise listen across the room to each other do mi you stayed very well in tune do mi so mi do so do set your key remember you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can if you look up basses i m trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often sing your first note please one two three four have a seat and now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second that means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time and if you haven t had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet it s time because this is opinion time and there s no wrong the room is going to tip over from the hands on this side there are four sections jamie well sometimes they re like a step away from each other but something like i know they re like one long and sometimes i okay so there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time okay hannah i thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time i would agree the first time you did better than the second there are a couple of reasons for this raise your hand if you feel like when you think back on how well you ve done both times you did better the first time why why emily because you were so focused and trying to get it right so the second time we ve already gone through it so we relaxed a little and little things slip up okay some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much what else possibly colin i think some of us got a little too over confident ohhh that s an excellent thing to check just making sure some of you don t get a little over confident although basses the fa s and la s were much better this time as an overall section amanda if the first time usually there s a few problem areas for me then i try to focus on them way too much and then i see the spots where it might have been tricky for me like that jump from la to do so i freak myself out about that even though i got it right both times you get stuck in your head a little bit yeah okay so doubting yourself and then not being sure what else can happen ariella along with what emily said about how we sometimes get over confident because we ve already seen it and we just fly by it because we re not really trying to pay attention to it too much okay ryan measure nine it s the so so mi i went back to the so because that s what we did on the first page oh okay because you re remembering now the patterns that you had you get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time that s a good thought too michaella between the and because we to sing notes over and over again over and over again i didn t like it it s kind of hard i didn t get the first two notes right and finally on like the third note i think i just figured out what we were doing patrick i think that sometimes because we ve already sung the music and now i think that we kind of know what s going on,0.0
okay so they re equal because of right angles theorem you are skipping a step again trevor tell him the definition of an altitude you tell me i have an altitude you have to tell me then what s the consequence of an altitude read the definition of an altitude say it the definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle i don t know how to word that right but somebody help him out he s making sense but somebody yes alright it goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly if that s a word don t say through because an altitude is bounded it starts at a vertex and it goes okay so now isaac what should be the consequent step two there right here yes whatever they gave you in those definitions trevor s and the improved definition by trey nobody said anything about congruent angles what did we talk that they re both right angles that they re right angles no we didn t that bd is perpendicular to ac ah ha that s what i got nice that s what it is so just write on top of that honey right here yeah the step two you should have that right you have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that s what reason says it comes from a defintion and why is that because of tell him why is that definition of altitude definition of altitude okay you see how when we were working with the picture we put those boxes on the triangle what did those boxes say indicate that they re right angles they re right angles okay so that should be and why do we have right angles somebody tell me why do we have right angles definition of perpendicular lines yes that s a consequence if you have perpendicular lines so i m going to write adb and cdb are right angles yes yeah okay you guys the rest of you might have started with the fact that it s an angle bisector right yeah yeah and that s okay if you started with that it s okay doesn t matter you could have started with the bd is congruent to bd you don t have to start with a given but that s traditionally the way we do it i can t believe i got this it s because of it s the definition of perpendicular lines what s this okay wait breathe in and out now let s go see what s going on okay step to the side adb and cdb okay still you need to have an angle a side and an angle do you have a congruent angle after all that work i m going to do that now okay what are you going to put angle adb is congruent to angle cdb because the definition of right angles nope right angle congruency right angle congruency theory well i haven t what is the definition of right angle that all right angles are congruent what s the definition of a right angle 90 degrees it measures 90 degrees yeah yeah all right angles are congruent is the right angle theorem that he s writing okay let s see what we have if you would number them that would help that s one and what s the consequence for after one i m trying i am old and somewhat blind from here but i know is that a 2 right under that at the perpendicular line you have 2 what is that ad is perpendic no after that angle adb is congruent to angle cdb wait he wrote it it s all jumbled up and it s all there so but wait a minute let s make sense out of this because it has to flow okay you know when you have your perpendicular line what should be at the perpendicular line the direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines is what that the angles are somebody somebody that they re right angles i want to say that but then i just don t want to say something that s wrong no you re fine you were not here yesterday and it seems you re doing great hey so take the blue marker so that everybody can see take the blue marker because i would like to re number it so they can see it okay so re number them again one is the given the altitude so you want me to write over yes and then that s two now what should be three don t put three on that one what should be three somebody tell him what should be three the angles the right angles yes okay now honey after you have right angles what are you going to say that uh definition of right angle theorem no okay so right angles what happens after right angles because remember angles are angles i need to talk about angle congruency but you haven t said that you talked about right angles so now what are you going to say you have it there honey angle adb is congruent to angle cde okay so that should be the next step that s four okay you remember good great remember when i asked you at the beginning when we first started doing proofs to keep track so you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle yeah right here not yet we haven t touched that guy yet we don t even have a number for that guy he s just floating in there what angle is congruent to what angle have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle yeah adb is you just did right okay go cross out one of the as i don t think you specifically did this but i ve noticed that some of you i ve noticed in abby and i would notice in a couple of you taylor that you were always after you prove something you found it within your proof you would kind of cross it out in here okay i found this or some of you would come over here and actually write it here it s like you re taking attendance i need angle for an angle i already have an angle keeping going see what i m doing here i showed you this way back yeah he s probably getting confused because of number three how he put adb because it should be abd and dbc instead of adb wait what what what number three the original number three yeah the b should be in the middle instead of d it should be abd and dbc that s right that s why that s why yeah i didn t noticed that yeah i thought he put that you guys are smart yeah that s how you got confused with everything else okay so now segment be is congruent to segment be because of reflexive property so that s another side and then it s given that bd is an angle bisector so that means angle abd is congruent to angle cbd okay but the issue here is he hasn t listed that as a given right just like people say well you re making that up how do you know that and you just say it s given but you didn t write it yeah he did yeah yeah he did it s right there it s number four he just did it wrong it s backwards it s all there so that should be step wait a minute one two three four five four should be one whoa three should be two one should be so there s a one two three four and then five wait five right here six right above it six seven okay can you change the numbers fix the numbers yeah please fix the numbers it s there okay we got it we have an angle bisector the consequence of an angle bisector we have an altitude the consequence of an altitude we have reflexive property so do you have them all yeah so what could you say now the triangle i m going back to the black marker okay let s get him out of the hot seat okay micah yes micah you tell us is he finished with the proof no why because you said no who said no you but okay you re supposed to tell me if there s something well you have to put that it is the i don t know frank to the rescue he hasn t proved that it s isosceles yet and how do you prove that it s isosceles i don t really know that sounded so tough frank yes okay you say segment ab and segment bc are congruent by c wait how do you say it cpctc corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent i always mess it up i can t do the cpc i can t do that i say the whole thing okay now frank is he finished i think is he no not yet no he s not okay why tell him why since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because ab is congruent to bc so what should be his number 10 triangle abc is isosceles and that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle yes i m so proud it keeps getting better i told you it would get better teamwork i was stressing last night because i was like it s so hard okay you guys understand what this means but i m trying to hurry it good job isaac yeah isaac a good job very good isaac one big clap for isaac one two three alright yeah you did good okay so you know what this is the proof that the new program where i give you because i want to make sure you get it enough information to do this on our own okay and then i m not going to write it out we re going to talk about how to do it and then you re going to complete it tonight at home so what do we need to do what is given there jonathan what s given the middle one this one honey cb is an angle bisector of acb cd is an angle bisector of acb okay what does that give you once you have an angle bisector no that s not it don t look at that one that s a totally different proof this is one that i m going to give you tonight so what does cd being an angle bisector of angle acb mean,0.0
i think that igneous and metamorphic they re the least there are two books that don t use em cause they re well my igneous yeah it igneous and metamorphic cool off and react and only a few particles came off but i was yeah it s just awkward because mine was boosting most of yours well yeah when i did my alien on my first try it was 42 grade then now when i m measuring it again it was 22 grade it mine never changed all it did was lost a little bit of it s rice crispies that was mine but i feel like igneous rock like 20 well yeah cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock s outside and mine was the same as igneous and metamorphic and so if i d shake it like through weathering a bunch of rock would fall off i haven t done anything yet it was three i can t wait to oh i have to say the one with the marshmallows cause it s well for my sedimentary it was harder yeah mine too what cause when i did mine only one piece of my sedimentary broke apart and the sedimentary my igneous rock it has like almost it might be a little inaccurate since these are not real sedimentary rocks you have to keep that in mind well yeah so but what if they were real sedimentary would we be able to tell what they are yeah obviously do you know any sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar yes i saw them in my yard they re called a granola ball no that was probably granite which is an igneous rock for jeanie do we write just how many lasts cause mine must ve had okay so when i when i did the blendering of my sedimentary i lost only three grams off of my sedimentary rock so i m not sure what would happen if i add these two because of the heat out of the cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue metamorphic rocks what would happen was the heat would melt it and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil yeah that s how that happens because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while yeah like last we and like have you ever heard of a rock that s called metamorphic rock yeah it can be greasy let s talk about why we use the models obviously you re never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that s like the taffy why did we use the laffy taffy for our model because the heat and the pressure the heat and the pressure would like stick together but like a sedimentary rock we use our fingers to add that heat pressure we had to simulate it somehow we couldn t do the actual earth process in the classroom do you agree with that mm hmm okay so you understand why you understand why we use that material for our model okay right it probably melts and why did we use the microwave for the igneous rock because what were we trying to simulate there from magma is a really hot substance and this is what igneous rocks can form from could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom no no could we work a marshmallow yep so we understand the connection there we re trying to use materials that we can bring into the classroom but that will still simulate lava magma the processes okay so pressure i think it has less effect of all the it had a lesser effect going through the processes of of both weathering and erosion and erosion okay now you guys can think about this if you didn t like the samples and examples up here that i used you could always do it different food material to make up your own experiment later okay let s talk for a moment why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion why are we measuring again look at your rock samples do they look the same as what we measured in here no no what happened you have to measure the difference the difference and why would there be a difference what could we do to our rock samples changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them let s use the same what did you use when you pre measured i would keep it the same why would i keep it the same because it s can we compare centimeters to inches yes you can think about that because later when you have to come back and do the difference how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches how can you compare those two measurements you re telling me you wanna go centimeters here but inches down here i would keep it the same they would make it mathematically you working on your difference your difference in mass this your pre mass explain to me how you got to that where are the books they might add on to another sedimentary rock cause it s like never ending for some reason my sedimentary and my igneous rock they both lost a half inch in length yeah mine too in my igneous rock grams it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams mine lost no grams mine gained grams your gained grams yeah i had 17 grams i had 17 grams and then it came back to 21 and this one went up one because when this one went up three maybe you should check that over cause it weathers and erodes away well i m guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people s stuff went into mine and made it bigger cause it can do that it can see right there all around the oh i see it see other bits and pieces of other people s went into mine and made mine bigger with mine a bunch of bits and pieces and mine started to melt because your observations say it crumbles apart it s breaking apart and moving okay what about these gaps here these gaps yeah how you gonna do that for some reason my igneous rock into the sample it made it bigger made it heavier did it have more mass after the your protective sleeve s coming off that s a good possibility that might throw your measurements off did it happen to anything else any other sample now you re working on a difference in you gotta find the difference in length and width and you re gonna find the difference in mass that s interesting you could explain that away right there mm hmm isn t that the one igneous the one you were saying got the strange results you can talk to me then well that s probably how they make the canyons bigger maybe because some of the rocks after rain and the sandstorms they could just pound together and make a big old rock so okay so if it erodes off another rock i m listening are you talking about real life rocks when they really erode away mmhmm and it starts to rain cause a lot of times it s like wind and rain a lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain with the rain and here s another rock which makes a bigger you re thinking sometimes with real life rocks you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks right do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock okay so that would also cause reason for your measurements i like where you re going with that try to make that connection you know unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how metamorphic rock s not made of laffy taffy so how s this go back to rocks in real life think about that some of our videos that we were watching about what salts quartz in these two processes you have to let the water go down cause the heat inside of it could ve frozen cause they heat over there we had it kinda whoa what s the answer 19 grams 19 igneous igneous how could you make that explain it to your little sister she s not gonna be able to understand that she wasn t here what could you put on your rock cycle diagram okay so you re gonna have this is 17 17 for what igneous what about sedimentary tell me how sean needs help um he needs help with okay where he s trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock what do ya mean no i was saying that it may have gotten darker darker because of the heat yeah a lot of rocks do that yeah but it could be jus the pink yeah it could be i could write down that it could be pink yeah what happened to my metamorphic rock is i can yeah that s because of this thing in between our finger and mine it didn t get darker than mine though so you could add that to what you put in so how would that affect our measurements how did it affect your width igneous and sedimentary rock could now talk to me though if it s in you wanna know why those are there because a lot of rocks don t have protection that doesn t help them and a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag which mixed with the sedimentary it could and sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around guess what it would do it would also become a sedimentary it s just like the rocks it s just like the rocks in life it s more similar to real life yeah the eroded bits would stick to other rocks so i just added like bits we have bits and pieces see if i was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this this would also become this because this isn t on the mat this would begin to stick and when you ball it together it makes it appear coloring to it that show that it s inside there i think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock after each sample ones that were weathering and erosion so you re gonna compare your two measurements pre measurement post measurement to see if there s a difference for each rock hmm hmm do we have to subtract do we what s your key word that could tell you what to do difference go show me i know you re thinking you just told me what key word tells you what to do where were we finding the mass after we ve done the weathering and erosion okay are you gonna get started yes yes jack are you finished with that scale can we use manners please can we use manners can you say please pass the balance talk to me guys just for a moment about the differences in those in your we ve got ashley s igneous we talked about that i figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen because they put the sedimentary came on to the metamorphic so we can see again how just and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag that s how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock and i think it became darker because the heat because of the pink and because of the pink yeah okay think about in real life sedimentary rock when those levels when those layers are smashed together okay don t some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure okay that was your metamorphic yes brooke and also you get the igneous in there it sticks to it and you can just put it inside there cover the layers off and it actually gets inside the metamorphic so you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks and how they could combine with one another and result in a completely different rock okay so on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome not the candy rock cycle the real one it says that you could use a diagram okay using your textbook level readers science journal or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle okay my igneous has gone down just a bit,0.0
we have been talking about being a good speaker and a good listener and in class your teacher had you do an activity in your classroom where you sat across the way from a student and you read them a paper that you had written about dingoes and then you had to stand up in front of the class and you had to present that do you remember that okay so we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener and your teacher and i worked on a rubric and you got a grade for some different things about speaking do you remember what any of those things were that you got a grade on do you remember what she was looking for posture posture what do you mean by posture not moving around okay so when you re standing up in front of the class what would you look like standing straight okay not leaning against the wall okay good do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like voice okay what about your voice what should your voice do use your presentation voice yeah like a presentation voice does it sound like this what does a presentation voice sound like kind of loud but not like an outside voice yeah kind of loud but not screaming right i like how you said not an outside voice all right what else for speaking do you remember what else one of them i know didn t really have to do with speaking but it had more to do about your report and it was did your report make sense right did what you write make sense what about if i read my report really slow is that good i can t remember it starts with an f fl fluency fluency good and what does that mean you re not reading slow or too fast good not too slow not too fast just right okay so we have posture voice makes sense fluency do you remember what the last one was you re not doing it right now eye contact good all right you want to make eye contact right right so when you re reading you want to be able to do what see the people yeah look at the audience right kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people okay now if i m a good listener if i m the person sitting in the audience how can i show my classmates that i m being a good listener no distractions okay so don t distract them what else don t be distracted by someone else okay so you want to focus on the speaker all right how can you show them that you re focused on them how would they know look at them yeah look at them right okay look at the speaker and what else what about at the end when they re done ask questions good ask questions anything else sit up straight okay good could you tell them maybe how they did what do we call that like feedback what they did well on or maybe what they could do better right okay put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at what do you think you do a good job at okay you re focused on the speaker all right you sit up straight okay you don t distract others that s good okay now out of these two which one do you think you need to work on which one could you do a better job that one okay so maybe you could ask more questions at the end okay all right what about speaking which ones do you think you do a good job at already posture okay you do a good job on that one make sense mm hmm eye contact mm hmm okay so out of your voice and fluency which one do you think you could do better which one could you work on the voice voice all right so what do you think you need to do better with your voice speak up louder speak up louder maybe a little bit closer to like that presentation voice okay on your rubric it was what five four three two one do you remember what you got on your volume three a three okay so miss welch thought you could do a little better too so maybe next time you could get a four or a five okay so we have been talking about famous african americans and you had said that walter payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting right all right so we are going to look at some information about walter payton and then see if we can maybe do better on asking questions and maybe working on your volume okay cool okay so austin the other day you and i met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about walter payton and the first one was i was speaking and you were videotaping me and then we flipped it and i videotaped you so what i want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out and then we re going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future okay so we looked up some facts about walter payton and let s watch my speech first and i want you to be thinking about while you watch me how did i do on eye contact how did i do on my volume how was my fluency did it make sense and how was my posture okay on a scale of one to five five being woo hoo miss suzer you did a great job and one meaning miss suzer i didn t even see that at all okay all right you ready all right let s see how i did walter payton was one of the best running backs in the nfl he played for the bears after going to college in mississippi sweetness has over 110 questions but he died in 1999 of liver cancer he s one of the best football players of all time i wish i could have seen him play he was my favorite football player all right so let s see what do you think do you want to use purple or blue you want to be purple okay so how do you think i did on eye contact what do you think you think a four okay why do you think a four did i give much eye contact no no oh you re saying yes i only saw myself look up once so i m going to give myself a two i don t think i did a very good job you re too nice alright how was my volume pretty good okay i think i ll agree with you there how was my fluency or my rate good okay i think i m going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where i thought maybe i could have talked a little faster i don t know all right did it make sense what i said yeah okay and how was my posture was i standing up straight looking ahead okay i wasn t like swaying or rocking or anything all right so it looks like overall i think i need to do better on eye contact and you thought i could probably do a little better on eye contact and i think i could do a little better on my fluency i think i could have maybe spoke a little bit faster it sounded like i was kind of in slow motion okay so now let s watch how you did and then we ll grade you okay all right so here you are okay let s see all right how do you think your eye contact was a one why did you give yourself a one because i didn t really look up you didn t look up at all did you were you looking at your paper what were you concentrating on paper the paper okay yeah i would say it would be good maybe if you held your paper down at your belly button right and then you could look up all right how was your volume not evident okay i m going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you i think the reason we couldn t hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face i think your voice might have gone out a little bit more all right how was your fluency or your rate what do you think i didn t hear myself at all okay all right i thought it wasn t bad at all i thought it was pretty good because when i could hear you i thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four you weren t reading really fast you were reading so that i could understand you it was just kind of hard to hear all right do you think your facts made sense why did you give yourself a two i don t know i had some in there and i don t know all right because you could only hear parts of it you think if your volume had been better you could have heard more okay all right i m going to give you a four because i think it made sense all right what about your posture how was your posture man you re being hard on yourself why did you give yourself a one because i wasn t i was like wiggling around a little bit yeah okay well i m not going to be that hard i m going to give you a three okay so if we were going to do this again maybe in front of your class or in front of your teacher or something what would you do differently next time now that you ve seen yourself what would you do differently maybe the things you got ones on right okay so maybe looking up over your paper maybe your volume yep maybe working on your fluency or your rate maybe a little faster right what about your posture what would you do differently stand straight okay try to stand still all right so it looks like we have a couple things we could work on right for next time okay sounds good,0.0
that one hurts it says volume by use the formula to find the volume okay so i got 53 when i added up the numbers yeah i did too i took it and divided by three 17 6666 just do 17 6 no 17 point three sixes so we ll just just no hayden we have to find 17 666 cause all six of them put 17 6 i know but we are now let s just round it up one to 18 okay yeah so with average it s 18 okay so now we have to do based on our average how close were you to your guess so how close were we to our guesses so like i was close by seven i was close by nine we have 18 here how far was nine and 18 i don t know nine nine plus nine is 18 right oh yeah so write nine right here i was by five okay all right based on our average how many drops would it take to make one liter 18 000 what oh yeah you got us correct a few times multiply it by if we had it to drops times 1000 cause that s how many milliliters are in a liter we get 10 000 okay so now we do water disposal follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid so first we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter so we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this so giselle you wanna do that no okay that yeah pour it so this gets to 20 okay i ll pour it then oops whoa okay try not to put too much i ll pour it out let s try again it with a dropper no you re supposed to do it with a beaker i know but if we re really really close and we can t do it with a beaker then we re gonna have to do it with a dropper so we just do this okay we re at 20 i think that s 20 we re at 19 i got it okay just don t drop it too fast cause i okay okay so now we have to add the three marbles so we ll bring em on this side yeah you have one hayden has one and i have one no let alina have one you do alina poured the water so it s you amy and hayden okay okay so we have to like tilt it to roll down the cylinder i think i can do it yeah i know but it s the easiest way no not that much you don t wanna don t wanna pour some out sayonara sucker okay the water level now is 26 exactly all right so it went from 20 to 26 so the difference in volume is six and the volume of the three marbles is six right what do you think alina yeah how do you think i got six i don t know well subtracted 20 from 26 because it s 20 before the marbles and 26 after so the marbles must be okay kay how we doin over here pretty good all right i m gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume what have you learned about volume so far whenever you alina look at the board that i made for you okay whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder what s happening to the volume what happened what happened to the volume of the water it was at 20 and then 26 it got higher it went higher it went higher okay so we can say then that volume does what what did it do rise it rose okay volume rises okay so the volume rose good and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement did you get that far yet yep okay we got six because the water was at 20 before and then after we put the marbles in it was at 26 so it s six cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20 good okay if you can switch places with me i wanna be able to hear alina okay all right so i m gonna ask you another question when you were doing if you got six if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have we need to change that to a solid measurement okay this is the solid measurement cubes that we use to measure solids marbles are solids so alina can you can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes to centimeter cubes each one of those is a gram and if each one of these is a gram that s correct and if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed and all and in that case it must also be equal to one gram so that s why for this i wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams i could also figure out that these are our three marbles and we have six grams then each one of them is 15 grams okay but grams is that a unit of volume or is that a unit of mass mass mass good alina it s a unit of mass so what hayden said is correct one centimeter one milliliter is equal to one gram one milliliter of water is equal to one gram but what do we know about the cubic centimeters we need to put the units in this term so if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles then how can we change it to centimeters cubed how many milliliters is this is one centimeter cubed do you remember one it s a one to one ratio like eli told us in home room so six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed so and this is the unit of volume but you re also right the mass must be it will also be equal to one gram but we re talking about volume not mass so it s the weight it s the volume yeah it has to do with three times three times four but you have to explain why because so how do we know this but why do we do that you don t know the answer right now because it said that three cubic centimeters and a height of three cubic centimeters i don t know if that s really a three with a height of four yeah with a height of four so we have to do our work cause we built the work right there and like height from a and the height hold on so so summer three times three and then yeah times four i m up to three times three that s nine and then times four gives you three times when i did this it was four times three i know that is so three times 16 no three times three is nine times four is okay it s three times four okay it s nine times four why would that be 60 36 yeah so we did three times three we calculated nine times three so that gives you nine and then because there s a height of three you multiply by four which gives you 36 because it s a basic math problem and it gives you 36 okay so explain why you know that and then and then we go on to number two but wait for her to finish i am i m just gonna be a little change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try and it and explain of course not because we re gonna feel like i think is something s wrong well we can well i guess if no we can t cause you can take that one off the building height no we could tip this over this way and solve for why would you do that what we re done with problem one so now so i guess we could yeah but no but in we d still have we would still have the same volume all right so the next problem is can you change summer are you still i m fine i know but we already read it though she can read she needs to read it ryan so what say we couldn t because the numbers we ll have to do the oh wait no no we could no because like we won t we re doing the height and we turn it sideways yes we would it s true okay so so how are you guys doing for number two we wanted to we had it like this and we wanted to turn it sideways cause that would change the height around okay so let s talk about number two that s the one you re on i m completely knocked it over all right so the question is on number two can you change the length width can you change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try it and explain okay so first of all the first rectangular prism you built so this rectangular prism okay was one centimeter i mean three centimeters long we did three times three it was nine because it had a line so three times three is nine then times four times height of four i don t know okay so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one correct okay and then you just multiply its length times its width times its height and what did you get summer i got 36 36 and i m thinking that more than one thing can equal 36 like if we had okay so how many cubes did you use to get this two for 36 this 36 how many cubes were there in all in all that was 36 it was 36 you had to count out the cubes right so can you use the same but have like a different height but have a different length width and height well yeah the answer would be yes because more there are multiple pieces you could do six like well you do two three and six okay two times three equals six six times six equals 36 two times three times six would equal 36 right as long as the three would be height so six could be this okay summer what do you think they think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes could you still use 36 cubes build a rectangular prism and but get different numbers here you can why do you think so because it has to change it from then like the 36 would still be the same,0.0
anything else so what composter would you want i think we would want maybe like a three tray or four tray vermicomposter and i do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper maybe you guys have a different idea maybe i was thinking that maybe we can make one because i printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter so again that would save us a lot of money just to make it like this might cost 20 to get all these supplies and i know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this and this might cost 20 when a store bought one off the internet may cost 100 yes but the store bought one s are quality and a professional makes it so they know what they re doing i doesn t really matter i mean it has the same purpose it does the same thing i just matters on the worms the only thing that we really have to buy is the worms dylan and ben i got to admit i do agree with claire buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about i know it says what do we know about now where are you guys in your conversation we re deciding to do wood metal or plastic but he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust it could rust because of the moistness of the compost okay it s not metal we re not talking about metal so we might do plastic on what if we make it purchasing one no if we make our own but this one is award winning seventy dollars all right and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class this is buying a vermicomposter that would cost 70 and what did you say about yours this is about like 20 because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes and we need two of them and it says the cost is about five dollars each and that would save us a lot so we could get weebly pro tools and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags so what are your thoughts on helping the whole community i think we should build this because it s better and we would have more money left over and how would you spend the other money left over i would spend it on like stuff that we need for composting like for tools okay wait we have multiple conversations going here in this group so let s wait i would spend it on the tools weebly pro and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost and then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out and that way you could get more money and then we could get something else what s weebly pro it s like an extra you can search it up on google isn t it a website it s 26 compost and then you can have a many slides as you want videos and then we can sell our compost on the internet and that would help a lot so how is the weebly pro better than the weebly that we already have because you were the webmaster on the class website on the composting website and you want to what do you want us to do we can have buy the six month plan and then the guys for next year they figure it out and how would us buying the weebly pro help the community it would help us to sell it and to inform about compost okay any other comments or thought we could it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own okay inform who be more specific the viewers of the website all of our guests yeah there s a greater chance it s not gonna fail guys we re not playing the what if game i not saying but we have a chance that the cups might break because they re cups and they have an easier chance it has a bigger chance of not failing we have to take risks we have to plus you would have the pride of making your own if we make our own and we mess up then we re just wasting money what if what if what if what it i m not doing the what if cause remember last time when we built a if you make it there is a greater chance you will fail maybe instead of cups we use pvc pipes i mean they re that cheap and i mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups shhh too many people that s better quality i do agree with you adam but i also do agree with dylan and ben on two different subjects guys why don t we just make everything we can make the compost bin but if we make everything reusable bags why don t we buy the vermicomposter and then we make the bags the reusable bags are more like for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag and then the tools we might really need later on when we don t need the reusable bags we might need the tools or we said we might need to go buy this now and it might be too late already what s the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags jessica what s the major difference between the two in vermicomposting it keeps reproducing there s three products while the reusable bags when you sell them once and that s all you get from that bag and with the vermicomposter it keeps going it s very unlikely almost impossible that all the worms are going to die in one night plus why would you buy the bags if you can make them cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags like walmart and target bags and she melts them down and puts them into a bag why don t we buy the vermicomposter so it s a better quality and we make the bags they re easier it s very hard to find a perfect vermicomposter that s plastic and won t break most of them are terracotta and they ll shatter if somebody knocks it over it s also wood and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad how do you know we re going to do wood compost things on the internet are using either terracotta or wood terracotta shatters really easily okay so we need to do more research on this i found a four tray bin that s plastic for 89 99 but still why would we pay 100 when we can pay for quality a mere 20 i know but the materials we use aren t made for composting listen to carly for a second what carly because if we do what ben s mom s friend can do you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter do you think you could get your mom s friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does i think we should buy the vermicomposter first like buy it or make it and then buy the reusable bags so just like ben s mom s friend s bags but we should make them both because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools like a new aerator if we make the reusable bags we won t get to put our symbol on it which i think is part of the bag we re thinking about doing ovens cause it s like one two three four five six if we made it we wouldn t have a guarantee that it would work because we could screw up the way we make it or we could just mess it up in general but if we bought one it would be kind of guaranteed to work but sometimes we miss a part or a tool that we need to put it together how do you know that sometimes what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren t always there because when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools so we couldn t do one part of it and then it just all got all messed up it just threw us off so from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something we don t always get it this part is the leading thing right there it comes built all we have to do it put the plastic bars together and it will be kind of easy cause it just like goes yeah and you can work as a group to make it because it s like those styrofoams where you pull it together and you can just see where it s put together the sticks like the couplers on the sides so we have something to be proud of that we made everybody said that we wanted a see through one so we could actually see the dirt and this one s not see through so if we made our own could we get a clear tote cause the worms don t like light so you can lift to look and the worms don t like light so when you look at it lift it up look at it and then put it back down that s a good idea no one else has thought about that christian and how do you know that the worms don t like light because we looked it up on the internet and then one time i was in my house and i saw a worm out in the street and it was kind of like rattling rattling in the sun so then my sister kicked it in back in the grass so then it was much happier and i re research that okay but do we have to do vermicompost no we don t have to do it at all it s going to be our class we need to vote on what s going to be the best for the community what about reusable bags i think the reusable bags are and why how is the reusable bags different than what we re already doing if we sell the if the people next year sell them at the holiday boutique then if we sell compost then it would be the same customers and if we give the customer something different more people will come because they ll yeah and they need bags they could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy and for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag they could use the reusable bag i have an idea i think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler and then we should get the bags and we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea and then they could buy the bags and they could buy the compost and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it s not that hard so we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost yeah that s what i was thinking it s gonna cost extra and then make it just a bit more expensive cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost you know if you put your money in the bank they give you money this would basically give you money because you can make the compost yeah the interest yeah so we can get the money from this and then we can buy the bags for the high level tea but that has no holes for the worms the sun is coming right into but would it fit in our room so we need to get more information on this remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size yeah but normally they don t do false advertisement this is like in a this the bottom is like this size of a desk you could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in it s like a shower it s like the size of a shower yeah you guys need more information we need more information before you can make a decision on that a lot of information on this already but we won t make tea if this one would have really worked cause it s made you know the more it costs the better it works do you agree with his comment no yeah that s what cara said can anyone give an example i don t agree with that because when i was real little i bought some toy cars and they didn t work as well as i got some that were cheaper and the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones okay you guys continue discussing that,0.0

okay what s the next one zach jen you can put on a 50 line poem on that one here if you wanted to i got that you have okay what was the main what was the summary what would be a good summary sentence well they competed in a game known as the memoriad uh huh you guys had that one don t you you have the names and faces there that was great the game are you doing the vocab though no okay so wait hang on should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words you can just do anything from that article the pictures were just to get you thinking about it that s why we did the words and the vocab was just to help us understand so it doesn t have to go off the vocab but the vocab kind of connects with an idea so it may kind of work out that way you ll have to let zach see because you took what he had which is great and you added to it do we put the name of the movie i m doing it s a song the croak part is a song mm hmm that was part of the okay i was getting there there s the song i was stuck on the reading one too got one left zach what s the text structure sharpening his pencil just go like that so was the puppet in 1970 or was it yep 1970 that must have been old 1968 is when the yellow submarine came out yep all right do you guys want to put your pyramid up there zach do you want to help do that do you agree that he was right on the text structure yeah see if you can build it i tried to size it just about right as close as i could get so it should fit in there pretty good i don t think it s sized up very well what i just got it as close as i could zach it may not be 100 perfect and then the person that didn t read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers that means we got to do another one you each got a chance to read yeah that s the tone one we need one more detail did i make it a little too big or is it pretty close it s a little long could be a little long huh had a little extra at the bottom next time i ll shrink it up just a little bit we still have one more that s fine and who read it was it zach we ll let zach read those when the girls get done okay do i read the summary do you just want me to read i don t know if he knows start with the details memoriad is an unforgettable competition memoriad games is memorize 50 line poems people compete in the games called memoriad the game is to memorize it memorize names and faces and memorize a 50 line poem very good and what was your text structure description description because they were describing all about he just talked he did the talking you did the writing somebody gave you ideas kinda maybe it was a good partnership the girls are just about done we ll let them read theirs and then we ll do our jeopardy can we tape the jeopardy game mm hmm yep we have the same people in jeopardy that were in here yes it is the same group okay let s not have a sword fight right now she has one more task there she s got it all grammatically correct okay let s just judy over here do you mind if it s off to the side there s another one there s two of them oh did it fall off well we can put a little piece of tape over it oh here it is there you go that should hold it up good all right see if you agree with what the girls have here are you listening zach got a pyramid all set up our text structure is wait do i start at the bottom start at the bottom and the details kind of add to the summary the movie they were talking about was the yellow submarine starring is it starring or staring starring i bet starring the beatles the beatles okay their song called being green was made in 1970 summary the television was made in 1953 kermit was in 1970 stoplight was made in 1920 they all had one thing in common they were in a color very good i love that last sentence they all have that in common they re in color text structure is sequence sequence because it tells the order of them all the years very good okay one of you guys go grab a marker board one from each team and i ll go get jeopardy and you ll need a marker to write on the marker board i will pull the screen down all right zach zach where are the markers you can grab one back there there s one up here as long as you got one or two for your group you can take turns now these questions i think will flow pretty well today whoa i can t even see it i think the yellow is better i know with the lights on it s a little harder but it helps to have the lights on did we run review what did we run review text structure my music didn t come on confucius says vocab text features features thank you zach yes they re different confucius says yeah okay who started first last time was it the guys yeah okay we ll let the gals start today so do i do text structure oh you re gonna win text structure 500 text structure 500 yeah what s the confucius says we had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit they were little sayings and you decide just which text structure they go with so that might go with text structure yes it ll be a text structure question yeah is that what you guys wanted was text structure right yeah okay in our state dams have been built zach on many rivers these dams are used to product electricity we need but they also create problems scoot your chair closer to your partner scoot your chair back prevents the other wildlife near the rivers therefore we should not build any more dams instead we should use solar energy or energy from the sun to produce electricity this will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us hmm which of the five text structures we think it s problem solution problem solution correct give yourself 500 points because it said problem in there all right what would the guys like hey sorry zach what do you want they did text structure 500 it ll pop up yellow after i click on the next one vocab for 500 vocab for 500 want to read that one zach you should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response hmm what does ponder mean you think ahh perfect to think about give yourself 500 points all right what would the gals like should we try the confucius question yeah for 500 okay confucius says for 500 and marissa can read this one confucius says a beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes this is one of the five text structures description yeah description description very good and i ll just set these out i got something that might help you guys since a lot of these have them you just kind of have your choices right there what would the guys like very good text features text features 500 text features 500 which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects people and places you find in a book index table of contents title what do you guys think alphabetical listing what do you think zach index index index would be correct good job guys what would the gals like oh 500 yeah i just did that 500 should we text features for 400 400 okay all right judy can read this one what text feature gives definition for vocabulary words wait what is it wait yeah what do you mean for that oh i didn t that one doesn t have the choices like the other one did it would be an index a glossary or a title glossary glossary is correct i put the choices on the other ones i just must have missed that one very good all right confucius says for 400 confucius says for 400 could you go for mrs lloyd s for just a couple minutes okay i wanna go tell mr debush that s all right i ll just get you guys a pass here in just a second we ll do a couple more questions here all right whose turn to read it s zach s zach s turn okay confucius say first feed the lion then enter cage hmm sequence sequence do you agree with him yeah yes very good sequence all right what would the gals like what one did they do they just did the confucius says for 400 i want to do that one for 400 or for 300 right i think yeah confucius says 300 okay yeah okay all right oh man basketball whose turn to read confucius says net in soccer is much larger than net in basketball compare and yeah compare and contrast very good all right so they did this one zach what would you guys like you want to do vocab for 400 vocab for 400 yeah vocab vocab for 400 okay many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs very good just a second what do you think first players okay the first players you re exactly right oh my gosh people who have done something for the first time and they don t get paid they re amateurs all right what would the gals like they did vocab structure yeah structure 400 yeah they want the big point ones is it my turn yeah i think so living in the country is very different than living in the city a city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people in the country there are fewer cars and people in the city many people can walk to the movies stores and other activities in the country people must drive to get to places compare and contrast yeah compare and contrast and she agrees very good all right what would the guys like what do you want zach vocab for 300 vocab for 300 oh it s your turn zach i depleted my savings when i bought my new basketball shoes what do you think hmm what do you think one for depleted oh i know this one drained drained yep empty gone you used all your savings and basketball shoes can cost a lot of money so i can see that happening what would the gals like confucius oh wait no no no did they do text structure 300 nope he just did the vocab okay i want to do text structure for 300 features for 300 no text structure oh text structure i can go back structure for 300 the eye is made up of many parts the white part of the eye is called the sclera sclera and the colored part is called the iris the iris comes in many colors including brown blue green and hazel the iris is covered with the cornea which is clear and round description do you agree yeah i should know about the eye because my stepmom s a she works at the eye company wait did we just pass text features oh she does they just,0.0
our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column what i learned in the kwl chart okay so that s our goal our goal is to find the answers to draw a conclusion to our month long experiment before we do that why don t we take another measurement i would like you to measure your plant if you have any and i would like you to count the number of leaves on your plant on one of them go ahead scientists take your ruler take your ruler and measure i like the way some of you are holding your rulers it s great that you put the lower number down when you measure great if it helps you can pick up your plant okay after you have your measurement and the number of leaves make sure you count the numbers the leaves too you may put your plant down after you put your plant down i know you are ready to continue could you touch your head with your empty hands good job john touch your head with your empty hands wonderful i see that you re ready right katie put your hands down i also took pictures of your experiment your pictures will serve as data that means the information you collected this group picture were from the people who conducted the experiment to see if seeds would grow with soil water and sunlight sunlight we have air all around us so we all have air i would like you to use good listening ears day one day 11 that s what it looked like day 18 day 24 and day 32 we even have a ruler here a primary ruler that s easy for kindergartners to use now looking at the data and your pictures what do you think the conclusion is if you did this experiment if you planted the seeds you planted your seeds with soil water and sunlight could you please raise your hand good we have some eager participants could you please come up here with your experiment and a ruler and explain to us my experiment was if plants will grow with sun soil and water and i put them near the windowsill why did you put your cup near the windowsill to get some sunlight so your seeds received sunlight did you water your seeds yes i did okay and you did put soil yes in the cup okay what do you think your conclusion is if plants will grow in sun soil and water and what is your answer um did your seeds grow yes did you take a measurement yeah may we see how tall they are how tall are they one inch did you see how kieran measured his plants he has the end with the lower number touching the base of the plant that s good scientist now how many leaves do you have on some of them four leaves and how many did you have last week two two so what do you think is happening they re growing they re growing because you have more leaves wonderful great job scientist and now let s look at the next experiment boys and girls this one is planting seeds without water did seeds or plants grow without water i would like you to look at the data this is your data just in case you don t remember sometimes we don t remember what we did but pictures help us day one day 11 day 18 day 24 day 32 hmmm i wonder what the conclusion is oh john you want to come up and share great take your experiment and your ruler and i really love the way thalia listened my experiment was if plants will grow without water and i put sun soil i gave it sun and i put soil and i never gave it water how did you give it sunlight i put it by the windowsill okay so what is your conclusion my conclusion is plants will grow without water will grow or won t grow won t grow very good thank you thank you very much young scientist great job and let s look at the next experiment did seeds grow without soil here s day one again scientists look at the smart board day 11 day 18 and day 32 now who did this experiment we would like you come on up rachel bring up your experiment and tell us all about it i did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil and i put seeds water in it and i put it by the window and i gave it sun and they didn t grow what did you not use soil you did not use soil and where are your seeds by the window they re in your cup right now in my cup uh huh would you mind showing the class what you have there tilt it down boys and girls take a peek this is what rachel s seeds i can t see okay so now what is your conclusion rachel seeds won t grow without soil very good thank you scientist we have nothing to measure in rachel s cup and the last one oh boys and girls this is a very interesting one i really would like you to look up here look at the data first did seeds or plants grow without sunlight a lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight but look at this one day one do you have anything no no day 11 no day 18 look at the number look at the numbers on the ruler day 24 i want you to look at your data and day 32 well that s some interesting experiment i know some of you did this one quite a number of children if you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like come on up okay john you re going to show juliana what a good listener you are okay go ahead buddy i planted seeds without sun and i put them in the closet did you cover your seeds with soil yes so your seeds have soil soil you watered them watered them every week you watered them and and no sun and you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in the closet in the closet and the closet has no sun has no sunlight it has no windows right john now juliana tell the class if you ever had any sprouts i did have sprouts and what do you think happened they died how tall were your sprouts at one point one inch one inch and why do you think they died because they had no sun and do you think the sun is important for plants to grow so what is your conclusion no seeds won t grow without sun very good good job scientist you may go back now boys and girls i m going to ask you to think about your experiment think about what your question was what you wanted to find out and the steps you took to do your experiment and you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out you may say what was your question or what do you want to find out and here s a big question mark and after your partner answers then you may ask what did you do what steps did you take and at the end we will like you to ask your partner what is your answer how did you know that s the answer they have to tell you their evidence what they used to tell you the answer okay now turn to your partner and talk to each other remember how we work as partners what did you find out what was your question my question was take turns gabby take turns boys and girls let s take 30 more seconds if you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free okay boys and girls turn around please put your hands on your lap so i can see your empty hands alright let s look at the answers again our whole experiment and let s look at the questions will seeds grow without water what do you think no if you don t think seeds will grow without water shake your head great cameron will seeds grow without water no no good okay next question will seeds grow without sunlight no let me see you touch your ears if you don t think seeds will grow without sunlight okay let s see will they cameron no touch your ears so i know you understand next one will seeds grow without soil yes or no yes no will seeds grow without soil no no touch the ground touch the rug okay great the last question katie is will seeds grow with water sun and soil yes good then make some rain drops make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil,0.0
tyler pushed the ball okay well how does that how does that affect the ball it makes it go faster and make it fall so why is that a problem because she ran because she because she pushed it i know but why is it a problem that she pushed it because it goes faster and that s a problem because because why she didn t win oh what do you mean win she win the game oh did you all make a game out of it uh uh we didn t turn a game into it okay well what are you doing then he s playing a game what are you doing kylie he s rolling and see not playing a game just rolling and seeing where they go wait a minute what rolling them to see what how many sticks it takes so did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one taking turns oh okay so do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them not push them so is that what you re saying it wouldn t be fair if she pushes hers but no one else pushes theirs because pushing makes it go faster you said okay alright so it makes it what makes it go farther okay alright so do you wanna do you want was anybody else pushing theirs rebekah okay do you want rebekah and kylie to do theirs over again alright show them how you and todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same now i guess i m gonna have to get our ball i need ball number two we need a captain miss henderson can i be the captain we don t need a captain you re all doing what you re being what we re not being captain s we re being what scientists scientists so work together wait don t pick up her ball she hasn t measured it yet five six seven eight nine 10 11 21 sticks where is 21 you looking for it on the hundreds chart are you looking for it on the calendar you can get up and point to it i got 18 sticks for my ball i can t find it anywhere 18 sticks i m going to see how many sticks i got for my ball okay how would you find 21 on the chart i don t know where could you start by one okay 20 oh you found it do you need more sticks honey 17 yes okay go ask another group can you borrow some sticks another ball 12 so it takes half of 14 because she said no i m using it and she and i said i have a idea and she said no what was your idea john i was just trying do it on my head like on my back of my head then down use your head as a ramp uh huh and where did you have the ball hun in her pocket the whole time why em does the ball belong to you or to the group group so if you re not using it should you let someone else in the group use it okay go ahead roll it on my back and now roll it if it does it right here no i mean like right here where do you want them to where do you want them to start the ball i think is what they re asking in my head somewhere like right here because a ramp starts where on the top up high and goes down so if you re using his head i would lay like this oh did that work yeah what do we do with it after we do our balls okay you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we re gonna clean up in just a second put your name at the top of your paper please we used it on this one you re supposed to do all four of the balls ball number one ball number two ball number three ball number four we would do ball number three number one is this one how about number one but this one which number is that one so get number three we ll have a race and we ll so what are you all doing with the ramp now we re putting it on the chair and whoever gets it whoever gets down to the bottom first we were actually gonna roll off it well why won t it roll off that ramp because why what stops it the block the block stops it okay so how much does it go try the little one whoever is in front of me move i got 10 miss henderson everybody is taking our balls okay guys i would like for you to clean up your things please i saw some great science learning science work put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug put your paper at your seat quickly let s see how quickly we can clean up id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you ve learned john you have to put everything back in your basket buddy all the sticks and balls please and then you may put your basket on the art table thank you to everybody who s moving quickly thank you to everybody who s moving quickly okay let s come to the rug and let s share some things that you learned today move that way please i said put your paper at your seat for now miss henderson braxton said this isn t whistling okay well we re not gonna debate whistling right now okay thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug okay i would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today tell us something you did something you figured out bryson if you push the ball it goes farther if you don t push the ball it goes not farther okay alright who else learned something else through their science work john that when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes and then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn t get to the stick then it gets farther and and we tried whoever gets to the stick it goes it s the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest okay the green okay todd what s something you learned today through your science work if you push it it ll go farther and that s it okay alright anything else we haven t mentioned eli there s a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it it will go past it if you make a ball if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop so the block stopped it sometimes yes sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it yeah but sometimes it stopped it okay grayson well sometimes what i did was i kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then i was rolling this big ball and once it hit it it kinda like jumped up in the air and went harleigh and moved in and for like three blocks for three sticks okay preston what did you learn today if you like if your hand go fast the ball goes fast if your hand goes slow the ball goes slow if your hand goes fast what do you mean by if your hand goes fast like if you re at the bottom and and you do that and go like that it goes fast what is that called that you re doing pushing the thing so if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow it goes slow the force interesting the force of pushing okay chloe i learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes when you lay what diagonal what is it called again what a diagonal line when you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster what is she talking about eli the what she s talking about a ramp oh the ramp when you lay the ramp diagonal uh huh the ball goes fast when you lay it straight it doesn t go fast it just sits there oh so if it s if it s less if it s a lower ramp it goes less if it s a higher diagonal ramp you re talking about then it goes farther interesting brody we tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that so you made you made ramps with your bodies so did it go,0.0
what it s a dark color so what does that mean we think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster keegan how are you going to figure out how much it weighs maybe it will melt faster because the water what about that explain your thinking because you ve stolen her even now we got to count it one two no now you re taking them all three we got to count four five six here seven eight nine 10 11 12 freeze for just one second let s switch and have the boys keep on you stopped at 20 boys finish counting they stopped at 20 finish counting 21 22 23 24 but they re not counting they re just putting it in it s not working they re just putting it in in the same time so freeze gentlemen so how do you think you could fix that put it back in you might want to try to remeasure definitely want to miss t look guys we need to take a bunch of it out because it s not really getting weighed you might need to use something heavier oh remember you re not supposed to touch that nob on the back that s not how you how would you figure out how to weigh it what happened what s going on daniel tell me what the problem is it has too much oh sorry it has too much water in it yeah well can we change that scientists no what can we change we can take out a lot it s too heavy it was reaching on that side six halves this is heavier wait say that again brayden what did i just hear you say i said it s heavier this is heavier than the blocks so we put more in oh yeah we re going to put more in oh way too much way too much whoa look uh uh ms teacher ms t i think it s six and a half what is six and a half the measure oh is that your predication that s your what that s my hypothesis oh how are you going to find out if it s true what do we do can you maybe explain to teagan what she needs to do just balance it they re like working on it there we go got it got it daniel what were you saying we were going to like we just figured out how much blocks it weighs hang on it ll get there so what did you discover we discovered we had we discovered we had to take we had to take one two three four of the blocks out five five of the blocks out to make it weigh so how much does it weigh so let me count the blocks one two three four do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn t fall five six seven eight nine ten how many does it weigh okay i ll start wearing this i mean i ll start writing it no i got it what are you doing there abigail well i m weighing and it s not showing up yet what are you using that tool for what tool this tool to see how cold it is so did you already weigh it we have to hold it from the top oh so do you think it s going to weigh more now that you taped that to it what s your prediction with that do you have a prediction i have a prediction that it might be really cold and that s going to tell you that but have you weighed yours yet no and it s going to turn to ice so but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it ll change how much it weighs i think it will actually change how much it weighs can you explain your thinking because because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much one pound it was so we should probably get the thermometer one pound so we can so we can so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on my hypothesis is it s going to be 20 degrees my hypothesis is this is going to change it because it s only one pound oh so what are you going to do to test that weigh it okay put it here put it here oh are you guys discussing what are you guys discussing where we are going to put our balloons so first talk to me about your balloon why did you choose this color because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster we will think it will melt slower we think it will melt slower why because because it s a light color the sun is attracted to the dark colors so that s why we picked pink so what are you doing right now doing a hypothesis oh can you explain what s your hypothesis teagan it will be warm because we re going to put it next to the heater that s what i was going to say too and so what s your hypothesis how will that change the balloon because maybe you said we re going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we ll put it in the heater and we think it ll melt faster okay what about us it s almost in the middle take out one more now i m going to count what were you guys just doing down there she was thinking about the weight what does that mean like in the middle okay so how will you figure out how much it weighs we need to take this out and we ll count them and then we ll write it on the paper 32 32 12 13 14 brayden brayden hi hayden is there any group that s measuring the length of their s 28 29 30 31 32 almost there 43 44 45 46 47 it s there it s there what does that mean so it means that they weigh the same thing okay now we have to count them let s let will only do it two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 64 64 teagan be working in your group 23 24 25 i measured my balloon by using tiles like tiles when i measured it tiles what should we do now mrs t my balloon is filled with matter why do you say that because everything is matter well there s water inside the balloon so it s like solid and liquid why is it solid and liquid what were you saying what were you saying no keep explaining your thinking i have a question one second water is a liquid and pushes on the weight oh so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis light turns into water solids and liquids my hypothesis is my hypothesis is if we like if we if we lose the like point it will not melt faster why it s a darker color and when you think about it dark colors will melt faster on their own is that cubes the has the cubes no that s the weight pass it on have you all measured yours yet yes how d you measure it with the tape thingy would you mind showing me what you decide to do my hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we re putting it by the sun did you make a hypothesis by the length of it no ours was six and a half inches how do you know because we measured it with the measuring tape can you show me how you did it oh there s an extra one will did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now these have bigger numbers you know so what are you thinking there abigail i m thinking that not really but what were you saying there with the bigger numbers i didn t understand you held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers i mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell 30 30 30 he should start now so how big is your balloon we got to start at one oh why did you change it julia from your first measurement because we accidentally started from the 30 oh and now we have it upside down okay you got it it was it is move your finger for me it is now let s send this back here okay i think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off yeah yeah i ll hold the thermometer i m trying to take it off my hypothesis is it s going to be warm but then not attracted to the light cold water is in there because sunlight can only make warmth right,0.0
anybody tell me how much cases usually run at radio shack they re 30 dollars okay you know what so we ll factor that in in a minute but alex you had your hand raised so i d like to hear from you i was just gonna say that the 199 tax is gonna come in anyway so what if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping okay hold up cynthia but even though even though if you use 12 you re only gonna have a couple dollars left over with the economy these days things are not cheap so you can t buy something with five dollars you re not gonna get a case for that cheap that s probably right i m gonna hear two more of you and then i have something i wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about and i think is really important to point out so i wanna hear what you two have to say and then i m gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned go ahead it s better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to then you d still have zero dollars left but it s better to have equal or more money okay that s you know i think you re right that seems like it just makes sense right and one more yeah actually when i bought my phone i got a case just for about five dollars on ebay ebay so you got a used one and it paid for shipping so i didn t yes i did okay well you know what i wanna talk about that because that s actually what you guys just said is really important and several of you others mentioned it maybe we don t want maybe i don t want to have the exactly the price maybe i want to have at least and if i say i wanna have at least 200 dollars is there a way to say at least with math symbols to make that equation change so it says least cause right now it says equal is there a way to do it so it says at least colin if you you need to get the iphone and the case in the same shipping order or else it s gonna cost more for shipping oh okay so yeah i need at least a certain amount yeah so you re gonna wanna jump in on that guys you need to put the greater than or equal to sign but what does that look like the greater than sign with a line under it okay and what s the word in english that we have for that symbol yeah say it again alexis that least it is so now how much do i need to save to get at least 200 dollars right so it s okay if i have exactly or more than so that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about maybe i need more money if she wants more more than just a phone i m sure she does right with the what about the just come with the phone just that or does it come with something else like a charger battery or even a case itself so again you re saying i need at least 200 dollars right depending on what comes with the phone like a christmas special like half off or something what you can also think is where you gonna buy it and where is there s no tax and stuff so it depends on where you re gonna buy it if you want no tax that means like on ebay or something but it might be 50 percent off and stuff like that okay interesting i m just saying it depends where you re gonna buy your phone okay no i like that a lot when i was doing my equation i got 121 so you would still have a dollar left over and you know how cassidy said that she can get it on ebay that much most people they i understand that it s cheap and most people want it like that but i bought stuff off the line before and some of the stuff does work good and some of em you drop them and it breaks so it s not always good somethin to pay attention to all right i m gonna change the conversation a little bit because i think you guys are doing really really well let s go with what you guys said and say i need at least 200 dollars if that s true is there any way to find out or to answer the original question which nick brought up how much money do i need to save each day based on what we have so far where do i go from here there is a way to solve it you grab 200 dollars and then you subtract 80 from it okay i m gonna stop you right there i don t mean to interrupt katherine you re watching this and i saw your paper what do you think about what najeem just said like okay and why is that i don t know that s how you solve it in equality okay so can you repeat what you said you subtract 80 from both sides okay i m gonna go ahead and do that right now and what does that leave us with 120 and you know what i have a question what does that 120 represent i mean if 200 is how much the phone costs what s 120 about i m not sure how much you need to raise until then okay okay and nayanna can you comment on what you think might be the next step divide 12 from 120 again divide 12 from 120 okay and somebody else jump in the answer was the answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10 okay and katie you were ready to say something what would you say i was about to say equals 10 x equals 10 and x equals at least 10 oh it was so you re not liking what i wrote over here alexis at least cause you have to keep the all the way down okay katherine what do you think i agree with alexis because it can t just like change because when you say it can t change what do you mean the side oh okay that s good i didn t know what it was i m just asking and then you have to put what x means oh oh oh so what is the label what are the units we re talkin about ah the blue tooth if you wanna have a little extra money you could have more and plus if you get a little extra money one day but you have the same another and you get a little less the next day you could raise up for another day oh like if i m going to collect cans and i don t collect as many cans one day but i collect extra the next day yeah like that nayanna you had your hand raised when you have to add 40 to 200 for the bluetooth ah that s an interesting idea so maybe we so tell me what to write instead of this how would you change this to incorporate what you just said 80 plus x equals 240 okay are you pleased are you okay with that i disagree cynthia i disagree with your answer on that one i don t agree that it s 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money you would you should you should do 11 for a day because if you do you ll get 132 and then you ll have extra money okay but that s the problem what do you mean when you say it s not asking well it s not asking for extra money or anything it s just asking how many how much money you need per day anthony i noticed you ve got some stuff written down what do you think about i wanna go back to what nayanna said she says she s gonna change the equation here and she put 240 up there why why did she do that and do you agree with that yeah cause then you would have a little extra money left a little bit you would have a little bit of extra money left okay like the bluetooth in the case maybe okay isn t this another problem another problem not a part of this one yet yeah cause they re not asking how much extra money do you need this problem this question s not asking how much extra do you need for a bluetooth also okay how much are the phone and bluetooth it s just asking for the phone okay i think because the question wasn t asking to bring extra money into it we just brought the extra money to round the make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay but we shouldn t change the equation cause it s not asking you to okay this question isn t saying anything about case or a bluetooth yet it s a yes question and this question talks about bluetooth okay so what i kinda like is you guys were doin this problem and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem which is no problem at all let s jump ahead just for a minute and assume that i did want to get the bluetooth would this be the equation to represent and before i answer this question what i would like to do i m gonna call on olivia and then i m gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co pilots and the pilots come up but not yet let s hear what olivia has to say would it be equals 12 x if you wanted to get it before christmas or would it be after one more time i could barely hear ya would we still get that before christmas or would it be after before before so would it be 12 comments on that i agree with that thumbs up if you think 12 thumbs down if you think no we don t need 12 on this one okay adrian you have something we need to know how much money you earned each day well that s what do you guys think about that question well that s what we re finding out right now i know but how much you earn that s how much he has to save pilots switch with somebody in the back all right here we go so now i have a question for you can everybody turn around for just a minute please thank you question for you if i wanted to graph our first solution on a number line what might that graph look like so will you guys agree that okay we need to earn a minimum amount and at least 10 dollars a day but if i wanted to graph that put that on a number line represent that graphically what would that look like it would be like a it would be but the circle what kind of circle i didn t hear you shaded so you want to put this up here yeah amarra i d like to hear your opinion on that i don t i never understood the shaded thing i don t know why it s shaded it s shaded because it s not i think if it s not shaded it means greater than i mean greater or less than but when it s shaded i think it means equal to or less than or with okay tara do you wanna contribute to that well whenever it says greater than or equal to the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to or greater than which is over 10 but greater than or less than can t be that number so it has to be open circle and than greater than or equal to anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle unshaded circle in real life what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle go ahead al fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils a little louder i got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils so in that problem could 14 students have mechanical pencils if you have fewer than 14 no so that would be unshaded cause 14 doesn t count so in this question amarra the least number of money i should save per day is how much i think 10 is a good answer because it does go into the number and so would be shaded or unshaded shaded oh is that the only number amount of money i should save each day is that it are their other possibilities out yeah you could do,0.0
