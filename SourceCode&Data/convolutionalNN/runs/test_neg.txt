 Inner circle number two Again this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we re going with this Why did the accident happen The accident of May 10th 1996 Why did it happen Any questions Yes the May 10th 1996 thank you for clarifying where everybody died well not everybody but a lot of people died Why did it happen Because Okay so I think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren t prepared for for the climb They thought it was going to be they re just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn t expect the challenges that they were going to face I agree They probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park Turns out that they weren t ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain You were talking about they weren t prepared and all that But they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn t normal And I was kind of taken aback by that because I was like if there s a guide who s going to be guiding me on a life threatening thing I would want them to be seasoned trainer you know Exactly I would think the same thing That the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew I agree with all of you but during reading the article Krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn t really anyone s fault because people were so not in their right minds They were tired and injuries and how thin the air was they couldn t breath very well So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming they didn t expect it to be as bas as it was so nobody could really prevent it Anything to add to that I agree and I think that they were just having so much fun that they weren t really paying attention I think that they would ve all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds I know you mentioned the clouds but why weren t they watching them Why do you think they weren t watching them they didn t think that they were actually serious enough to actually I agree with Matt that they were so they wanted to get to the top so much they weren t too worried about looking at the clouds Oh okay we can make it back up and make it back down maybe before Not expecting trouble along the way Yeah I agree I think that they weren t really prepared They were too wrapped up in what was going on to think about the downfall and what was happening They re tired and probably weak they didn t have safe they weren t really all there to think about what are the consequences of this and what would happen Like the guide if it were me I would have made sure they had this that you re gonna help me out more than not really being able to Anything you wanna say Krystin Well I said that this quote at the top it says that Ambition has a steep price And I think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren t too prepared and weren t qualified but I think that well and the author mentions this too that climbing this mountian is it s taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when you re putting your life on the line there s nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive it s just basically putting your life to chance and so that s what I really got out of it what do you think I agree I think that then not as many people would ve died They should just listen to what they re told and and not risk their lives to do something that I agree with that No but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and I agree but I think it s understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely cool and I would definitely want to go up there soon as possible and not worry about the weather like go all in or don t go at all I agree with lost or injured I mean but I m like half way there go ahead and accomplish what I set out to do and I think that would ve caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we re doing I agree with what Ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest I mean it says that they caught about safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life One thing I noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn t go back and check themselves and I didn t understand why they didn t go back and and like when the one guy says there s no oxygen here there s no full tanks Why didn t they go back and check that themselves I mean I would trust that person but yet again if my life on the line I would be checking it Does anyone else think the same way If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other people I d be a little weary about something like that I don t so much disagree but I came up with something a little bit different I didn t really think that people relied on each other that much at all Who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain In a way I would say that it was selfish mission but in another way I mean if it was my own life I would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think we saw that at least I saw that a lot happen throughout the story It s a choice between am I going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this does it matter Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive Some people were relying on others like at the end someone was trying to help was trying to help he tried to help her down she grabbed his arm and he tried to pull her down But she just let go and died I agree with Erin too I mean I think that right now wouldn t be able to You would think about yourself more Whenever you re out there and and you re with the same people for that long of a time and you re doing the same thing that you become sort of closer They would mean more to you then than they do right now You d be more willing to sacrifice something to survive to help them give them another chance to get out alive too That s definitely shown at the end of the article when he s talking about how he can t live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost and how he couldn t even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time I agree with Erin I think there was a lot of at the end I think he was talking about the there was a lot of blame involved and why couldn t we prevent this and it brings me back to what you guys said I think they really wanted to help each other and I think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases I thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn t prevent someone s terrible death Tyler what do you think about this Like did he grieve or even just the fact that who they were relying on Well what strikes me All right outer circle what d you notice What d you notice I noticed that people were and books and just kind of in inner circle and I felt that that really helped them to get the instructions Okay Blake what did you notice I just thought that it was more and more like Erin really led the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and I think that those were like the two main ones but like Levi and Elliot and Alex they all also communicated a lot but there wasn t just one person who was talking Okay so there were definitely two leaders but there were other people that were contributing as they went along Okay good Anthony There were some well developed conversations Well developed conversations what do you mean by that Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic Yeah did you notice what was the question they started with Yeah we got a little off topic No you didn t What what was the question you started with What caused the disaster And then you went into something totally different but did you have good conversation about that Absolutely You guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life Okay I really like how I mean it wasn t like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing Mount Everest It was definitely very connected to what you were saying Dorothy what d you notice I noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn t stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another Right it kept bouncing from one thing to another You could see like steam coming out of your ears they were all impulsive Blake I thought that also remember Erin said you re relying on someone and Krystin s like well I don t agree backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there was people who didn t Yeah Is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you Absolutely But you need to do it respectfully Like Krystin did Krystin said I don t exactly agree with you Erin then she proceeded to say Why And Levi was over here he was nodding his head and shaking yeah All right great I thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses they always had something someone would pass on to someone else They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses You guys ever heard that before It wasn t a pregnant pause it wasn t a big spacey gap okay Anthony Pretty much everyone talked Pretty much everyone talked Yeah pretty much Yeah did you notice that They built on to what other people were saying okay They agreed I still heard I agree a lot but then they told us why they agree with what they said All right Anything else you guys noticed Yes I think that we looked at our more because they had wider subject that they talked about Eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details It wasn t the whole story it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that All right Anything else 
 No I want you to swing the eighth notes Okay We re going to swing the eighth notes So remember when you swing you just make the first note longer than the second note So go like this Don t be stuck at the tip of your bells Here we go One a two a three and go Every single person here please make sure you re playing F natural Try it again Here we go One two and go Okay Now when you guys improvise you ve got to improvise off of this D dorian scale Okay So watch this If I was soloing and I was you know playing along with the music and I played this All I did was play the D dorian scale going up and down That s all it was It sounded a little fancy didn t it It really wasn t Did it sound difficult Yes It really wasn t I just did this like really changing the rhythm That s basically all I did Okay So it s really not that difficult I m gonna play some rhythms I want you guys to echo it Please sit up Thank you Nice and tall I m gonna play one measure and you re going to repeat exactly what I play We re playing this one on open D Only on open D Great now I m going to do two measures Okay Two measures and you ve got to echo it back to me This is still open D Here we go Wait for it I ll tell you when to go Excellent Okay it goes like this I m going to change it And go There it is Okay It s just four notes in the second measure So try it again And go Do this for me And go Try this I m playing D and F So the higher pitch that you hear is F natural So play this for me Great Fantastic I m only going to add one more note You want to play D F and G Okay With the exception of basses So do an open G okay So D F and G are your three notes All right get in playing position Okay So basically that s improvising I m giving you a lot of ideas for improvising Okay And you will only use three notes when you improvise D F and G You don t have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes When you improvise there are certain rules to improvising You can t just play any note because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice Okay So we don t want to play the wrong note So please make sure that you only play D F and G Do you see that tune that s on whatever page that s on for you guys There should be a page that s got solos at the top and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune You ll pick the third one with the tune Do you guys see it Yeah Okay Make sure you re on the correct side I ll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds and then I m going to have you guys play it Okay Listen to my tempo Are you guys following along Okay Play it for me Here we go Watch your rests One two and go Much better Now Good Now play it again One two and go Good I want you to play it one more time I m going to play the piano with you though All right Here we go Great Now I m going to solo for you guys and I want to show you how you can do this Okay A couple things that I did in there All I did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note That s all I did It sounds really difficult didn t it Yeah It was like whoa No I m just going I can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult You can do it too Okay So we re going to go around the room Each person is going to solo Okay Whatever musical idea you come up with Remember your notes are D F and G You got it D F and G Whatever rhythm you want to play within the rhythms I gave you So don t Okay Here we go Here s how we re going to do it We re going to start with maybe two measures We re going to start with Tessa and go around Maybe after Helen Then we go with Tallulah Priscilla listen carefully After Tallulah we re going to go around this way After Jada we re going to start with Sammy and we re going to end with Zoey Okay We re all going to start with two 
 What you just said They re going to go back together Well I ve glued them down so they can t The green and the red charts are locked down in place They can t get back but I ve taken up the orange field Wouldn t it generate a new field They re going to make a new field and that new field will be Say it again Oh like the earlier drawing We can actually say a little more than that In this vicinity here They ll be trying to pull each other back together So we re going to end up with a field that s exactly opposite What we did was they move around As long as it s still running They move apart until the field is basically nullified Let s look at one more example Do you have one more potato shape in there Most people Most people right So let s start for this last one let s look at this shape and say that I observe fields coming out like that Write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction Based on what you re seeing in there what can you say about what you see Are those lines all supposed to be straight Yeah To the best of my drawing ability they re horizontal parallel lines My drawing was perfect Mr Shields what They re going in two directions The orange Yeah the orange one Like a very large plate It could be just a potato in there and that s The thing in your hand This one Yep Okay let s take a look Chris can I get you to shut the door to keep the noise down We ll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so It s nice to have the extra period here First thing before we talk about this new one I failed to address Hannah s question and good insight earlier Yes The orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they re going to bend and will be coming outward from the positive end So you re definitely going to see this sort of pattern I think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations Anytime you ve got a conducting material Anytime you ve got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with It s a conductor So it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field Let s talk about this new one There s a couple of observations Ian give me one observation and Claire give me the second observation Besides the fact that the lines are straight No that s a good one The lines are straight Very important Claire They re going in opposite directions Exactly opposite directions Okay Hakim give me another one Well the lines are coming out of it Okay they re coming outward not inward Good To indicate that the Okay so that one we know from the very first piece here The net charge is positive The fact that they re horizontal They indicate like a plate or something Yeah is it like two parallel plates Two parallel plates So where would you draw them Above and below There are two on top So like above and below like this Four plates Four plates Let s make it 16 But if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just But what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle then it would push away on both sides Two positive plates Two plates sounds twice as good as one but I m not sure that it is Four plates sounds even more appealing An infinite number of plates sounds fantastic I m hearing good ideas here I want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios So two positive plates Okay two positive plates and I m looking at the vicinity in the middle here is that right And do I want my two positive plates to be on the sides Negative plates Well negative plates okay Two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what Bend Okay we re getting a bending because if I draw it here But you still have to compare It d be like this kind of a picture It d still be bent Greater than the distance Okay so you ve got So based on that you ve got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape What about two infinitely long Two infinitely long plates Both negative What would the field look like Forge the potato shape What would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long evenly charged negative plates Wouldn t they go If I take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle what would it do What if I release it a little bit to the left side An infinitely long plate We derived this one before a single one Remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane It s constant It s a constant exactly right Brittany didn t even have to look at her notes on that one But you remember what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate Yeah gravity on the earth here you know big flat earth I don t care how far above the ground I am it s the same number it doesn t change at all That s exactly right So an infinite plate the field is some number another identical infinite plate it nullifies it So in the same charge okay Well that isn t going to work Infinitely far Infinitely far away from each other When Brittney says it s a constant even if you go to infinity I guess it d still be a constant either that or you go to zero It would be two sets one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they re infinitely far away where Two horizontal plates like this Yeah because I don t think that s going to work either Ben you re getting agitated back there And what are you saying We were just talking You re saying there s no way in the world they can be infinite Is that what you re saying Yeah You can t have an infinite plane anything because you re defining the shape So that s a good question When I ve got the shape here do we require that the thing that I m talking about fit inside of the shape No I m going to say no Okay so does that change your answer Okay I think we can and will look at situations where the surface And remember this is all leading up to that Gaussian surface idea we mentioned on Friday Where the Gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object Like an infinite plane we need to be able to study those even though I can t fit it inside of a box So we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there An infinitely long positive plate right in the middle Right in the middle Is that what you said about seven minutes ago Yeah I tried to ignore him because I didn t want you guys to get the answer too quick But I do want to acknowledge him Yeah tell me if this makes sense and why Somebody besides John and Ian It doesn t make sense that I ve got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it s a positive plate Would it have to be infinitely long Much longer If I don t Now I m not very good at drawing in 3D so is the potato lines are they diverging this way at all I can t tell They re uniform this way parallel lines this way so we know that it has to be infinite this way And not have divergence this way Well I didn t draw any lines coming out of the Do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging That s going to change the answer that you give If I draw another red line that s coming like this that s clearly diverging from this red line So I m going to assume that every line for this problem every line that I draw is parallel and then we ll get a new Perpendicular with the plate Yeah perpendicular to the board And then all positive coming out both sides Very good Alright I ve got one more drawing on there I want to hit and then we ll just say some fantastic summary words and then I ll give you guys a break The last one here instead of the three dimensional shape now all I ve got is a single sheet of paper And this sheet of paper I ve got I noticed I noticed parallel lines arrows coming straight out of that shape Write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict based on what you observed here what and where if you want to what the source of the field lines is What can we learn from the electric field lines They re all coming out parallel in one direction Yes parallel in one direction One direction They re parallel this way and they re parallel this way also So they re normal to the surface everywhere Are they coming from the other side All I see is lines penetrating this way so I could actually draw them like this and that s fine Do you know anything about the other side of the plate like is there anything there It s a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate Oh okay Yeah they re not diverging at all Yeah uniform orthogonal all that good stuff Into the paper So they re coming out of here They re going into here and coming out here Oh okay To the differences that s a closed shape This is a two dimensional surface If I had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference right Okay guys let s see what we ve got here I m going to ask Paul first Emily second and then we ll see if Michael can go for the trifecta Oh no No pressure You can be wrong it s alright Paul what is based on your observations what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here Where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object on this sheet I think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through Where they re just passing through Yeah So then where do you think it s coming from What does that tell you about the source of the electric field I m not sure You have more to say No Emily give it a try Since it s positive on this side Yup You can see that there might be a positive charge Okay so if I had a positive charge on this side I would get electric field lines going like this That s correct okay Or if you had a negative charge Ah okay so you re answering two things which is pretty overachieving but I like it that you re saying that instead of a positive back here it could be a negative over here Okay now there s something incomplete about what you re saying The positive here versus there could be a negative here that s a great insight that it could be one or the other but Michael s going to help us out because you re a little incomplete on what you re telling us They have to be infinite Infinite Infinitely strong charge Infinitely long whatever a plane A plane yeah A plane back here that s infinitely large distributive charge that s positive That s the only way to get a uniform field here Can it work with what Emily was saying about it could be a negative over here It could be an infinitely long thing here There s one more option Does anybody It could be intro That this piece of paper here is neutral And you could just put a new positive charge But be careful Any positive charge if I start off with the very first drawing and I look at what happens when I put a sheet here the field lines are like this They re diverging I m not having divergence here at all So it can t come from any old point source We are going to assume that this thing is neutral though Okay that itself is not It s just capturing the story of what s going on Hannah Could there be both a positive and negative along the plate Yeah you can have both You bet That seems like a little bit of overkill but as long as you re making your sheet infinite in size you might as well make two infinite s You have all your infinite That s right And two parallel plates two plates that are parallel to each other one positive one negative is a very common thing So common in fact that it s on my tie today Oh yeah there it is See that Hakim do you have a question Okay so it s the positive plane that s standing or negative plane Yeah the infinite plane The infinite plane I was about to say that That it would be infinite Yeah I think Michael was saying that it would probably be Not the charge distribution the sigma how much charge per unit area will be some number but it would just keep on going on Chris Yeah you know that would be a lot Reasonably speaking if something goes to infinity all of your homework is easy So there s no purpose for me doing that What is the answer Infinity or zero It s got to be one Infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge but it s distributed infinitely far away So that s okay Now remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field And here s the thing In the first three or four examples or five I guess for some people if I take a closed surface I can learn a lot Not everything necessarily but I can learn about what s inside of that Infinitively is the first one positive Yes Yes The next one that I drew was negative absolutely This most recent closed surface it had to be a positive plate shoved in there This last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with to gauge what s happening I don t know everything We ve got a lot of ambiguity And this is why with Gauss law we need to use this closed surface We need to look at it from all sides We need to be fully envelop in what s going on or else we might miss something We ll go back again The equation that I showed you last week we ll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field Go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes 
 Today is Wednesday Yes I would clone myself Good why Why would you clone yourself Because everybody deserves a second me So you would just And I would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on Honestly What would some of the negatives to cloning something like that Well it s another me But it s still good because you know I m me and I m good and bad Do you know your clone is not going to be like set right You re gonna have to wait for it to grow up So I have to raise a little baby clone of me Yes And it ll look just like me when I was a baby Pretty much Oh that s wrong Oh my God There are so many possibilities Alright So let s start off with I ll get it a baby Raise your hand if you can remind us like what is cloning There s only one of you Like taking the DNA or like I don t know like whatever out of one person like trying to like duplicate it into another one Okay great We re all well was there only like one type of cloning What were some of the different types Well one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only and another one is let s see animal and livestock cloning Anything else you want to add to that Gady So what s one way they do the cloning So they take the DNA from one animal what do they do Do you remember what parts they used Like what kind of cell they used Nucleus They did take the nucleus And they used The eggs of the other animal Okay it s kind of interesting You can take the egg from one animal and completely change its DNA So now when that turns into a new organism it s an identical copy of the animal that it came from And if you take you can bring back endangered species too Because remember that or whatever then they put in the cow Yeah But they were like related in some kind of way so it wasn t like weird That s true It was probably a decendent Do you guys remember that from the video They had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct in fact they couldn t actually do the tests on the animal Remember they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn t even do the tests on them Right How long did last Does anyone remember Three days Yeah it was about three days right But it was the first time So when they couldn t open up that cow the cow died right I don t know that for sure but I m guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically They were Oh no I was just wondering because there s a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb That s true That does happen I mean I don t care if the cow died honestly That s another hamburger for me But that Goward That Goward That s swole You can t get any other animal like that Anybody else in here agree that it s okay to do that testing to save endangered species Well yeah because if there s like a hundred million cows and one whatever that thing was called So we should probably try and get more of them Yeah why not Okay We should clone pandas Let s hear somebody else though Is there anybody else that has I said alligator try and bring it back That s true What happens when there s so many I mean how many of you have ever watched the movie Jurassic Park Oh my God I ve seen all of them at least twice So that s a good question So if we can bring back something that looks like a cow fabulous What happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool but has bigger teeth Well you see it breaks out of the cage like in Jurassic Park the Lost World and it starts attacking all the Great Well yeah it kind of started eating people That was wrong Fabulous but what could be some of the downfalls on that Like any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct Well hardly any of the You need to The DNA might get messed up Yeah but remember that when we re messing around with the DNA yeah maybe there could be a mistake What happens then It could die It could die yes I would say One good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to That s probably what scientists are thinking Wouldn t that be great if I could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does Because a lot of things they tell you about you know dinosaurs is what they think they do Well we think they eat this and We think this is how they lived Wouldn t it be great if we could actually study those What if dinosaurs were never real Well they found skeleton remains so they re pretty much sure they were around They also found Because you can t just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive because it will mess up the chain of life Anthony has a really good point because what s going to happen if we have dinosaurs We can t just stick them somewhere for them to roam around Because they don t have anything they can naturally eat anymore And they don t have any natural predators anymore That s why you just bring back T rexes and velociraptors And what not Then you just feed them cows You don t know if they necessarily eat cows though You don t know that Well it s meat It is meat but that s also your food source Well that s not going to be Maybe eight or nine Maybe 25 for a T Rex You re underestimating the size of some of these animals But the same thing applies to actual animals instead of just dinosaurs What happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses and we re expanding our cities So we re moving into some areas where there are some animals and they start to die off because we are taking over their land So yeah we could make a hundred copies of these animals or whether it s plants or birds or certain insects But that is a good question where are they going to live if we just bring them back Wildlife park So that is a good thing And again remember that you all add because if you put them somewhere that a park they won t necessarily survive So you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that So yeah the food chain Interesting how everything s connected Raise your hand if you d like to share one of your questions from yesterday We ll start with Anthony Okay so like say me and this lady get married We both can t have kids so they take my DNA and they make a clone of me I m married to this person Would that be only my child or would that be our child And if why Maybe yeah But what if you re married Well does it require two people that has your DNA I m sorry I didn t hear you Maybe it is Maybe it s totally the environment Who s to say Maybe if you raise it and you re like This is our kid Well because of that case then there can t be any more like if we depended on cloning there woudn t be any well there d be less drama in the world because we wouldn t be doing stuff the natural way And like people being knocked up in bars and stuff and random places and stuff and like not knowing their father in life you know But you know what I m saying right Do you think it would be hard Like what if people were 100 dependent on this There would be a lot less problems Eventually if you keep cloning yourself and then your clone cloned itself and your clone clones itself You d have the same group of people You d have the best group ever Yeah but how would you know because you wouldn t be here That s dumb that s what that is That s interesting We can t have just a bunch of the same people That d be one stupid That d be dumb man I don t know Walking around seeing all the same people That s stupid You re not going be like Like the Matrix everything repeating Other questions Let s get one from a female this time We got the guys questions Let s get a girl Don t all shout out all at once Mayra what s one of your questions I said like if they clone a sheep and it s like sick wouldn t it or let s say there s a regular sheep and they clone that wouldn t the clone be sick too What did she say Not necessarily No because it s like you said it s two entire different bodies of life A lot of things can go wrong in one person So how could it just be the same thing two different Unless it s like a problem with an organ that the one had and then Well I want to say that like a disesased kid Maybe What about remember you just did genetics right If it s in your DNA what would happen If it was in your DNA It probably would get it If it was something that it caught it probably wouldn t get it That s true So it depends I guess maybe what it is Right So you have this sheep just cloned it and because it has something very serious with it and if it s genetic then yeah there s probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on I think they were showing Remember when they were doing Dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned I think they were talking about the sheep Dolly and then they had some mice that they had cloned They had said that the animals they had cloned does anyone remember what any of the side effects what they ve noticed Sometimes they can t breathe right What else Sometimes they died really young So just because it s a clone maybe we haven t quite figured it out yet Because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal if they re dying younger or having problems growing Other questions Hector what is one of your questions Or if you don t have your questions ready or you feel like your questions were answered maybe you just have a comment You have none What do you think about cloning Do you agree with it Or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it Um I agree with it Like the pros I would agree with it like for food For what Like cloning for more food Oh like the chickens Right Cloning to make more chickens Wouldn t it be great if I have a perfect chicken and I could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken I ve had all types of chickens They all taste the same That s true Everything tastes like chicken But have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick Well like a tiny little drumstick They still taste good True but what one gives you more food You got a point there Okay so maybe right But still you could put them together In the case of KFC the reason why their chicken s so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big Yes That s the way they approach that That s the best way to do that right there Not really People get cancer from that So would this be a good solution So instead of making eating our cows and feeding pigs and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones to make them larger and grow faster would it better to just take the large big cows and just clone them Or make chicken and make copies of it Yes No Does anyone see any maybe This sounds really great like we re going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat but is there any downside to that No Honestly no I don t think so Not for you Great Is there anybody else Money Money how They could cost more to but they could cost less and be more affordable which is what we want Good Money is a good issue right People won t have to think about money issues I don t think there d be a money issue if you were cloning chickens because you can always just get you know take a syringe and like But that s what he was saying that maybe it d be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff Yeah Mm hmm It would take longer What do you guys think about the cloning for body parts Can I go back to the chickens for a second Sure go for it Wouldn t there be a lot less farmers so then there d be a lot less jobs because you know like the whole That is true Like a lot of companies will go out of business because I don t know I feel like there s like a monopoly on it More private industries are going to go out of business and that s going to destroy livelihoods Because all the big livestock companies like KFC and McDonald s well they re not a livestock company they re fast food But they re going to be selling it to those right They re going to let it go off of Just by show of hands who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with That s just because you guys are okay with dying Chris not sure or does it just kind of I don t care really What was the question Oh I said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food No before that The one before Anthony started talking We were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens We ll get there I know the question We ll get there I want to say something We ll get there Alright Erica Medical the cloning the body parts like if people are sick and they need a new heart or new lungs or a new kidney Ms Scott I wrote the name of it It s called Therapeutic Cloning They refer to it that way So that s what it s called when you do that So when we re using it for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues whether it s like just a few cells or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries what do you think about that I think it s a good idea It s a good idea Do you have any reasons to be worried about that It would be better than nothing Any concerns Anybody else Have you heard of of a book called What was it called I don t think I have What s it about That s okay Levon is going to have to read it now because he ll be like What It s about like in the future will people if parents don t want their kids any more they can like they can give them a like they can take their other body parts off and they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff so they like your body parts are still alive so one arm could be like your real arm and your other arm could be like Interesting I ll have to read that book sometime Now when they re doing the therapeutic cloning they re not actually creating like a whole new human and then the body parts up There s a couple of different ways they were doing it Do you remember what they were using to how they were growing the organs That is true But what were they trying to do with the cloning How are they trying to avoid that Do you remember Does anybody remember How is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting Because Do you guys remember what happened to the woman Close Very close to that So remember when you get a body organ like the lady with the kidney right Who d she get the kidney from Her aunt Yeah so she got it from her aunt Somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family Like they were a match She had to take remember all of those pills she had to take To make sure her body doesn t like get rid of the kidney And then unfortunately it still did So they re looking at getting making kidneys and I think that they were growing them inside of a cow I think it was a cow Might have been a pig It was a big animal So you re going to grow human kidneys that are functional Mm hmm On a cow They were using another animal and they were actually growing it like not in the animal It wasn t part of the animal They were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning So on the outside of a cow there d be kidneys Underneath the skin Yep And then they would take take them out and transplant them into humans This is like that episode of South Park where it s a little bit inappropriate but not too much Then let s not go there It s a little too inappropriate then let s not Nevermind Nevermind You re going to watch it for yourself Fabulous But they are also trying by cloning because remember a lot of times they re trying to find animal parts that might match Like for example did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart So you could have a pig heart They were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts The problem is of course is it s a pig s heart which means the outside of the heart looks like pig cells So your body would know that it s not a human heart It would know that it s a pig heart And your body probably won t want that in its body So they were trying remember they had trying to grow new pigs I think they had little piglets running around The pigs had human DNA in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside So that when they keep those body parts if they put them in a human your body wouldn t recognize it as being something different Did you know they ve actually done that My dad s friend s daughter has pig intestines

 So good morning everyone Good morning Good morning today today what we have is we re going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced One was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that s required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent Okay And so we had a field trip to Wastewater Treatment Plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they re doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city So today I m going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates The overarching question is up on the board if you d like to see it It says how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws The environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city So I ll discuss the format of our debate First and that s again up on the board I will be finishing up my introduction here and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves who they represent and what their major goals are for today s debate Okay Then we ll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story so that our City Council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said So city council members please be writing your notes When we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate It s going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing Okay At the end each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today s debate Good And then as I said at the end we will have a vote City Council will vote on whether we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city Are there any questions before we begin Okay excellent And so I believe the this side had choice and so that means that Corbin and his group for representing industry will be allowed to have that closing the last closing statement today And so we ll start with Tyler and then we ll try to go back as fairly as possible back and forth So Tyler if you d like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you re here today Our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate We believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted The hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled While it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option Excellent So Corbin we re ready to hear your side and who you represent Our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate We hope to persuade the EPA and City Council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness And that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that Outstanding And so and then we will begin I guess then with Tyler who can go ahead now and you can ask your first question And we ll be looking for City Council members If you have any questions that need to be clarified statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it please raise your hand and we ll make sure that you get in immediately Okay This is so funny Okay we figure that since you say that our waters don t really need to be it already meets the standards of cleanliness but already in Colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered as the more chemicals because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry have already become endangered and extinct and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water s clean enough Okay let me ask you this Do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish We have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the EPA the standards that they re trying to enforce now Like we saw on the video this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae algae blooms start to produce So it s mostly the nitrogen phosphate that s preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe technically Okay I d like to follow this up with an article from I believe this is from the Gazette which is our Colorado Springs newspaper Since we re focusing this debate on Colorado most likely our city we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms says the writer of this article So therefore when you talk about algae blooms we don t have a problem with this So why should we be focusing on it Because the water runs off the lakes That does cause a problem with us Okay But even if we did have I mean a few Like I said again our city does not have problems with these So we can t therefore we can t focus our debate on these things because it doesn t apply to us Well that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don t have problems with algae blooms But I ve been in the mountains around our area and I ve seen many lakes ponds just completely covered with algae and scum And that so many of our local creeks Monument Valley Park and stuff are just littered with gross algae and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot And the same thing happened in the 1960s with Lake Erie and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay like we saw in the video And the same thing was happening where they said we don t need to fix it everything s fine and then just as nothing nobody did anything The lake soon was dead and it was like there s no fish in there And the water s just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes so doing nothing isn t really Okay so I m gonna interject What I m hearing is that there s a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue so I d like to hear from somebody in the City Council area who will be making a vote today How about your thoughts about the current water quality What you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently right now what level of danger are we at Have you heard a lot about this Do you feel like we are in need of serious change So we can direct the rest of the debate Okay Anybody who would like to contribute Okay Stephan Well all I know is that where we re located we re at the we re pretty much the first people that use our water and then it goes downstream for other people to use it so so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution the pollutants that we put into the water it s not it wouldn t be really affecting our city but the cities that are down the stream from us Okay but this article says that our excuse me I think I read this wrong our state does not have a problem with algae blooms Regardless of the algae problem it says without the oxygen the fish bugs and other organisms that live in the water will die and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life But that s a worst case scenario that we don t have right now and we haven t had and it s not an issue in Colorado Granted it might be an issue in like Chesapeake Bay or Lake Erie But we don t have it here it says so And multiple scientists have backed that article as well Now Corbin do you have any measurements or do you have some values that you can back that up with Not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous I tried to find some but I found So does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we Do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this Okay I would like to comment on I m sorry behind you I just called on her Oh excuse me So even if it s probable wouldn t you want to prevent it from like happening here with the algae Well if it s not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening Yeah if it happened but it hasn t happened yet Yeah but what she s saying is it might happen Yeah I mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might I mean I could say that you know an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow It might happen We don t know if it s going to happen But fish and other organisms are dying It is happening It s not necessarily just the algae but it s the future problem We ve already seen issues with the Yeah let s see what Nina has to say as far as City Council Well I just have a question wouldn t it be better to be safe than sorry _ You re right it would be better to be safe than sorry but like I said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the EPA required standards So therefore it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the EPA But we re saying that the EPA standards need to be improved Yes yes we realize that Because they re not they re too low and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams And those chemicals are getting through How would you go about doing this How would you go about stopping the pollution Because something that s important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it s something that s misconcepted is for example cars People think cars pollute the air and it exactly does pollute the air But when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it s also a pollutant Therefore industry s not the only people who are polluting the lakes It s actually U S citizens doing the same work too Okay I like that And so can you be more specific Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains Yes That may cause issues Yes Okay I ve got a whole bunch of them Alright Corbin why don t you share then what it is You want me to read all of them or just So we re not focusing just on one group There may be other groups as well but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate Go ahead Corbin Well the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he s found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants Some of those examples were railroad ties dentures and he found a live person inside of them one time So it s not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there It s you can t stop humans from putting out waste and a lot of the stuff that they re putting in there that they re actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion which some of the machines there do do are poisonous things like fluoride Which actually the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually Mason which is right up there and lead and mercury And it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion Well first of all I would like to answer Mr Dunmar s question or Mr Waz question I m sorry We do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water and it s 10 parts per million So that s just to answer that question and then to move on to yours Yes of course as you said in your own words you can t stop people from the pollution that they do cause However it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment And when we don t have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people but for also the wildlife for the economy for you know natural systems that occur within Colorado It s all you re putting it all on the line Okay let s talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water Okay Well let s talk about the costs that everybody s the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying Before you talk about cost would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying Okay I would like to comment on that That s an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution I do have a statement from the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki moon says More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war You just said from the United Nations Yeah this isn t yes we re talking about a local issue now but that is a statement that proves that Okay I would like to comment on this once more when you said United Nations that s Okay I m sorry We re going to have to go to hand raising I believe because we re getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish So Theo finish up and then Corbin will follow behind you No I made my point Okay Well like you said you do realize that s a local issue but the U N is United Nations of the world So that s not a local issue You re bringing up a fact that s from countries like Africa that don t have clean water at all nonetheless water So of course they re going to die from water poisoning but here in the United States we have the cleanest water in the world no matter where it is And Colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water if you will out of all the states Yeah because of the regulations we have in place and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water we need to restrict our regulations What are the new chemicals Yeah they ve been there for awhile We re having new problems though Can you explain it Everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous It hasn t been an issue before Why is it an issue now It has been an issue It absolutely has It has happened all over the United States Okay when we talk about nitrogen we re talking about if we restrict that we re talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here As we all know that we are we do grow many crops in our state And nitrogen mostly where it comes from is fertilizers used in that industry So to say that we re going to restrict nitrogen would be we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food Such as what What industries For fertilizers Fertilizers You can t use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have And not even lawn crops Crops lawns anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains which go into creeks which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was So shouldn t the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities We re already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into Okay so Will I hear you re saying that we re doing a lot What was learned on the field trip Specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city What role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant And how does that affect your group s goals for today s debate What are the scientists doing specifically and how does it support your side Like they said on the fieldtrip they use bacteria E coli to break down the wastewater that s in the water It s not like they re adding pollutions to it Their job is to take it out which they are trying to do By doing that they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it but they remove a lot of those afterwards It s not like to clean it 100 it s going to cost 25 billion dollars and that s just for the state of Colorado Okay let s see a City Council members I m trying to get to them quickly I m sorry Amanda behind you Stephan Where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars This is from the Gazettte The Gazette article It s from the article Science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water which is you guys s goal to restrict it it s going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all If you just want to do parts of it it s still going to be 2 46 billion dollars Which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water Wouldn t that be better tough than having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy Well I actually on the fieldtrip I asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into Fountain Creek and what we re doing for the environment and they said the water they put back into Fountain Creek is the water they get out of it It s cleaner than that Yeah So in my opinion that statement is totally absurd We re putting cleaner water for nature and nature seems to enjoy it more as I asked the chemist as well And farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops and it helps their crops grow more than Fountain Creek s streams already Excellent point Corbin Why don t we try Alexis and see what she has to say I have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy You can say a lot about the economy What do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy Well you say that 
 That s a start ok Devon and Sasha 3 1 3 what are the classifications Natural No not natural Rational Yes rational Real Yes Ok it s rational and it s real Now Brian you had first said natural Yeah I kinda because a fraction isn t natural Ok right a fraction is not natural Who else can tell us something about natural numbers then What do we know about our natural numbers They re the counting numbers Yeah Ok counting numbers what do we mean by that the counting numbers Numbers that you count with Like one two three Ok our natural numbers are our counting numbers So 3 1 3 again was just a Rational Rational and a Real Ok very good somebody else Ok go ahead Natalie Square root of 19 What are the classifications Rational Hold on one second thank you Can you show us your number So the square root of 19 Ok Irrational It s irrational I decided It s irrational Cause it s the square root of a nonperfect number Nonperfect square Nonperfect square Ok so Sasha and Christina both agree that it s irrational and Christina what else did you say I m not sure if they heard It s a nonperfect square Ok it s not a perfect square And it s also real Ok it is irrational and we wanna remember that an irrational number is also a real number even though it doesn t end or repeat How did you know without using your calculator that the square root of 19 was an irrational number It doesn t make a perfect square Ok and how do you know it doesn t make a perfect square Because I have no idea If you multiply two numbers you don t get it Ok very good that s exactly right You actually can multiply two numbers to get 19 It s just a decimal or Yeah it s an irrational decimal It s an irrational decimal ok So you can multiply and we looked at an example of that we did a little activity with the square root of 19 Is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply to get 19 Mm mmm And that s what makes it irrational Compared with if you did like the square root of 16 what two numbers can you multiply to get Four and four Four and four ok good Ok how bout another number Go ahead The classifications of 1 3 Rational and real Ok rational real Anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1 3 Mm hmm The greater the decimal it s repeating Right it s a repeating decimal It doesn t end but it does repeat Ok so if it were If it was you could get a rational number Right and that makes it a rational number very good Ok we looked at several numbers How about someone ask a question Someone wanna throw in a question Ok go ahead Scotty What integers are also whole numbers Ok what integers and let s make sure everybody s having the opportunity to answer questions Repeat that again What integers are also whole numbers Ok so what integers are also whole numbers Two can be a whole and an integer Ok what did you say first Two Ok two is an example it can be an integer and a whole number Positive numbers Positive numbers Ok our positive numbers Negative numbers could be too Can negative numbers be whole numbers though No No It can zero Ok zero Positive numbers Ok who remembers what example did I give you when we re thinking about whole numbers Pets What can help you think about whole numbers Pets Ok Sasha says pets Who can elaborate on what that means The number of pets you have Count the number of pets you have And then we asked for a number or something They wouldn t say like I have 3 4 of a dog or something Ok so if you d ask somebody how many pets they have their answers are always gonna be what A whole number A whole number which and what are our whole numbers Zero one Zero to infinity Zero through all the way Ok mm hmm Zero and all Alright good Good question Scotty Let s have another question Go ahead Luke Is a negative number rational or irrational Ok turn that around so we can see So is a negative number can it be classified as rational or irrational It would be a rational number No A negative number is a rational number It would be both Yeah It would be both If you have the square root of a negative number It s an integer Take the square root of a negative number An integer is always rational so An integer is rational And a negative number is a is rational But his question let s see that again Is a negative number so it could be rational Can we have a negative number that s irrational Can somebody give me an example of that Negative pi Ok negative pi mm hmm The negative square root of two Ok the negative square root of a number Would the negative have to be on the outside or the inside of the pi Outside The pi I mean outside the square root sign So Luke can you conclude us what was your answer to that question Sometimes both Ok it can be both Mm hmm good Alright good question too What about another number What s another number Madison go ahead The square root of 144 Ok the square root of 144 who can give us the different classifications Real Ok Damian says real Natural Natural Whole Whole Integer Yeah Integer Any others Rational Ok it s rational Do you agree Madison Yes Ok very good So we looked at when that s if we look at our graphic organizer when it starts here with natural we read this going out that it has all those different classifications Good Ok how about another number Go ahead Amy What is the difference between these two numbers The negative square root of nine and the square root of negative nine Ok I like that question So what s the difference between those two So on the first example we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign and then we see it on the inside One s real and one s not Ok Damian says one s real and one s not When it s in the inside it s not real Because you can t take the square root of a negative number Exactly we cannot take the square root of a negative number So when we see it on the inside there s not a solution to it What about when it s on the outside You can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign Ok so what would that answer be negative square root of nine Negative three Right negative three Let s talk a little bit more in depth about when that negative is inside the square root why do we not have a solution to that So it was a square root of negative nine Because you can t multiply two numbers to get a negative Right exactly So if we had like the square root of nine what two numbers can we multiply to give us Three Oh nine three and three Three and three and remember how we talked about what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number Squaring it Mm hmm So there s not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine good Alright let s have another number Go ahead Brock Ok 3 14 pi I m glad you showed that number 3 14 That is not pi It s rational and real It s irrational No it s rational It s not rational because it never ends or repeats It is rational Yeah but 3 14 ends Yes it ends It s 3 14 not pi That s not pi Pi doesn t end That one ends pi doesn t end Ok so are we all in agreement that the number pi is an irrational number that doesn t end or repeat Yes But what is Brock s number 3 14 3 14 so that number 3 14 Ends It ends So what are the classifications for that number Rational and real It s rational and real Now when we re working problems like area or circumference of a circle why do we use 3 14 Because it s easier Because it s easier Right could we use a whole number for pi to do a calculation No No way it s gonna end Right it would never end So when we re doing our calculations we use that 3 14 But Brock I m glad you had that number so you know there s that difference Pi doesn t end but just 3 14 does end Mm hmm Square root of negative 41 Ok can you show everyone your number So the square root of negative 41 Not real Ok not a real number But if it was real then and they were on the outside then it d be irrational wouldn t it Ok and why would that be irrational the square root of 41 Mm hmm no two numbers that can multiply Not the same two whole numbers Let me ask you a question about the square root of 41 What if your neighbor came and said I d like for you to help me make a fenced in area for my dog and I want it to be a square and I want the area to be 41 How would you maybe respond to your neighbor Make it 49 Ok Cause it wouldn t be a square It wouldn t be a perfect square If it was 41 Ok so you what did you say Damian To make it like 41 so you could have a seven by or 49 so you could have seven by seven Ok good Or make it a six by six 36 Ok I would tell him to make it way bigger because a dog needs a lot of space No that wouldn t actually be a very big area would it No that would be small Unless maybe it was a small dog Yes A really small dog like a teacup chihuahua Ok how about another question Oh Ok Are repeating decimals ever fractions No Yes 1 3 So you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction Yeah 1 3 Ok 2 6 It s a bunch of threes Yes Ok 1 3 definitely that was the number Damian had a bunch of threes And you said now two what about 2 6 It s repeating also Ok cause that will reduce back to what 1 3 1 3 ok Alright how about another number Ethan Square root of two Alright I don t know if you can see that but the square root of two What if you try to take the square root of two It s irrational Irrational Ok it s an irrational number but it s also a Real Real number good alright Another number that we can look at Maybe someone who s not answered Down here Nicole Five divided by zero Oh that s a good one we ve not had that How about five divided by zero It s not real That s not real Ok not a real number again Can we go a little bit further Why is that not a real number Because there s no longer a number you can multiply by it s zero Anything divided by zero is not a real number Ok I had several of you talking and I do want to hear everyone What did you say Natalie It s undefined Ok we do say that s undefined Michael could you add to that You can t divide anything by zero Ok you can t divide anything by zero And if you look on the overhead if I were to write that out and put five inside as our dividend and zero as our divisor is there a number I can multiply by zero to get five No cause anything times zero is zero So that makes it undefined Ok very good Ok another number Ooh Ooh Ok Cliff go ahead and then Brock you had your hand raised I ll come back to you The square root of 53 Ok hold that up so everyone can see Ok we have the square root of 53 Classifications for square root of 53 Irrational Irrational and Real And real very good Ok Brock how about your number Ok the square root of a prime number is always what Ok Brock s given us a question Can you repeat that again The square root of a prime number is always what Oh that s a very good question Irrational Ok so if it s a prime number and you re trying to take the square root it s always irrational Ethan you said irrational can you expand on that I said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number you have to have two for it to be a perfect square You have to have two numbers prime numbers and you have one and the number itself Ok only those two factors right Ok very good Ok maybe another question Mm hmm Is a repeating decimal rational or irrational So if it s a repeating decimal Rational Rational Yes Ok very good how about another question that we could discuss Madison True or false a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats It s false Ok it s false What does that mean Mariah if it s terminating It So if it terminates it It ends It ends right exactly Ok how about another number Anyone an example we ve not had many with integers I see you How about one with a negative number Anybody have one with a negative number Brian you do Ok I have the square root of negative 225 Not real Ok not real again why is that not a real number Because it s negative The decimal s inside Ok well not the decimal is inside but the Negative The negative s inside I wanna throw a number out How about negative 4 5 For the number negative 4 5 Rational Yeah rational Ok it s a rational number and it is a Real number Is it a negative number Yes No Yeah No Hmmm So negative 4 5 Wouldn t that be considered an integer No Because it s not a whole or a natural number Ok very good What do we know we haven t talked too much about integers What do we know about our integers How do we classify an integer That it s whole numbers and their opposites Ok whole numbers and their opposites And we used our number line in class Do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line No So what numbers are not considered integers Decimals Decimals and Fractions Ok so if they have that negative sign in front of them then what do we call em If they re not integers 
 So here s the first set I thought I d start a little bit easy So go ahead and within your groups now I ll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate how to figure out which one it is Okay Go ahead You can uh You can you use Beer s Law for this right You aren t able to taste that You aren t able to that s not big enough Our Okay so Doesn t dissociate How s the temperature Boil it Yeah that s the only way So the one with the highest concentration s going to have the highest boiling point Yeah You could freeze it and weigh it Okay freezing it The point three would have the most weight Weight Yeah But which one would freeze first Point one Point one would freeze first because there s less Okay What else Point three weighs more But we would need to freeze it first no What We wouldn t need to freeze it The first one being would be with the tasting one Or the volume one I don t know the tasting one Okay you say the tasting one you say the volume one Whichever one comes first The one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one right Okay So the one that boils the fastest Point one You could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes Alright So we can have equal volumes of each solution right And then after like a certain time Alright that s it Everybody stop Stop stop stop Okay So who want to go first We ll start with with Miles I think you had your hand up first so go ahead What s one way that you can identify these things Well you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0 3 molar 0 2 would be the middle and 0 1 would be the least Okay If they were all the same volume Ahh Yeah You guys heard that now Good Good listening skills on that If they were the same volume at the beginning alright Does everybody agree So one method is boil away and weigh Did you say weigh How do you know which one has the most I would imagine you could weigh it right You could weight it Start with equal volumes Okay There s several other ways How about Joseph If you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration Okay Anybody have comments on that Jimmy I don t think we re able to distinguish the taste that well Because our mouth isn t that sensitive Okay Miles What if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there So there s two concerns Obviously I think Miles is the most important You know you guys can see that I m smart enough to put the right substances I keep forgetting I m getting old And I may go in the back and I reach for the lead nitrate or something right And then the other part what do you guys think of the other part Could you taste the difference between a 0 2 0 3 and a 0 1 And just say Ah that s the sweetest one It s kind of hard Miles You d need some salt The problem I think is this is something we would actually need to try right I don t think this is a theoretical thing that we re trying to we re practicing theory here We would actually have to do this in a lab right I would imagine we would Wouldn t it be different for every person Because we could It could be different for every person right Because I can t see as well as you for example maybe right So there could be variations in tasting of those Ian Given excess humans Oh wait You re on the next one No on this one Alright I didn t get that either Okay so let s look at another method alright We re not going to list that one because we don t want to be tasting things Okay so Paran your group What about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0 1 would have the most and 0 3 would have the least because there s more sugar covering it What do you guys think Okay Juan He didn t say how you could measure it The way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure Everybody agree Yeah Okay So that was my concern too right How do you measure the vapor pressure You re not wrong But how do measure it And thank you Juan for bringing that up Could you repeat that Okay so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they d always be evaporating The one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0 1 molar would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time So I m going to write this as evaporation rate Who s got another method Different view Alright Jimmy Okay so you re gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light Whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Then the second one is 0 2 the last one 0 1 What do you guys think Could you repeat that So you re going to take equal amounts take it into the light make sure it s the same conditions for each one and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Second is 0 2 last is 0 1 What do you guys think I know some of you guys are thinking that s bio but you took it most of you at least right So we could finish this What do you think Wouldn t it take a long time for the algae to start growing It s going to work right Nobody sees Where s the algae You re always asking me Come one folks You think about this I m going to say the problems But I want you to tell me first alright Alright let s go with Ivan I don t think the results would be consistent Because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason So because you didn t mention how much algae you put in there could be an issue there What else though No Juan you go alright I don t think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place So I think Juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things Not just amount of sugar and amount of water There could be other nutrients is that what you re saying Yeah Nutrients and other things of that sort Could I just back up for a sec Algae produces sugar right Assuming that you re talking about algae that grows they use carbon dioxide So my hunch is there s several right One I think as Ivan pointed out you ve got to put in a certain amount Why don t you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end You picked algae so yeah Although is that a bad idea It could work but we have to be careful with conditions A lot of conditions need to be met Anything else You boil them Hold on Let these guys go If you have equal volumes and you add heat to them 0 1 should boil first Okay so you could use boiling point Elevation I wrote this down before we even discussed it But everybody agrees that works right So what s another easy one that we boiling point elevation right You need me to repeat that or you got it What immediately follows with that idea Freezing point depression Freezing point depression Okay what else I have a question for you then Could we use Beer s Law for this No Tell me why Could we use Beer s Law for this Ian you have your hand up At first glace I would say no because I do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution What do you guys think Yep Don t you need color Unless what Unless Come on keep going with this stuff Not you Ian You spoke I d like to have as many people participate as possible Alright Nick go ahead You could add food coloring possibly Yeah you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker possibly Nick we re trying to figure out the difference between these right Yeah What do you mean add You mean add a drop to each of these Yeah But then what would you be measuring The food coloring You wouldn t be measuring the sugar You know what I mean Yeah I know what you mean You re still okay with that Uh I don t know Wait Nick If you add food coloring how much One drop Yeah Okay One drop to each of these right Now they all look the same Don t they Yeah And if I stick this in my spectral photometer they should all measure the same Did I succeed in figuring out which one is which You understand that right Yeah yeah Okay Nat Could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads That s interesting Could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads You d have to indicate that high concentration would Teacher Hang on But once again we have to be careful of conditions right All the temperatures have to be the same What do you guys think Sure Why would that work Because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it s not able to spread through the molecules So that would be in the 0 3 Science Glad you like it Alright How about wait Gevorg hasn t spoken So I m thinking Gevorg it s your turn buddy What did you want to add You wanted to add a new technique Okay go ahead If we did a Benedict s Test I don t know if it would just turn the same color because I m not sure how the Benedict s reacts with different concentrations But maybe if you put the same amount of Benedict s and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test What do you guys think Benedict s is a reaction between this Benedict s stuff with sugar to show the presence of sugar What comes out of the reaction I m not sure but it s a color change Oh well the more color change But if the color change is too intense it could just be like it s all going to change that color or not see what I m saying That s what your pointing out right So again that sounds like an experimental one Could I share one more How about this You know when you take your AP test you just don t know what And we started with something that I think is sort of easy Could you use density What do you guys think Someone who hasn t talked yet Could we use density And how do we use density What do you guys think No Alright Ian Since nobody s going for it Do I have to say it Go ahead and say it Tell me how Tell us how Take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it Exactly Which one s going to weigh the most The one that has the most sugar okay If you take equal volumes this one will weigh the most This will be the most dense The more sugar you add the denser it gets You know this right Does anybody have any more Alright let s move on Set number two Now this says solid and I m trying to get you to see a different range on these Go ahead and talk about it I ll give you a minute or so Colors Conductivity We could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity Well they re solid You have to remember So solid has a lot of problems with it That s just solving it It s hard to conduct a current Well you could dissolve it It s doable It s just a little difficult Potassium Then um Wait calcium What about pH sensing So CACL2 Well they re solids Oh if you put them into a solvent Yeah Can we put them into solvents Can we make it into So lead can t dissolve in water right Lead I mean lead chloride No lead chloride will not dissolve in water But then KCL and CACL2 would They would So you can rule that out That s one way But then how do you figure out between the other solution Couldn t there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate I wouldn t say form a precipitate I would say Actually I m thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn t dissolve at all with boiling point elevation freezing point depression because you re going to have more little bits in the CACL2 than the KCL As an end result calcium chloride potassium chloride get what PBCL2 does nothing So after that if you boil it right Calcium chloride potassium the higher value Alright you guys That s it Let s gather up Okay Some of you guys just got back so you guys know what we re doing right Yes Okay Let s get it together Alright everybody stop now Christina you had your hand up first Take the easiest one What s the easiest way to distinguish these You could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest and the KCL would be the lightest Equal volumes I mean equal amounts What s an amount though Like grams But if I take equal grams then I could have ten grams of this ten grams of this ten grams of that No I didn t say that Alright what did you say then I meant like equal Equal what Volume Volume okay Now let s answer that one What do you guys think She s saying take let s say 10 milliliters 10 milliliters 10 milliliters And this one s going to weigh the most This one would weigh which one s second Oh sorry Second would be CACL2 Okay so this one would be second What do you guys think Someone other than Ian Okay Ian go ahead Does atomic weight atomic mass directly influence Listen to this Miles Does atomic mass directly influence density That s the question Does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids They re all ionic compounds And the answer to that is no You cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass that this is the most dense Okay Where just to follow that up where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works Ivan Oh wait let s give it to him Just he s just walked in Niresh Is it in gases Gases right Does everybody agree Gases you could do that If the formula mass is high on a gas then it s going to have more density Could you do that for liquids now Could you do that for liquids Ivan You could do it if it s all the same subsets for different concentrations 
 Do you know how to make a U shape like this You re gonna make the U shape with this first It s gonna make a U You re making sod homes What are sod homes Tell me what all you know about a sod home There were some homes that were dug out That were built the dugouts were in a hill okay Tell me what else you know about sod home Okay and why did they use sod to make houses Yeah okay so they didn t have trees What kind of land were they on A prairie A prairie and what is a prairie It s a flat kind of land and it never has any trees Okay okay Would you have wanted to live in a sod home I d choose a log cabin where Okay were there any good things about a sod home Um yeah What is something good about a sod home Okay what are the walls like in a sod home Are they thick are they thick walls Okay okay Did they have any furniture in their sod homes They did why didn t they have furniture JD why didn t they have furniture in their sod homes Because they weren t I think Abby do you know why they they didn t have furniture in their sod homes No but Did they bring their furniture with them No because of the wagon It would take up the whole wagon Okay so what did they bring What did they bring Hannah A gun They did they brought a gun And food okay So they didn t bring their furniture with them Why not Why didn t they bring their furniture Cause it was too big and it would take up the whole wagon Okay Okay Didn t they have more than one wagon Yes That s right a wagon train very good Okay I m gonna leave you guys to work and I m gonna be back and check on your sod homes okay It smells very good Okay and I ll help you I see that you have trunks Why do you have a trunk Oh that s very nice to help Eli why do you all have trunks Because um the pioneers had them The pioneers had trunks Why Why did they have trunks For their clothes and stuff And toys And toys Like we re making the doll Okay what were trunks made out of Wood Wood Oh you guys are sharing it s so great Thank you So their trunks were made out of wood What kind of homes did they live in Sod houses and log homes Sod houses and log homes Log cabins And log cabins Okay That s right that s right And so when they traveled when they left their homes what did they travel in A covered wagon A covered wagon Was there just one wagon No They got in a wagon train A wagon train and what was a wagon train It s a bunch of covered wagons Oxen in a wagon train In a wagon train would you have wanted to be at the front or the back of the wagon train Why I have an idea Erase erase erase erase You won t get that dirty You won t get that dirty Why would you not get that dirty at the front Because they can t move their Okay Okay What would happen in the wagon train Would they take care of each other Yeah Okay What if a wheel broke off of a wagon They would have to help each other Okay okay they would help each other Tell me this Eli Where was the wagon where were the wagons going West They were going West Why were they going West Cayden They thought they would settle the land Okay Karev why did the government give them free land Okay they were What did they have to do on that land Build a house Okay build a house that s right That s right so what kind of house did they build A sod house They made a sod house Why did they not make a wood house Because there weren t a lot of trees on the prairie Okay but you said the trunks were made out of wood how did they get trunks made out of wood Because they made it before they left They made it before they left that s correct Can the doll have long hair You re doing a great job You re just gonna have to imagine that That s right they made their trunks before they left Did they just need one trunk No Okay Twice Okay Do you know Eli Can you go show me on the map where the pioneers went on the prairie where the prairie was Okay and what is that The Prairie The prairie and how do you know it s a prairie Because there s no like mountains there How do you know there s no mountains Because these are the mountains Just like regular colors are not Okay and so on the prairie what kind of homes did they build Sod houses Sod houses So where did they build their log houses at Right in this area Okay Very good and why did they build em there What was there Wood A lot of wood Good job You can go sit down Thank you You did a great job Very good job Did they take everything with them on the trip Why did they not take everything with them Okay so when they got there did they have furniture to put into their sod homes No because They just moved in they had just moved in Where there good things about a sod home Eli what was good about a sod home That s right and what made them that way Because the ground is cooler Okay the ground is cooler Were the log homes good as well Yeah Okay but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house It s not warm in winter And do you remember when we did a Venn Diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two Yeah So that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through What was the best structure to live in A log cabin A log cabin So that animals couldn t get on top of it and If you lived in a dug out Cayden would you if it came a big rain storm would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out Back Why It s a dryer place isn t it Okay you guys continue to work okay Tell me what you know about a log house Willie tell me something you know about a log house Okay they didn t have any air conditioners Kennedy you guys are making a log house What are you putting in your log house Dolls and some family and some furniture Okay Did they have a lot of furniture for their log house Brody Did they have furniture for their log house Yeah but when they got there they had to have time to gather up some furniture That s right when they first moved there they didn t have any furniture But eventually they built some didn t they I see you re putting a fireplace in there What did they burn in their fireplace They were burning um buffalo chips They are In a log house they re burning buffalo chips That s right in a sod house they re gonna burn buffalo chips Why not wood in a sod house Because in a prairie they would run out of if they had enough wood they would build a wood house build a log house That s exactly right Were there buffalo chips where there were log houses No Why were there not buffalo chips So buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were Where did the buffalo live What was it called The prairie The prairie And what is a prairie Open grasslands that s exactly right And what are you making Dillon A quilt Why are you making a quilt Tell me why the pioneers needed quilts for To sit on them what else did they do with them Willie They on them when they were on their way What else Dillon Okay did they not have beds Yes No they didn t Okay That s right Okay they had to sleep on the floor Are you putting a kitchen in your log house No because they Well where did they keep their food at The root cellar Where tell me about a root cellar What s a root cellar It s where they kept their frozen food Okay was it inside the log cabin or was it outside Outside Okay And what was the root cellar like Okay Brody you re exactly right that is great thinking That is great thinking Did they keep any food inside their homes Yes What d they keep inside their homes Flour and sugar Flour and sugar and where would they have kept those In what container What kind of container Were they barrels that they put them in Yeah Yeah they were barrels You guys are doing a great job and you re working together and I m gonna come back and check on you in a little bit all right Look what I made What is that Willie It s what A lantern A lantern why do you have a lantern in your log house Okay and so you can see Yeah That s right cause they didn t have electricity did they Cause they had So they could see to cook Good thinking I need to do my little girl okay I ll do the girl 
 How you guys doing So 3 Oh what did you do by touching those It made a short circuit It crossed Wow the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple Yeah It s only 3 Why do you think that is 03 Maybe because It s like different rods or something Oranges are more sour than the other fruit Not and like have more acid or something Because it stops the energy We want it a half centimeter apart right Yeah Two centimeters Around So okay go ahead Make sure they aren t touching 0 1 It s not even measuring at all Oh 0 1 0 01 Oh 01 That s crazy I know How this supposed to be one the other two were so high 0 98 I never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy Except for oranges I thought this would have as much as the apple My hypothesis I actually thought that the orange would have the most Go ahead Alright Lizzy you can do the voltage reader Stick them in a half centimeter apart And a centimeter in Okay Lizzy make sure they don t touch Don t short circuit them It s like completely zero The bigger it is the more volts it has The middle one it left like a little here and this was the most I think it s more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else Hmm I wonder why that would be Okay so now we have to get a calculator Okay so 0 22 Plus 0 09 Plus 0 28 I got 0 1966667 So what are you gonna do with that number Round it up Okay 0 20 But wait doesn t someone else need to try it Oh yeah yeah yeah that s a good idea 0 22 plus 0 oh never mind Divided by three I got the same answer So what was the answer to the investigative question What do you think The The apple had the most Do you agree with that Yes Why do you think that is Do you have any guesses It s It s bigger It could carry more volts It has yeah It has like more juice Yeah that s true I think the juice Was your hypothesis correct Actually it was Like right here well Well actually I said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with but I guess apples would work better What was yours I thought the I thought the carrots would produce more because you know usually when you like eat one it s like very wet wet when you just get them so I thought the carrot was going to win but guess not I thought it was the apple I already said that My hypothesis I thought I think the potato would have the most because I heard like I ve heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts So I suspected that they may have been have a lot of voltage also Okay To our investigative question our question was which fruit will produce the most energy And the Kiwi Kiwi and apple had tied for it 0 98 So I don t know maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results I wonder why the orange was so low though Maybe because we since we put it too deep or something No we did the same thing we put all of them Yeah I know Well So then our so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest So how about your hypothesis I thought orange would have it I thought orange would have it I thought orange had it too And had the highest Why Because it had like I thought the apple would because we didn t I thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was How about you Kirsten what did you think I thought the orange because it has more citrus in it I mean yeah I would have thought kiwi would have less because it s so small Yeah me too That s what I thought Then what was our evidence Apple had for an average had 0 98 Orange had 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 06 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 98 So kiwi and apple tied And then our evidence is our data table because that s where we recorded everything Yep So then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation We did them the same length apart and So what are you guys trying to figure out over here We re we re trying to figure out what if the apple carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery What is the food representing in this case A battery Okay Yeah Okay how you gonna figure that out What is your plan We are gonna do gonna try to do a voltage reader and put try to see how much voltage there is in an apple potato or a carrot I think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage well like the apple but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an S battery Series Series let s do series Let s try series It lights up more Yeah it s brighter Okay let s get it done Oh wait we re gonna need more There s a wire in here So I think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter Or at all because it has I think it s gonna have the most it has the most voltage and so it ll make it become brighter Which do you Oh wait we re doing a series battery so Maybe we Where s the other apple It s over there Reece has it Need to wrap it around tight Can I check Jayden do you wanna do it Sure I ll have the honors Keep this one untouched because I m gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to this negative Just the white one Okay there is no wire in this Okay so I think we have enough wires here What do you need the wires for To wrap around to make a series To allow the energy to flow through Okay so what s the purpose of the wires So that the energy will be able to flow What is the energy that s going through the wires Electricity But okay so what is the function of the wires To like be able to pass from one spot to like the battery to the light Okay so you have two different wires Why is that To be able to You know why you have two different wires Um no No I m gonna give you a minute to think about it Okay Is it working No not yet Well I don t think it s working I think I didn t Oh it s going No I don t think I wrapped the wire around right Oh yeah because the This is really short So yeah it was tucking it Let s see that and that and that Yeah that thing s wrapped up tight Well if the volts are enough Don t the apples have to be touching No they don t have to be touching They just have to be the wires just have to go from positive to negative Yeah True But if they don t have enough voltage we should use a potato Yeah we can put the potato to help Yeah we need to put them in every fruit And then connect the wires like that to that that to that So make sure they don t touch Yeah so kinda wrap it around with the wire Yeah try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that Do you what do you guys think do you think that fruit could power our school I don t think so It might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here but You don t think there s enough voltage to supply our whole school No Well like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something I don t know how that would turn out but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top Would you think that would be economical You think that would be beneficial to us in any way Maybe Why It could but we d have to keep changing out the fruit and changing out the fruit It d be lots more work that s for sure Don t let them touch That connects to that and that Do we have another one Because this one is broken Can we borrow one from over here Oh we have one There you go What do you think is gonna happen I think it ll like because we have none of the same touching First we should check the voltage Well I don t we ll just see if it lights the light No don t connect those Why would you wanna check the voltage Just to see if it has enough potential of battery Would make more electricity All the averages I think it should be good this way Because we tested a battery and saw how much it was Connect one to it Then connect yours Lizzy Maybe did we do it wrong No I don t think so Well I think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit Maybe it Try an separate those a little more Kirsten Maybe they re both plus and plus Maybe it s because we re using three types of fruit If we use just two What if we took the prongs out and replace that with this Okay try that Put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it Well don t What are we trying to do here We were trying to make all these the same one Why would you do that Maybe because they need to be the same From the both positive and negative Oh And we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus doesn t matter which way And that and that needs to touch and then that one and that one which is exactly what we did But wait 
 The yellow has less water That s true And more H plus Because a higher concentration of The higher the concentration of the acid Yes Yes So you think it s something about the acid that s causing the color Yeah What about the blue food coloring This stays the same Yeah But why would you think this stays the same and it s the acid that s changing color Okay so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same but the amount of acid is not So I must be changing the color of the acid So it s the acid that s changing color You re not changing the color of the acid though Anybody else got ideas about that That something else that could explain it That s one hypothesis You put the same amount of food coloring in every time right Yeah Wait so the acid is probably likely to maybe like lose an electron The acid loses electrons What is an acid It gives up an H plus right There are more moles of Hydrogen ions Right acid s dissociate So I got more molds of H plus in this one Okay Emma you have an idea Well there are more I think I might have gotten it confused Basically there s a higher concentration of acid as you go along right So more here Yeah There s more when it s lighter Lowest most Yeah I know Okay So that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change then Because there are more H pluses if you will that could cause it to jump in energy Okay so you got the idea of energy is some kind of something s jumping Because you know Could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that s changing Okay Which is why the blue color changes to the like brownish yellow So now what is your idea about what s changing color The orbital the food coloring is changing color The food coloring is changing color Yeah the food okay so that makes sense The food coloring is changing color but the acid concentration is making it change color Yeah So the food coloring s like the dependent variable right What is in the food coloring That s a good question That s what we need to know What is in the food coloring The same thing that s in the cabbage indicator actually Well something similar they re called anthocyanins And I have a little handout to show you what they look like So before we do that though Actually no I ll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here So here s an anthocyanin It s this molecule here So usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them Okay So what is happening what is causing the different colors So we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping In the food coloring In the food coloring But the food coloring isn t transition metal It s not a transition metal no Can you still have that happen Well what else could there be Well I think it s the O H because Is it like splitting up the p orbitals What makes you say that There s like SP 3 orbitals and I guess p2 orbitals Okay so are you saying it s that splitting of SP 3 and SP 2 orbitals or the P orbitals I was thinking it s the P orbitals Okay so what here would represent the P orbitals Whatever bonded with the acid The O H maybe Oh would it be the no Okay so here s what we re going to do I m going to give you this handout and what I would like you to do I want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color Then I want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color okay You should have highlighters by your table Purple I ll take green Do you want us to do it for all of them Yeah let s just do it let s do it for the first one to start with Anthocyanins in red wine we ll do that So anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds Anything that has color really wine grapes cabbage red onions food coloring Are they they re not in colorless though right Or are they Say it again They can t be colorless because it s colorless Well kind of you ll see We ll explain that in a little bit yeah Is something colorless because they don t have any d electrons or like the d orbital is filled up with electrons Or are there other factors Yes that s true for transition metals But for other things For other things that are colorless what would explain why they were colorless It would have to be a different orbital Different wave length Like the absorption based on the bond Yes to both of you So Riley s idea is that maybe so what did we say color came from earlier Color in general where does color in general come from Reflecting certain frequencies and absorbing other frequencies of light right Okay so we can only see purple to red So is there another explanation for why something might be colorless Because it Probably because it s absorbing everything Well if it was absorbing everything what color would it be Black Oh it s not absorbing anything It s not absorbing anything Or not absorbing Any color It s not absorbing what we can see It s not absorbing what we can see that s right It s not absorbing what we can see It reflects all the colors So you guys see a pattern yet Can I borrow somebody s Let me borrow yours Let s put it under the camera as an example here What do you notice Were we supposed to highlight Single bonds yes What do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds The double bonds right next to each other The double bonds are next to the single bonds The double bond are next to the single bonds That s right that s right Okay in the first one where you have What color is the first one does is say It just says colored Red wine But we have colored and we have colorless Okay so in the colored one how many can you count how many times it goes double single double single double single That s like a tongue twister It s seven in colored I got seven Okay so now count colorless and see what you get What did you guys get For double single I got like 14 Okay so are you counting double and single as Yeah yeah Okay so you basically got seven too Okay so do colorless now Double bonds between every single bond between the bonds with the C N O I got eight for colored I got 17 in the singles and eight doubles for that Okay what s the difference between colored and colorless basically And the number of double and single bonds There are more singles than colorless Okay not the total numbers oh wait there s more singles than colorless Okay that s a way we can look at it Okay see if the same We got seven for colorless Okay Is it supposed to be the same number No no no it s not supposed to be the same Alright let s hear what Gracie has to say Say what you just said So in colored there s more doubles and there s less singles So that means that there s going to be more of the single doubles But then in colorless there s less doubles and more singles so that means there s less single doubles Can somebody restate that Just so that I can make sure that you understand what she said Does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are that colors So say it again When there are more double bonds there s a color or something Okay when there s more double bonds there s a color Does that seem like the pattern we re noticing here It has to do with pi bonding Why does it have to do with pi bonding Because it s an overlap of p orbitals Overlap of p orbitals Which allows the delocalized electrons to like Okay so what did you say Con Delocalization Delocalization the delocalization comes from Pi bonds what is a pi bond It s the overlap of what P orbitals P orbitals p orbitals okay So when it goes double single double single double single what s happening there How does that create It s like one big pi bond Like when you have like earlier you were talking about whatcha ma call its I can t articulate Delocalization No like One giant p orbital Yeah like sort of yeah one giant p orbital Like one giant pi bond it like expands from like through different Oh and like a benzene shape and then that makes a circle Yeah and it s not actually like here s one here s one pi bond here s one pi bond here s one It s like they re like all pi bonded They re like all pi bonded to each other okay So in which case in which case are they all pi bonded to each other The colored form or the colorless form I d say colored because they are all close to each other Like the pi bonds The pi bonds say it again They re close to each other They re close to each other in the colored form So is there more There s more double bonds There s more double bonds in the colored Yeah so they would have to be closer to each other There are more double bonds in colored less double bonds in colorless Okay so how many of you say there s less double bonds in the colorless Less double bonds in the colorless Three There s only seven double bonds in colorless and there s eight in colored And there s more leftover singles Wait for which one for colored Oh you re counting the far left one Yeah this one has eight This is an intermediate one So then it s seven and seven Seven and seven okay So how many if you were to try to connect So the idea is that it makes one giant p orbital If you were going to connect all of the p orbitals which one would have the most gigantic p orbital Colored Colored Is that clear to everybody Why did you say colorless Did you say colorless Yeah I don t understand why Because there s a bunch of single bonds Because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things Wait for the far left Does that make any sense We re talking about the far left one Let s look at all three So which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond The middle one The middle one Because it s an intermediate And they re more double bonds Does anyone disagree that it s going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p orbital Okay Alright let s look at some more down here Did you guys do does somebody have these highlighted No I think Rebecca you have them highlighted right Okay so let s look at these two here Can we apply our hypothesis So what is our hypothesis by the way More overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is Okay the more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is That s our hypothesis Is it supported by these two on the side here Can we highlight the exterior So what do you think Is our hypothosis supported by these two Alright Con can you explain Well I mean it just looks like there s a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double single is kind of broken Okay right so there s a streak of double single double single double single double single double single So imagine you start somewhere Have you guys ever heard the song that never ends Yes This is the song that never ends Okay we re not gonna sing it it never ends So in this case if we were to just go around going double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single would I ever get to an end necessarily Would I here How about if I went double still single double single double single double single But that s single single Single single So which one s going to have a more extensive pi bond The top one so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is the more colored it is Okay so what causes color in these compounds Shared electrons More shared electrons that are shared how Pi bonds More pi bonds equals what More area for the electrons to move around Okay more area for them More delocalization okay So let s take it back to this to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration Why are these different colors What is happening here Let s put this together Oh is it the H is taking more of the delocalized electrons because H is positive What do you think Because there s a higher concentration So say it again Okay so since H is a positive ion it takes more of the since there s more it takes more of the delocalized electrons Okay so it s taking more of the delocalized electrons So how does that explain the color change Can somebody add onto that There s less electrons so I guess there s less More double bonding There s less energy absorbed No there s increased So is more energy being absorbed or less energy being absorbed when it s yellow More energy is being absorbed that s why it s yellow Exactly that creates further Because there are more electrons bonding with the H plus than there is in the It s about absorption Ah okay Ruth say that 
 Okay what s in here do me a favor Go up and tell me what I m gonna need Put I put down the If he s right say Okay boys and girls because it is raining I need my one two three Umbrella What happened to that thing I like red Matches my jacket Maybe because it s raining This This protects me from the rain So because it is raining I need a one two three Umbrella Umbrella Umbrella I might put that

we have some examples of clothing here that you re gonna need and I want you to focus for a second with this Say it with me since Since Because Because So So Boys and girls these are words you use when speaking when you re talking about cause and effect when speaking Because it s snowing I need my heavy jacket That s cause and effect These are words we use with speaking These words let s say them just one time for a little pronunciation practice Thus Thus Therefore Therefore Consequence Three syllables Con se quence Consequence All right good good And the fact is And the fact is These are pretty much words we re gonna use in writing only We don t really speak these words not often very rare These we used in speaking since because and so And these are the words you re gonna be using today You re gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships These are more when you re writing an essay an essay like maybe for the ELA or when you re writing an academic essay Okay so we have one more You guys are doing so great And I have a lot of stuff here I have a one two three Scarf Say it with me scarf Scarf What about that F on the end Scarf Scarf Scarf Scarf Okay I like this scarf It s a nice scarf I have a what is this Sweater Sweater or sweatshirt Sweatshirt No sweater Sweater Sweater Okay I think when it s what is this outside Sunny Say it with me sunny Sunny It is sunny so I think you know what s interesting is this is the important word so So So I ll need Sunglasses Boys and girls when it gets really really sunny outside sometimes the sun hurts my eyes so I put on my sunglasses Okay so I want you to try it now I want you to try it Boys and girls now you all have in front of you two worksheets You have one worksheet in front of you you have two different ones Many of you have this worksheet and many of you have this worksheet okay I just gonna do one quick sentence here Because it is hot I ll need my Sunglasses Shirt Someone raise their hand Tina Tina say that loud Sunglasses Sunglasses Sunglasses And shorts Oh I didn t tell you about my shorts I brought those today too Say it with me shorts Shorts Say it with me shorts Shorts Okay so it s sunny and I m gonna need my shorts and sunglasses I got em I ll need my sunglasses and shorts And because here this is what you call a transition word This is what we re working on Now if I have this here Juan Pablo you have this worksheet We have cause and effect If I have this here we have let s say since it is raining I ll need my raincoat And that s a coat for rain It s on your list there So what is this word here Say it with me since Since Since is a transition word In speaking and then sometimes writing like this style of writing you would use these words All the time in speaking you show cause and effect Since I don t have any money I can t buy anything to eat tonight Because it s raining I think I ll go to the movies Cause and effect boys and girls Use it each and every time you think about speak about cause and effect Now I want you to try this with your partner and then we re gonna practice speaking these out On three I want you to go Three two one go Use the examples use the sentences And here s some more additional examples for you Do you see it up top Clothing Right here Clothing How would you make clothes out of that Can you see it Give it a try Can you read this to me What do you need when it s hot Okay so you see the list right here Which items are for hot Which items are for cold Can you try to write that for me I m gonna come back Look at the charts they are there to help you You see the chart that I made So let s try something I want to try something Can you read me actually read Hon Lu your first sentence And you read her your first sentence You first Partner A partner B Partner A go You first you re partner A Because it is raining I need my umbrella and raincoat Because it s hot I need my shorts Okay now you re speaking to each other not to me Okay keep going Go Since it is sunny I need my sunglasses Can you write that there Look right here That list for you Okay you see on the Look at the word Slide through it Two syllables Is that one boot One boot Or two So how is there Yes yes Boots Great This is great stuff I m proud of you So proud of you Read this You look like you haven t got started here So listen to him he did a really nice job here And let s work together okay Can you read me your first sentence Because it s hot so I need my sunglasses Good now pause Now listen I want you to try one So I need my I m sorry did you say the Umbrella If it s hot I need an umbrella No If it s which one Which one If I if it Which one do I need an umbrella 
 In my classroom each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers where they also may store their art and they ve each made a back splash of art inspirational images In the corner of the room I have a resource area including images of art books and magazines a computer with an internet connection and examples I have a board where I give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance I have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations In the corner of the room there s acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron In front of that there s soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above and also eye protection and gloves The sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps In the corner of the room you see a fire extinguisher a buffing machine a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow and ear protection a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves an emergency eyewash station and shower and first aid kit In here we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation And in the front we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher This is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry Now this isn t jewelry per se You know what these are Coins Coins There s such an interesting iconography of coins I love the patterning that happened when he cast them I mean I just think its You ve got the horse You ve got the man Some sort of a symbol I don t really know what all the symbols are but you could really use a lot of this And do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up And here people have even made jewelry out of the coins And here art is an example of in north Africa a lot of times women traditional women it s probably changing now but I don t really know how much it s changed or not changed This picture is from 1988 or something so it s in the past But they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry And they d wear it everyday And it might seem ridiculous to us you can do your farming you re going about your business cooking and you re wearing all that craziness but that way it s on them they have it if something happens to their husband nobody can take it away because it s on their body It s protected It s also very obvious If the husband were to steal the money and take it away they would know because she s not wearing it So he would be shamed So it s sort of it s like the dowry the money comes into the family from the woman s parents but it s also to help protect the woman It s not just it s not just to go to the husband So I think it s amusing that they re wearing it I thought they weren t allowed to wear makeup Well it depends in what part of where you are I mean are you thinking who is they I m thinking Iran and stuff and north Africa Right Iran there s different sects of Islam and what people believe as really strict is different In this north Africa Iran s more in the Middle East getting closer I mean does it even even in Asia it might even be Asia No it s not in north Africa It s not in Africa So this is like north Africa there s a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert It s all intermixed And people in southern Africa like in Sudan are predominantly Islamic and they have a different take on it too So maybe in Iran it s frowned upon as vanity but The Muslim culture requires women to cover their faces It s not Muslim religions that only It s Arabian That s very good Chloe Very very astute It s there traditions It s not required by the religion it s a cultural thing That s good That s a good clarification I didn t think of it that way So also this redeemable investment or wealth people like to and they have people over for dinner Golden silverware On the right that was the silverware of Marie Antoinette I ve never heard of gold silverware So gold I know they re eating on gold And it can t be 24 carat because it would be too soft But it s probably a gold alloy And there s also cases of people when times get tough melting down their silverware So they can have the Yeah and you use that as your it s like people nowadays are investing in gold They re buying gold bars because it s like you own something You see it It s not just a piece of paper that says you own something Yeah I think there s commercials about buying gold And this is a chalice through the church The church accumulated a lot of wealth specifically the Catholic church during the Medieval times And they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood Okay attraction and beauty This is pretty obvious because where do people usually wear jewelry On their necks and faces and Yeah yeah to draw attention I think to the face usually is a big deal And also this is an example of a Cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman So a lot of times it s with the idea of love or commitment romantic love Here we have Indians from India and these are things that you can buy This is just off of that So this is like the traditional wedding where you ve got kind of an inexpensive version perhaps that you can buy There s all sorts there s all levels of expense that you can buy And here we are again with north Africa Just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn t beautiful I don t know How many of you have tattoos Any of you have a tattoo I wish Okay I mean you re a little bit young Right Do you think you might want a tattoo at some point Yeah my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back Really Do you like it Yeah it s really pretty but I wouldn t want something like that Yeah I don t remember what it says Something it has to do with swimming I think It s like swimming In some way It s a really good quote though Yeah she looks like that girl from Avatar You know I haven t seen Avatar but as a movie designer James Cameron what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie Probably If you I mean does anybody like Star Wars That was a popular kind of thing But you know I always wanted the hair braids Mom mom please She s like Your hair isn t long enough That was a movie They had it was a wig I was like Do it Do it I braid my hair put beads in it sometimes There are cultures that wear their hair like that So it s like nothing is sort of new under the sun People are reinventing what s already happened I always wanted it just like Pocahontas that s the entire story The second time I saw it I was like Oh this is really bad One thing they represented it wrong that s like the reason they were there because it was very valuable Oh so you re thinking it could have been a little more creative You know the first time you see it it s so good And then the second time you re like Hey now that I ve seen this So it s good to critique pop culture to determine If you get a job in the movies how would you do it better or differently I d do a different plot I d be more creative Okay yeah we better I m gonna keep moving on All right Okay so here we have ancient Egypt on the left and we have Miss South Carolina 2000 I can t remember 2004 2006 recently Isn t it interesting how similar the eye the eyeliner the long eyebrow the hair coming down the crown You know I mean I think the eyebrows Well she doesn t have the I m trying to create a bead kind of thing Okay Melting the stuff Drew was using for his corset together Oh the screen So you re melting the screen Oh interesting So how will you use that in your I m thinking I can use it in attaching because I think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that not gold and shell ish Okay Okay well do you want to go look at your stuff Or do you want to or you feel like you need to finish that Oh no that s fine There appears to be no blue stuff Oh the pickle It s new Oh It only gets blue from the copper so it it does have pickle in it It s just fresh and new So you could you could see that little yogurt container You can put it in that and that has holes in it and then you can just kind of let that float Just kind of put a little in there Like tip it Yeah that s good Okay yeah let s go look at your Oh should we look at those Would you rather do those or Okay let s go Sorry we re going outside now Okay Oh wow What do you think I like them I really like them as not a shell color because they don t seem Can I touch it Sorry I touched it before I asked you I think once you like as I did just find the shell along the stream Right you re transforming it I really like the shell of the spray paint too because it helps tie it in with the metal It makes well it s metallic spray paint so it seems really metal y yeah Right Cool And it makes it a little bit more blingy You know And I like how it reflects the light all the cracks and stuff Yes it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation Especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it Then this unifies them It makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people s clothes Do you think About how would you how will you attach are you thinking of using these in one group Or are they more pendants I think they re more like pendants and I was gonna poke a hole Okay Like two holes in them and I was gonna use a bunch of different strings together So it s kind of like and they re right there And maybe bead it a bunch of beaded strings So really this is like one necklace that s or is it many necklaces that people can layer It s just one necklace Okay all right Well let s can we go look at your sketch book too The other thing is next time it would be better I think to drill the hole first before you paint it Okay Because I m afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole I was going to just poke a hole with a needle Can you do that I think so I mean they re really a lot more soft than metal Oh okay well try it and see if it works But I have a diamond drill bit It can drill and that s what Drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff Okay and also most of these already have holes Oh yeah because of the creature that eats the muscle Yeah I love the hole that s already in there yeah okay All right let s go look at that These probably need to dry a little more Yes Okay okay let s go in There s only five more minutes on here Okay that s good We ll get this and that ll be okay Oh look at that See that s amazing to me because whenever I find coquinas I guess I find the live coquinas I ve never seen the shells like just the shells But they all have a hole This is a great find I got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach Yes Because they all lay next to each other in the sand And when you I mean now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry I m not sure yet because Here I ll come over is this better like this Yeah I could use like I could put them all together on one string on one necklace Sort of like the coral But I don t know I don t think I have enough for that from reproduction Well you have a lot What might be better right because you re right Because then they would nest Right If you just put with cubicle then they don t take up much space What if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one And that could put see how you have sort of charms on your chain You could these could also be sort of like charms hanging down and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring could have a little chain And it could hang down to vary the length or or you said that you like to use did you make your necklace that s woven there That s okay you but you know how to sew So could you sew them on something I could yeah I mean I have some leather strip and that would be keeping with natural materials So that might be interesting I don t know I well I think what you need to do is to experiment sew some do some metal through some and then maybe lay some out And you can see how Chloe has hers laid out in that box so that she can keep it I think you d need a box or a tray and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them Yeah Now what are these Those are Oh and these are a dove s feathers They re so elegant Yes Now do you have your sketch book Can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this Here I think I got it Here you go I could do this with the shell Oh because that s hanging off And then what is this round ring part I m not sure It could just be like a round golden It could be a soldered ring of metal like brass wire soldered together Is this an earring Yes Okay That may be for these Right That was that s what I was planning to do with the shell For that I could do a bunch of different strings or I could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string or something Right right asymmetry Okay I like it And then this is the feather These are jump rings and this is the feather 
 Okay guys yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned we studied we found definitions for Those words were adaptation there s habitat and community Okay adaptation is the first word Who can tell me something about adaptation Karina Adaptation is how animals act like the howler monkeys they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger so they can survive Okay so they can survive right Adaptation helps them survive And then habitat Who can tell me what habitat is Ernesto Where you live Okay it s the environment where they live It s the surroundings okay It s the trees it s the plants it s the ground and it s the climate that they live in And the last one is community Okay so if we re thinking about animals what makes up a community for these animals Who can tell me Sergio The community What makes up a community It s not the environment The animals It s all the animals Do we have just one animal in the community We have many we have many It could be very many Okay we re going to on and I d like you to listen to this sound Shhhh Just listen to this sound Okay you may have and you can hear this sound at night Okay what I d like you yo do right now is tell me one thing that you know about this animal okay If you know the name of this animal go ahead and write that down too First of all let s just write it in our K Just put it under for K What do you know about that animal Just write it down first then we ll talk about it I d like you to discuss what you know also Talk to a neighbor Okay this is what you know so you are going to be looking at that What is something you know about that animal Okay Tell your neighbor What do you know about this animal Just tell a neighbor Tell a neighbor what you know Tell your neighbor Eddie what you know What do you know You can talk out loud guys Okay small ears okay All right so write that down Okay now after that go to what you want to know Go to the W What do you want to know about this animal By the way what animal is this An owl It s an owl It s a Great Horned Owl okay Now what I d like you to do you want to put this information Yea what do you want to know So write one thing about what you want to know What do you want to know Tell a neighbor What do you want to know Sergio You don t have to whisper you can say it How old an owl can live Okay good Good okay Now one thing I want you to think about Let s listen to this sound again okay Listen to the sound again Any predictions and you can just tell me without writing them down What do you think that Why does the owl make the sound that it makes Yea Maybe to warn other owls Warn other owls Anything else Yea Ernesto To communicate And to communicate that s right Okay let s take a look a page twenty three Okay we re going to look at text structure on page 23 This is the Great Horned Owl And I d like everyone to put your finger on the title for this animal the Great Horned Owl Just put your finger so I know you know what the title is Next I d like you to put your finger on the caption Okay and can I have one person read the caption Let s have Karina read the caption Owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark Okay very good Then we have underneath the title of the Great Horned Owl We have what I call bullet points We talked a little bit about them And put your fingers on the bullet points there And let s have Ernesto read those bullet points Bird found in North Central and South America Live in the canopy and understory Understory very good And we live in what continent Eddie what continent do we live in North America North America So we ll find these and actually I will usually hear these at night And usually hear them kind of in the winter time All right let s have the first paragraph Eddie why don t you continue The Great Horned Owl has no ears but can hear anyway It can also see very good even on the darkest night Okay and the second paragraph Makayla An owl hunts for food at night from high in the air When it hears a mouse move or squeak the owl swoops down upon it Swoops okay very good Okay now we ve read about the Great Horned Owl I d like you to tell your neighbor one thing that you learned new about this owl that you are going to put down under the L What is one thing that you learned about the owl Okay so write something down that you ve talked about with your partner or your neighbor Now we re going to continue working in partners here and I m going to give you something to take a look at And I m going to have you guys just close your books for a second After you re done writing close your books Okay I m going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks I want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick okay So take a close look at it all right And take a look at it and then I d like you to put down what you know about that stick okay There are yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also But what is something look at the ends of the stick and let s put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick Okay just write it down or tell your neighbor Tell your neighbor Yeah he bit the stick on here But did he actually cut it Was he able to bite it Yes Yeah he was he was Okay all right now who can tell me what animal this might be Karina A beaver It is a beaver and you will find these in this area What I would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver So let s write that down Just skip this and go right to What do you want to know Tell your neighbor Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it What do you want to know Okay tell your neighbor guys too once you have written it down How old can a beaver live Okay how old can a beaver live That s good Yea Keelie What I want to know how about are they electric Okay Okay I want to know how long they are in their house maybe Yes I want to know how big can they be Okay good I have hair on here It s possible Actually yeah that is very possible you have hair of a beaver I would actually I m going to hang onto that And actually let s put that in the garbage But that s good It s right here Okay i ll take it Okay Yea you re going to find that probably we re not going to look at the sticks too much We need to find insects still living in the stick but we re going to leave that for right now I d like you to take a look at page twenty Take a look at page twenty I do recommend that if you ever by chance go to Deerbro there s a forest near the school here Your parents can take you You might actually see a beaver house Okay let s find out some more information about beaver on page twenty Put your fingers on the title Put your fingers on the title You know what I ll take that Here we go And you know what let me recollect these because we have Let me collect those back Thank you There we go Okay put your fingers on the beaver the title okay Can I have one person read the bullet again Bullet marks Sergio go ahead Mammal found in North America Europe and Asia Lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor okay and can you name another mammal If you happen to know what the mammal might be Can you name another mammal Whale A whale is a mammal and we are also mammals Okay the next paragraph I d like to have one person read that paragraph Karina Beavers eat bark twigs leaves and roots They have wide flat tails These tails help beavers to clear a placement Beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur They also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur This oil helps keep them warm in the water Okay before we go on as we re going to be looking at a lot of things think about what it is you re learning What s something new that you re learning about this beaver Now before we go on everybody put your finger on the caption Okay caption Makayla what does the caption say A beaver s fur keeps it warm in the snow All right very good So let s take one more thing We re going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen So now let s go to page seventeen And this talks a little bit more about a beaver And the title let s put our finger on the title of page 17 What does the title say Keelie Graph Section Diagram Okay we re looking at page 17 right here Put your finger on the top of the diagram And that s the title What does it say Keelie Beaver lodge Okay what is we know a beaver is the animal What s a lodge Keelie Their house where they live Yea it s like their house Okay next there s a caption built into the diagram and it s green Let s have Sergio read the caption there This beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor If it wouldn t float the lodge will have to be rebuilt Okay very good Let s get some more information There s some other things in the diagram to give us information Makayla Some lodges are two meters 6 5 high Okay very good And Keelie The lodge is made from logs and sticks Okay and Eddie the last one Beavers come in and out under the water Okay so this is where they live This is how they live and why do you think they build their house this way Anybody What do you think they do Why do they build it this way Karina Because when they when people come like hunters if they want to catch them It is going to be difficult for them Okay like predators Other predatory animals Yeah So this is a way they adapt So how do they adapt to survive in their environment Makayla To enter from the underground water Okay can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence Beavers Beavers adapt to Beavers adapt how Yea Karina Beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water Okay so they adapt in that way other predators can t see when they re coming And as we saw on the sticks the sticks they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this okay So what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again Using the word habitat I d like you to tell me What s the habitat of a beaver They live in lodges They live in lodges Okay what s around their lodge Yeah Karina Sticks and wood Okay sticks but then what is this blue stuff here Water It s water Yeah so they actually go underwater to get into their home And that makes it very safe So I would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer Okay Okay once you ve got one third okay And Eddie when you ve got something why don t you tell your neighbor When you ve got something tell your neighbor what you learned Like this Okay Actually right here yea What you ve learned Okay and if you were to go out somewhere and you were in the woods what would you see What do you think you would see from this house This is all water so all you re going to see Are you going to see the hole that s here No No What do you think you re going to see The sticks Just like a stick Just a mound of sticks about two meters high Which is probably about that tall 
 In my opinion I think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself telling the principal I should not pay 15 00 because then it wouldn t be a scholarship Okay thank you very much I like the way the way you show you know how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket Thank you very much I agree with Julia because you should not choose people for like what kind of races they are or their culture You should choose them for what they ve been through like their hardest work or something Okay So you mean they had jobs they had work it was right to feel that Very good good job Okay I think Martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it Okay In my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise and a great leader is wise Okay I agree with Alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn t pay for the jacket He didn t pay for the jacket So you thought because he didn t pay for the jacket then he s a great leader You think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that s what made him a great leader No I think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying oh okay here s the money Okay so a greater leader should stand for what he believes Is that what you are saying Yes Very good Thank you very much for clarifying that Go ahead Daniel I was going to say that I agree with Jennifer I think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe Thank you very much Go ahead In my opinion I think Martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight As and being a good student All right Thank you Go ahead Lisette In my opinion Martha s grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like Martha s grandpa Very good So you need to stand your ground Very good I think that the person who showed the most leadership was Martha Even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned she believed that even though the teachers they they some wanted to give it to someone else but some knew that she had earned it and she she spoke up not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself Okay So you feel a great leader you know she speak up you know when something is wrong or in the way She shouldn t just keep it Very good She has to tell someone Very good good job Go ahead It seems to me that Martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket Okay what are some of the other things you know that Martha did She got she got since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble and be a good student Okay so that means you know she has worked hard all this time Very good Thank you Okay go ahead I believe that Martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn t give up on trying to get it So a good leader you know she ll try to do whatever it takes you know to get what he or she wants Is that what you re saying Yes All right Good job Thank you In my opinion I think Mr Schmidt is a great leader because he was fair you know to fight for Martha and not the other girl Thank you Who is the other girl Joanne Huh Joanne Okay so Mr Schmidt was fair enough you know to fight for Martha instead of who Joanne Joanne Thank you very much In my opinion it s Martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best All right In my opinion I think Mr Smith because even though Martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades Because of her good grades Good job In my opinion I believe that the one that showed leadership was Mr Smith because he was honest and fair to Martha Very very good Thank you very much I agree with her because Mr Booney just wanted the person that had money which is Joanne Her father owned the only store in town So Mr Schmidt was actually being fair Okay Thank you for adding on to that Now who is Joanne s dad You know because everybody was saying I could hear Juan you know when Juan said because of Joanne s dad Who is Joanne s dad How can we describe him He owns the only store in town Hmm He owns the only store in town He owns the only store in town What else He s also part of the school board He s rich School board Huh He s part of the school board so they had the decisions like in the school like what they do and stuff In the story he gives money to the school so maybe that s also why they wanted to pick Joanne so they got more money Very good Thank you very much Now that everybody has contributed now let s look at the next question The next question is this what does Martha represent to you Think about the leadership qualities that Martha showed What does Martha represent to you Not only the leadership qualities all the other things that Martha represents okay Anybody can start Anybody can start Just jump in I believe that Martha to me represents a great leader Her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up Thank you for sharing that She represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it She stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say Very good It seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly Great Like that Anybody can jump in It seems to me that Martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket I disagree because Martha did speak up for herself Her grandfather just told her what to say I disagree because like her grandfather gave her most of her ideas If it wasn t for her grandfather she probably would ve tried to get the money But like her father said I mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it I agree with Daniel because like well yeah I agree with Arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn t have to pay for it instead of Martha going to speak to the principal in person I disagree with that I disagree with that I disagree I disagree with Daniel and Javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say her grandpa didn t go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually Martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say I agree with Myra because it s true I mean he didn t go Martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said So that s why I say that Martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather The grandfather might ve said that but she was the one that stood there and said it That took a lot of courage to me Okay So you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough So I like what Arkie said Arkie said you know I disagree that Martha was a leader and Arkie open up that Thank you very much Archimedes Thank you all of you for sharing that Any other person To me Martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble Okay She worked really hard Thank you Any other person that wanted to add something It seems to me that Martha is a that proves that it doesn t matter her race or color she could do anything the same as anybody else can do Wow I agree with Ashley because a lot of people discriminate like Mexican people or like Mexican Americans just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they re not from the United States So you know what has Martha done to straighten that or to disprove that She showed that who cares where you re from or who you are you can always do your best Okay So you know there was Martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing If we really work hard we know that it will work Is that what I m hearing from all of you Yes That it doesn t matter what race you know if you work really hard you know that you can achieve Thank you very much for sharing that I really admire her because I know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it s somewhat sad because some people aren t allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they re from What I think is that it doesn t matter what you are No one is bad except for the person who s making fun of your race You are not the bad one it s the person who s making fun of you Thank you very much Any other person that wants to add something to this I agree because in a poem it says you can t persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them like persuade them Thank you very much Now let s go on to the last question Thank you very much for sharing I could hear from all of you The last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with Scholarship Jacket Think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations Okay So think of that What other stories have you read okay Anyone can start I think Crossing the Wire is somewhat similar because Pablo was Mexican too and they mistreated him and denied him a job However he worked as hard as Martha Thank you for sharing that You call that Crossing what Crossing the Wire Crossing the Wire Thank you I think the story of Martin Luther King is pretty similar to The Scholarship Jacket because they discriminated a lot against African Americans because of their color but Martin Luther King stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we re different We re all the same just because of color doesn t separate us Thank you very much for sharing that I agree with Jennifer Martin Luther King said that it doesn t matter where you re from or who you are everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers Thank you very much for sharing that I have seem the movie The Blind Side which is pretty similar to the story Michael shows great leadership because he is an African American and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a Catholic school to play football Thank you I agree with Carlos I ve also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely Michael I agree with Carlos because in that movie Michael from the beginning he didn t want to go to school he actually had really low grades and the family he had they re from another race and even though he had really low scores they got him a tutor and they helped him like reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play Wow Thanks again I have read The Outsiders which is a story about two classes of people the Greasers and the Soches The greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class Okay At the end what happened Did they succeed like Martha Did they achieve Some of them died Some of them died okay 
 Yeah Why don t we list that up here Okay Here is what you re going to do Go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick Put those pencils away in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and just to make sure you haven t Now you have identified you have taken this work of art you ve seen what it is and you ve taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used Now we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements What kind of thought feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements with this subject So who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found What s one Shapes Shapes What s another one Color Color Shape lines Value Value Texture You guys with those elements they re telling you something So here s what we re going to We re going to put on our thinking pairing and sharing hats So whatever I do that so you guys can pair and share together will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference Thank you All right First question ready The first question is how does this man feel Now think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel No talking Think to yourself Think Shh You ve got to tell me why too Don t just think about feeling Tell me why Two people look like they re pairing already Don t pair yet Now tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking is feeling is feeling All right Now we re ready to share with the whole group So I m going to start with right here with Jermaine s group and we re going to go around and each person is going to get a turn or each pair is going to get a turn So first what was your group thinking How did he feel Sad Why Because the color blue is a sad color And he looked down So he had two reasons he had the body position because he s kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten good job he said that sad and the color blue go together What do you guys think How does he feel I think he feels happy He s smiling and he s playing the guitar Okay because he s creating music Maybe that s what makes him happy I heard Miss Webster had a disagreement when they were pairing Miss Webster what is your take What do you think he s feeling Tell me what you think he is Sit up tell me what you think he is I think he s sad because Okay Because why He looks what Say it again honey Don t be embarrassed It s okay to have a different opinion I think he is lonely because he doesn t have any friends There s nobody else in that picture He is by himself in the picture Maybe he s lonely We don t know Okay So we had a difference of opinion That s okay Next pair I think he s sad because he s looking down If he was happy he d be Whoa Wait a minute She just said this man doesn t have anything to eat Why do you think he doesn t have any Because his shirt is torn he don t have no pants and he don t have no socks So you re telling me he looks what Is he rich or is he poor No He s poor Okay That is very good insight on not only the details but also just what those details are telling us okay Do you have something else to add What would you say I said I think he was happy to sit alone I think he s happy because he just Okay So you think the guitar looks even though his clothing looks torn his guitar looks nice right Maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice Maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes Maybe not Last pair tell me what you think he s feeling I think he s One at a time I think he s It looks like he s playing a sad song He s playing a sad song and he s playing Why do you think it looks like he s playing a sad song Because he s bowing his head down and his face don t look very happy Okay You guys next question I can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat Did you have something different than that Okay Go ahead I think he s sad because he looks like he s homeless Oh maybe he s homeless Now why do you think he s homeless Because his shirt s torn on the side Are there any other clues besides his clothing We already had Miss Marshall tell us about his clothing What other clues do we have that makes us think he s homeless without talking and making noise Jermaine do you have a clue why he might be homeless Why Because he s outside by his self He looks like me might be outside This might be a step that he s sitting on Next question Next question what do you think the artist is trying to tell us What is the important message put your hands down Think What is the message Why is the artist painting this picture of this man I have one person she s got herself in the thinking posture She s thinking Think please Think think think I ve got a good thinker at this table I hope you re thinking honey Okay Now pair up Ready Pair and share with your table mate Get paired up Thirty more seconds to share I hear some good talking so I m giving you 30 more seconds Why don t you share this time because you shared last time Okay So you re going to share this time Let s see you sitting up nice and tall We re going to share with the entire group We all learn from each other You guys we re going to start with the opposite way I m going to go this way Can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us by painting this picture I m sorry just a second Could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve You guys when you re listening to what he s saying he s trying to tell you what he thinks what his table mate thinks So you need to turn your body make eye contact and really listen to what he s saying okay Okay Go again I think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he s homeless He doesn t have any money He doesn t have any value Okay When you mean value do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean Like he seems very sad Okay So you re talking about the color right Okay Next group I think that the artist is trying to persuade him Wait a minute Say that word again He s trying to what Persuade Persuade us what Persuade us to think what Persuade us He feels real mad or trying to do music or something Okay Is that what your team came up with You came up with something different than your team You had a disagreement right I think that I was not Do you think the artist wants you to be like him No What do you think the artist wants you to learn from him He won t have nothing to work You can have a better life right Okay This group could you put your feet down It s your turn You re going to share with us what your team came up with You can share Come on You can talk to us Remember that there s no wrong answer It s just what you think 
 So just leave your clicker on your table guys I mean you can put one in front of you just don t turn it on yet they re not activated Please don t play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day Thank you for the help Excellent thanks All right guys so let s get started with our discussion here Set the clicker down please don t play with it just leave it on the table thank you I asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question Danny DeVito is between 4 9 and 5 1 tall So i m 5 10 so Danny DeVito is either between this tall or about this tall We re not sure on his height His wife Rhea Perlman is 5 0 tall How tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why All right so please raise your hand to share your answer and I m going to ask you why you think like you do So I m going to start back there with Alex So turn this way so that I can hear you okay Okay I think their kids would be around 5 because their mom is 5 tall and their dad his middle height is 5 Okay so you re looking at the middle estimated height of Danny DeVito and his wife s height is 5 so you think together then all their children will be 5 boys and girls Mm hm Okay Great thank you What else do you think J R I said 5 too I said 5 as well because that s about how tall they are so their kid would be around that Okay so you re looking at kind of his average height and her height so you think the kids will be around that Okay anything different or you want to explain it further Michael I just said that you get your height from your parents so whatever the parents were right around 5 the kids will be about 5 Okay you get your height from your parents So since the parents are about 5 the kids will be 5 Boys and girls Yeah Okay great What do you think Well I think the daughter could be 4 9 and the sons would be around 5 2 because both of the parents are shorter and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents Okay so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents and you said that the daughters could be about 4 9 and the sons might be about 5 2 Yes Is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls It s just kind of a normal thing Normally boys are taller than girls Okay so a normal thing boys are usually taller than girls Okay great Any other ideas on the height of their children Adam what do you think Well what do you think about I think that they ll be around I think boys and girls will both be around 5 because it s right inbetween the parents Okay good What about me and my family I m 5 10 So I m tall What do you think about my family members How tall do you think they are I m 5 10 how tall do you think my mom is How tall do you think my dad is What s your estimation What do you think Raise your hands everybody let s participate Mackenzie what do you think I think your dad would be around 6 2 and I think your mom would be around 5 11 or 5 9 Okay so my mom is between 5 9 and 5 11 so close to my height and my dad would be taller about 6 2 Brian what do you think I said that I think your dad would be taller than you but then your mom would be around the same height So my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller Yeah Anybody think anything Pardon me Or like around 6 My dad would be around 6 Yeah What if I tell you my little brother my little baby brother is 6 4 And he is This is true he is 6 4 So he s a tall guy Does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents You guys are nodding yes What do you think now Travis Maybe your dad is like 6 4 and your mom is like 5 8 or 5 9 or something Okay so Mom is about here Dad is taller or 6 4 like my little brother Michael what do you think Both of them are about 6 Both of them are about 6 Okay great what do you think Well I know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad from dads So that your dad is taller around 6 5 and then your mom is shorter like 5 8 So you see my height and my mom is about 5 8 and my dad is 6 5 so for my brother and I you re figuring about our traits What do you mean That you get your traits from your dad So my dad s genes are coming through Why do you think that Why do you think I have only traits from my dad Because I know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom So more traits from dad than from mom Do you think that s pretty much general Yeah Okay great Do you guys have anything to comment on that What do you think I think your dad s probably like 6 2 because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they re still in high school Oh interesting Well I ll tell you my mom was 5 11 at her tallest Now she s shrinking she s like 5 9 You know how that happens as you get older and my dad he s only 6 tall So my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother he s 6 1 So height does come from both sides but my dad s not as tall you guy s might ve thought Let s talk about Danny DeVito again Here he is our favorite actor right Notice his lack of hair he s bald The question on here says Danny DeVito is bald What do you think his son s hair or lack of will look like when he s older and why His son Danny DeVitto has a son What do you think about his hair Nice and loud so I can hear you Matthew It said that their son would have bald hair on the top but some on the sides Some will be bald on the top but he ll have some hair around the sides Why do you think that Because usually if somebody s dad s bald they re not always bald If somebody s dad is bald they are not always bald I ve seen that You ve seen that That s a good observation Matt What do you think Well the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald so I thought he will still have a lot more hair than his dad He wouldn t be completely bald but bald on top Okay so mom has a lot of hair dad s bald So you think the son will have hair but just bald on top Yeah So when you see the traits being passed down how do you see it I m not really sure what you mean by that question You re kind of saying that he ll have this trait but he ll also have this trait So how do you see that happening Did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another the son or do you think I think they were combined They were combined The traits are combined Good Sean I thought he would have like a blackish brown hair because that s what the mom s hair color is Okay He probably wouldn t be bald but he d have a receding hairline Okay so he would have a receding hairline and for those of us that don t know what that means that means when a person starts to lose their hair and it kind of inches back and they re losing their hair That s what a receding hairline is So the hair falls out as it moves back Are you ready to see what Danny Devito s kids look like Here they are for our predictions We have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family He s about 5 5 So he s taller than both mom and dad This is Danny Devito s wife Danny Devito and his son Here s his daughters This daughter is about the height of the mom but she has big shoes on The other daughter is taller But notice their hair what do you notice about their hair Ryan tell me what you notice about all three kids Well they all have hair they re not bald They all have hair they re not bald How would you describe their hair Curly Curly hair What color Black Black or dark brown yes very good All right so we see that Now when we think about these bunnies another question I asked you is this look at the picture If they had ten offspring what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like The fur in what respect that was the question Nathan what do you think 25 would be white 25 would be black the remainder would be gray with a little white So part of them will be black and part of them will be white So half of them will be gray Okay so here s what we have I m going to use abbreviations and 50 will be gray Nathan says that because one parent is white one s black they ll combine to form a gray color just like mixing paint in art class Any other predictions What else are you thinking Let s hear from somebody new What else do you think Omar I think 40 of the bunnies are going to be black are going to be half black and half white like a black bunny with white dots or a white bunny with black dots All right So you re saying 40 black 40 white You will see both colors We ll see black and we ll see white Why did you choose 40 40 and 20 Because I think that it s rare for bunnies to have dots It might be rare for them to have dots Okay so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely the probability is higher for a solid color So that s why you chose 20 Great great thinking Great explanation Sean what do you think I had 20 white and the rest are gray I would have said 25 but you can t have two and a half babies being white Okay All right so you would ve said 25 So you were thinking similarly Yeah Why do you say 20 20 and 60 Because most of them would be a mixture of the two but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit s traits Okay so because they have offspring the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits So mom and dad will blend together to create gray but some of them will look just like the father some will look just like the mother so some will be black some will be white Great One more idea Kasey what do you think I know in health that everyone has a dominant feature I think white is so that the majority so like 40 would be white and 20 would be black and then the rest would be gray 40 white 20 black and 20 gray And you said because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe That s only 80 Oh what did you say for the last one I said the rest Wow well thanks for paying attention Good check there guys It would be 40 60 we need 40 Did you say 40 I said the rest I was just making up too many different numbers Well I m so happy that you guys are paying attention I m going to tell your math teacher good job Okay 40 white but here s what Kasey said that was really good She said that 40 will be white because white is dominant You used that word You talked about that in health a little bit So let s talk about dominant and what that means What does it mean What do you think dominant means And be nice and loud for us John Most of Most of Good What do you think Sam Main Main Sean The majority The majority Alex Beat out all others Beat out all others Nice What do you think Sean Strongest Okay Let me show you a little example here So where do we get our traits first of all Where do we get traits From parents From where Parents Your parents Okay it s passed down Traits are passed down and some come from each parent right Dominant recessive some come from both mom and dad If you received a dominant trait See I labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait So half and half mom and dad They come together which trait do you see The dominant one or the recessive one The dominant one The dominant one What if I put it this way Which trait do you see The dominant one What if I put two recessive traits together The recessive The recessive okay Either way I pair them mom or dad dad or mom If I have two dominant traits that go together what do I see Dominant Dominant okay So if the dominant trait is present then finish the sentence If the dominant trait is present in your genes then what It will show It will show Kasey says That s right if the dominant trait is present it will show Are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro Okay let s check this then real quick Yesterday you filled out this concept map Let s make sure that your answers are correct Jsut take a look So read this with me Genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits from parent to offspring and if the offspring has the same alleles we call that Purebred And if they have different alleles Hybrid What that means allele that word say that allele Allele It s the fun word to say during our genetics unit That s the form of the gene so is it a dominant or is it a recessive Okay so let s go back here Genetics is the study of Heredity The passing of Traits I don t hear everybody Controlled by Genes Made of Alleles Say it again Alleles Alleles So genes made of Alleles Shows when present We call that Dominant And can be masked Recessive Recessive all right very good Any questions on the concept map Any corrections if you need to make them please do so All right Well let s get going with our lab Are you guys ready Okay please take out your lab paper We re going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on Notice the top of the paper It says Problem This is what we re trying to solve This is the point of our scientific investigation Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles I d like you on the lines to create your own hypothesis or your prediction for this Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common that s the question are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles So write down what you think write down your prediction If you can write it in the if then format of how we do hypotheses that s preferred but if that confuses you at this point just write what you think is going to happen Are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles Whatever you think it s your thinking We will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment So once you ve written down your hypothesis reread it and make sure that it answers the question Then we re going to get to work using our clickers which i ll explain in just a moment I d like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin The question again Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles Please share your prediction your hypothesis Ronnie I said yes because dominant alleles it shows over recessive alleles So you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles Okay great Girls one of you share your hypothesis for me Who would like to share Everyones looking at you Kate What do you have on your paper I said that I thought the dominant alleles were more common You believe the dominant alleles will be more common Okay great thank you Another one Alex I agreed with it I said that I believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive because there s more combinations to get dominant one s over recessive You believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive because there s more combinations To get that To get to that To get the dominant traits to show Good One more Matthew I said that the dominant traits are less common because in the picture with Danny DeVito His son and daughters didn t look much like him Okay so you believe that the dominant traits are less common because in the example of Danny DeVito his kids didn t look much like him Yeah and how your younger brother is 6 4 And how my younger brother is 6 4 but he s taller than the rest of my family Okay so you re making connections to our earlier conversation good We re going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab 
 Let s talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company Let s start with T Shirts R Us Okay who can explain to me what s going on with T Shirts R Us Devon You have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt Okay so you ve got to pay And then what do you pay per shirt Six Six dollars per shirt Okay what are the advantages of that How is this one in some way better than top of the line Allegra what s better about this company You only have to pay six dollars per shirt You only have to pay six dollars per shirt So you re telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt Right Okay what s the disadvantage to this plan Who can tell me the disadvantage to this one Sarah You have to pay 50 dollars first You have to pay 50 dollars up front okay So if I were going to buy a lot of shirts let s say I was going to buy 200 shirts which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts Taylor I think the T Shirts R Us would be better because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt Yeah for this one the more shirts you buy the better deal it becomes right But for this one if you re not going to buy if we were only going to buy for say 10 people would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front Are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference Probably not okay So for top of the line tees our initial charge the nice thing about top of the line what s the advantage of top of the line They re eight dollars That it raise you hand Kevin They re only eight dollars They re already eight dollars but is that their advantage Yes No Patrick says no Patrick is their advantage that they re eight dollars per shirt What s the advantage for top of the line Isn t it because the design is free Is free so do we have to pay anything up front No No so if Cameron if you and I were the only people that wanted to get shirts that would probably be a good place to go right because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars but up here two shirts is going to be expensive right Right Yeah Yeah it would be over 60 dollars right 62 That s not a very good price for shirts okay Brett I kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn t really part of the data Okay Another thing I kind of thought whenever I was working on this last night was if they re charging money for the graphic couldn t it possibly be like a better graphic but It could be It doesn t necessarily mean that it is and I think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable maybe not identical but at least close okay All right So let s look at a couple of different things okay Let s start with these tables You guys have had a minute to look at these tables What the first question says which of the following tables represents T Shirts R Us With this being our given information which one of these tables is T Shirts R Us Tell me how you know Amanda The first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts Okay so Amanda says that this one is T Shirts R Us and how did you know that You explained that in a really interesting way How did you say that Because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts Yeah Amanda says this one has to be T Shirts R Us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars Do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars Yes Okay that s one way to say it Is there another way Lindsay you had something interesting on your paper What s the other way that we can tell whether or not that s T Shirts R Us I divided 30 divided by five equals six Can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five In t shirts there were a five dollar difference The t shirts goes up by five Yeah so this one goes up And the cost up by 30 And I just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars So she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five So then to figure out how much each shirt was she divided the 30 by six and figured out Oh no not by six 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt So one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change right and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost Like what is it that you have to pay up front So in this problem can we see both Can we look at this table and see here s what you have to pay up front and then here s what you have to pay per shirt Can you see that Yes Okay Write that down All right so look at the table and let s talk about the original question that we asked The original question that I asked you and this was just a pick Which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students T Shirts R Us What did you find out when you really really investigated Casey They re both 200 each You really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost 200 dollars 200 dollars So if we were just buying t shirts for our class would it matter which company we chose No No What if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students If we decided we wanted to do all of my math students which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100 Bree what do you think If we were going to buy t shirts for all 100 students because at 25 the cost is the same right Which one of these is going up more quickly The one on the left The one on the left s going up more quickly What do you think Nahla says she disagrees Nahla The one on the right is going up more quickly because it s going up by 40 Yeah this one s going up how much every five shirts 40 Yeah this one s going up 40 and at that same time this one s only going up 30 30 right Bree So Bree which one s going up faster The right one Yeah so they re the same here Do you guys see they re the same here You see that Bree But if this one s going up faster if I m going to buy a whole if I m going to buy a lot more shirts what s going to eventually happen with this one It will increase It s going to get increasingly more expensive okay So somebody summarize this for me What did we just figure out about tables What did we just explain about tables What can you find on tables Sierra tell me what we can find by looking at a table Y intercept We can definitely find the Y intercept Can you tell me how we can find the Y intercept When the X value is zero When the X value is zero that s going to be our Y intercept That was an excellent explanation Guys what else can we find from the graph We can find the Y intercept what else can we find Samantha We can find the slope We can find the slope and can you summarize how we found the slope We found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run Yeah we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run Excellent job okay So that s tables Cameron question Is it okay on the table where it says like t shirts in the columns is it okay to put x and y over them Cameron if that helps you understand it then yes that s completely fine But you need to understand that x and y represent something Right It s okay for you to think about it as x and y but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t shirts and y represents cost okay That s a good question All right now let s look at the graph Okay suppose these two graphs were given to you Okay look at the graph Is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph s set up Does the scale set look the same Yeah The x axis is identical and the y axis is identical So let s talk about the graph for a second Look at the graph Adam can you look at that graph and tell me which thing which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line The one on the right The one on the right Can you tell me why because top of the line keep in mind the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt How did you pick this one to be top of the line Because it started at zero Okay so one of the things that s important was that you realized it started at zero So he looked at this and recognized that my he said starts at zero Okay That s important How else could we figure out that that was how else could we figure that out Allegra I said that since it was five times eight well that s the first coordinate it would be Oh okay so the first coordinate was five 40 so you said five times eight is 40 40 okay what about this one That is 80 10 times eight is 80 Okay is that an interesting way of thinking about it Yes And does that also work Does that make sense with this problem Starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars so she said five times eight 10 times eight and that pattern would work all the way up Is there other ways that I could identify that this is top of the line Amanda I went down there on the table that the rate of the pulse goes up faster Uh Huh so like when you said how Did you guys here the word she used to describe that She said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate Do you guys agree with that The line s more steep Yeah the line has greater steepness is the word you used steep right Yeah so this one not only does it start at zero so we can recognize it that way but we also recognize that it s going up more quickly This one s going up eight dollars each shirt and this one s only going up six dollars each shirt because let s look at the rate of change for this one If we went from zero to five that went over five right And then from 50 up to 80 is what 30 That s from 50 to 80 is 30 30 and so 30 over five gives me how much Six Six per shirt okay Nahla you had your hand up Yeah Go ahead I was gonna say that I understand that it started at 50 So that would be T Shirts R Us So if that was T Shirts R Us then the other one had to be top of the line Guys did you hear what Nahla said Nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50 so because that one started at 50 it had to be what T Shirts R Us T Shirts R Us okay So so what re we talking about We re talking about looking at a graph and finding two things What are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph Greg tell me one Slope We need to do our final slope Emanuel tell me the other one The Y We need to be able to find the slope and the y intercept okay Emanuel can you summarize for me how to find the y intercept How do you look at a graph and find the y intercept Where the line crosses the y axis Where the line crosses the y axis So Sierra told us when we re on our table we re looking for where the x is zero The x is zero but on the graph that means that it crosses the y axis Okay nice Can somebody tell me from a graph how to find slope Stella I haven t heard from you for a minute How do we find slope from a graph You use the slope triangle You use the slope triangle Uh huh Then it leads your eyes for example can we talk about this one It doesn t matter you pick whichever one you d like So it will be the rise and speed it s going up Yeah so this is our rise okay And the run is how far it s going out And the run is how far it s going out It s rise over run And then you write it as a ratio rise to run okay Excellent Guys I have one final question on the graph So we picked these we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right And for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six right Would it matter if I did went too far I think Would it matter if I did that No I heard no Can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that s no So why does it not matter Sydney Because it s the same shape it s just larger It s a similar figure So I guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it it would be the same Did you guys hear what Sydney said Sydney used the word similar or used the phrase similar figures What do similar figures mean What does that mean Greg Like two figures that have the like they re they don t exactly have to be the same size It s like basically a dilation of the other It s essentially a dilation Okay so the first one we did went up 30 over five Right Well what about the red one The red one went from five to 20 How much did it go over if it went from five to 20 Cameron 15 It went over 15 So if this one goes over 15 you sort of used that word dilation right What s the scale factor from five to 15 Positive 3 That s times by positive 3 right So likewise what should this be If my run was 15 what should my rise be Raise your hand if you know Jaylynn 90 It should be 90 Okay so let s check and see if it is So we went from five so that went 15 and then we went from 80 up to 170 Now what s the difference from 80 to 170 80 to what 80 to 170 I don t know That s okay What s the difference Who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170 Sierra 90 The difference is 90 So if I looked at those two ratios so if I looked at those two ratios one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five Are those equal Yep Yes that is let s check it Are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt Yes Yeah so how do we find slope from a graph Taylor said we make the slope triangle and does it matter which triangle you pick Nope No because they should be proportional They should be dilations of one another Okay it be a good reference to something that we learned Can you show us how to start out like the first one Or the first few pages So the question was do you have to start out at the first one No Sydney why no Because if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars then you don t have to Unlike the other one it started at zero Mm hm Are you talking about the final slope Nahla Yes Okay Nahla you can start at the first point but you don t have to because if it s linear should the pattern ever change No So if the pattern never changes does it matter which two points you pick No Any two exact points you pick should still give you the same rate of change That was a great question Okay all right So now this is a different one So on the last one I gave you the verbal Right I did I said T Shirts R Us and gave you the verbal expression This time I m not giving you that This time we ve got a third t shirt company The third t shirt company Tee Time they explain to us this is their function cost Cost is equal to 4 50x plus 25 My question is what does that mean Who can tell me what it means to do 4 5x plus 25 Samantha start me We would charge and 4 50 per each t shirt Okay so what do we have to pay no matter what Patrick what is the one thing we have to pay If we ordered a shirt what s the one thing they re going to charge us For the design They re going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design right But then Each time Huh Each time Well that s a great question Do they charge us 25 dollars every time That s a great great great great great question No why not What s the 25 dollars for It s for the design on every shirt It s for the design and that is the design that we re going to use for all of our shirts So that s an important question Does the y intercept explain anything about change Will the y intercept change Will it move up or down No the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is okay That was a great question Who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like What would the graph look like It looks like a zero but I think it d start at 25 here It would start at 25 So it s go to start somewhere right in here okay And I m not sure why those numbers are on the table but they shouldn t be there Okay but that s okay We can move forward from it We can do this What should the cost be initially 25 The cost should initially be 25 dollars okay Then if we buy five shirts how can we figure that out Who can tell me how to figure that out Ah You can plug in the value of five in the equation thing You can plug into the equation Ooh I know what we can use Oh we can use I heard somebody say this earlier We can use a calculator right Where would I put this information in the calculator Y equals I d go to y equals excellent Okay and I put it in there my function Right so I ve got 4 50x plus 25 And then you press second Yeah what am I trying to look at I m trying to look at my table Let s go back for just a second Look at the table that s already given to us What do they do in their table It increases by five They increase their x values by five So do I want to set mine up to go by fives Yes Yeah so how do didn t I how do I set up a table Where do I do that It s a second and it s on top of a window Yeah it s second and it s on top of a window we ve got a table set up Where do we want to start our table What s the first number we need Five Okay because we already know zero right And then how much do we want to increase each time Five We want to increase each time by fives okay Are we okay with that Now where do I go to actually have the calculator give me the information Sydney where do I go You press second and then you press the graph button Second graph which will give me the table So I will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected because I m going to need you to help me with mine I don t know why I put the wrong table up there Okay we good All right so we used the calculator to help us get our table What was it in fives Who can help me with this Help me with this Cameron real quick 47 5 That s 47 5 or 47 50 right What about tens 70 
 Okay So if you re having trouble seeing it you can go back in with a regular pencil brush Visible enough for you You can go back in and make it lighter But right now the mark makings you re doing is really good As you want to turn if you re having trouble making curved lines you can turn Oh okay All right that helps Instead of turning the tool turn the plate and keep pulling towards you Okay It might make it a little bit easier to make those curves Yeah they re really tough to do Other than that it s been fine Good Is that working now that you what we talked about yesterday with this little Yeah shadow I thought it was kind of Okay And the same thing that I just told Kim if you re having trouble with the curved lines you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve All right but so far what you re doing is good You re adding all these different values Continue with that type of texture on the edges because that s working I m just going That s okay Be patient Have you decided yet how you re gonna treat this area in here No I m probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing Okay so adding a different texture Are you leaving the text I never I forgot to reprint it so if I do decide You ll just have to reverse the text Yeah I know and I ll right add it in That s fine I think I ll just decide it later Yeah finish your whole overall design first Yes exactly And then if you want the text in it as long as it s reversed so you print it the right way Yeah You can just reprint it Okay sounds good Awesome Yeah So you re just Yeah All right the way you re doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it s consistent Do I have to make it identical No Well what do you think Are these identical persons It s like supposed to be but I know I m not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but I think it would look fine if it was different I kinda want it to look a little messy You want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one I don t think there s anything wrong with making them separate I know that they re trying to be echoing each other symmetrically Yeah But all of the textures can be different Okay to add some interest to it I think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side Right Don t you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway Yeah definitely That s good How did you decide that you re going to treat the inside of the mouth area Are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light Well there s supposed to be some tongue over here but over here I m gonna make it like I m gonna try to go solid black in some parts Like I tried to do that inside the mouth Yeah That s good That s good I want mine to seem So then all of those areas then will stay dark Yeah It ll create a nice shadow Excellent that s really good Are you gonna go off the edge Yeah Nice that s really good Keep it up And Emily how s yours coming Yeah the same thing All those little dark areas that you re working on inside in between teeth now that you ve carved out all that area it s gonna create a darkened tone And as I mentioned before all the different stippling areas that s really good It s adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure If you re finding that it s easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table Okay Good good This is good I m getting confused of where I m going because if I did the backgrounds this is the negative space that I do the crosshatching Then it would have to continue down here So you want to decide all the different types of textures that you re using in between all of it Yeah All right so you ve got a little bit of the crosshatching here okay and you re using illustrative lines over here So you wanna try and find something in between that s a little bit different Right Uh huh Well you haven t done any stippling texture yet I was working on In here Okay so in here s gonna be stippling So right then this can t be the stippling because it s gonna be next to it I was thinking of here kind of moving this pattern down and then maybe just sort of Okay I think that would be a good solution to that It s like this area in the background Okay Now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid And then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid Then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture you can go back into it and add it again Okay Okay so in here like you said follow the movement of these objects Okay this is all the chain inside the bike So following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture And then in here just because you have all this texture in here you might not need to put anything else there Okay What s your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra Yeah it s hard to tell because I m not sure how it s gonna look when it s printed but I think that might be good Because it would get kind of crazy I think it might be nice to have And you wanna still have it have a focal point So if you go crazy with other textures in here you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work Okay I m having a hard time seeing it so you I might need to get one of those blue sheets Okay The blue sheets are working I think you know what Emily s been using the table So maybe that helps her to see her white lines That has been helping So if you don t wanna use one of those blue sheets you can do what she s doing and use the table Yeah I ll do that I think I wanna lift it off of the book So you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines Okay Okay You re still working on your design right Yeah I think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon Yeah Because once you figure out what s going on over here Yeah I just have to Yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong So what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas Are you gonna fill them in too Yeah I think so Okay then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it engraving it I don t know I don t know if I should do really fine crosshatching Mm hmm But then should I put a new texture on these What do you think Do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print Because I think if I texture both of them it ll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture Okay so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first you can decide If they re too solid then you can go back in with a different texture Okay Okay So finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later Okay Room 221 Students enter through a small entryway To their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom This classroom is shared by two teachers Storage space is limited In this room I teach three sections of Photography Advanced Placement Studio Art and Advanced Placement Art History As we open up into the main part of the classroom storage areas are visible for each class photographic prints a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives As I pan the room you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible Bulletin boards are set up for project instructions visual examples and critique displays Along the back of the room is a dry mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout Hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements Cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies In the center of the room the printing press is stored for AP Studio Art and set up to allow for safe and organized used Along the right hand side of the room there is a drawing rack for students to store work in progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives There is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents The file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders The large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies And at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept And at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use The projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions Some of you are ready to print so I wanted to go through the actual printing press process today Some of you might even be ready to try that today If you re not ready to try it right after I do the demonstration you can go back to your etching or engraving and then by tomorrow you ll be able to run it through the press Before I do that I wanted to share something with you that s a little exciting and the fact that I actually have a relative who was a professional engraver My grandfather was an engraver He started in the 1930s and 40s After World War II he was part of something called the GI Bill Does anybody know what that is Oh I do Yeah what is it They pay people to go to college Yes exactly Yeah After the World War II veterans came back from war the government paid for them to go to college And he went to a college called The Art Students League which I was just talking with Alex about and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver I m going to pass some of these around These are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you You can take some of those So you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time A hundred years at least or even more But this is from the early 30s and 40s these engravings And these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that I explained that we don t do here because of the safety You re doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid So I m going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that I m passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we re working with today And it s kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this So I m going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him All right so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print making ink So for the most part we re going to start with black today but you can choose any color that you want So you can see some of the examples that I put up here from past students One student decided instead of putting black ink on the white ground he used white ink on black ground So that s another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process So all the steps that we re going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week It s going to remind you of all the steps So the first step after you ve beveled all the edges in your plate that I demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print making ink And all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you re ready You ll take a little bit of print making ink and put it on the plate like this Just like that And you ll use a tool called a brayer And the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate So once your brayer is filled with the ink you ll apply it to the plate And I m actually using my grandfather s plate from several years ago All right so you ll gently apply the ink over the entire plate Okay just take a seat and I ll hand it out All right And after you have the entire plate inked you ll check and make sure that you didn t miss any spots All right notice that I missed a spot there so I m going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered Once you have all the areas covered And this is just in interest of time I ll just show you the next step Once the entire plate is covered you ll take a small piece of mat board I ll just use this instead Okay I have little pieces of mat boards for you Okay so you re going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that I have cut up here After you apply the entire ground with ink you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that s going to be on your inside lines This has a dual purpose It removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate This has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you re done This will push all the ink in the surface Okay and then once you get most of it removed then you can take the cheesecloth I found one of my mat boards Here we go All right so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink And then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front This will lift the ink off pretty easily And after you do this process This is the messy process so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you re done with this before we move to the printing press I ll show you how to do that Sometimes a circular motion with this will help So I m going to show so you can all see Circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface I m showing you this quickly all the steps but I have one prepared for us to print with Just like a cooking show so it s ready to go All right so you re going to use Flat on the table I m showing you this so you can see it but you re going to do all of this flat at your desk Get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth If you run out of space you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again Then the last step before you clean your edges At this point if you want to go clean your hands so you don t get it on anything again you could go clean your hands as well We ll take a piece of newsprint a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper The newsprint works the best so I have cut up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice smooth surface And before you re ready to print you could take a Q tip dip it in some water and then clean your edges So the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates you should take the Q tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean So this print was left up here for a reason It doesn t have a clean edge I wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn t clean their edge Okay this has a nice clean edge This has a little bit of ink left on the edge So when you pull a perfect print you want to make sure you have a clean edge And the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off 
 Let s go Okay Continue Yes All right scholars here s my question What do you think actually let me start by quoting the passage So it says they can either trust or predict what Chacko s attitude would be and they were trying to hide that get rid of it all before Chacko returned So what do you think Chacko s opinion of all of this chaos would be Could you just be particular with the chaos you were talking about What s that The entire situation the steamy love affair and the reaction on Baby Kochamma s part And Mammachi s part Got it I don t think he d be happy about the love affair cause as it says it s like she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one blessed personally by the Patriarch of Antioch Antioch an imperial entomologist and Rhodes Scholar from Oxford so it s like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long and just thrown it out the window I m gonna have to disagree with that Becca I mean I think that Chacko is a liberal type He is very progressive he s a Marxist he didn t allow his father to beat his mother as most Indians Traditionalists probably would be OK with I think that Chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if some guy was having an affair with his sister As a social ideal I think he would be fine with everything I agree because I feel like oh God I had this whole plan of something to say and I can t remember Sorry No it s not your fault Well what is the only thing that made Chacko upset at Mammachi Was it that she abandoned her children Oh I got it Yeah I feel like the most of this passage though it s third person narration it really feels like it s coming out of Baby Kochamma s mouth and it s like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff The whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black To quote the passage once again So I feel like that all really Baby Kochamma s words and not necessarily Baba s beliefs and I feel like they have really contrasted beliefs Yeah I mean I feel like all the diction you were talking about for instance when it says Mammachi s rage at the old one eyed Paravan standing in the rain drunk dribbling and covered in mud And it repeats mud a lot and I think it s that s just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they re trying and almost like mud covers things up So it s almost like it should be covered up And they were trying to cover it up But don t you feel like they used Chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do Oh he s coming back so we have to do this They kind of use him as the excuse to do it Well it s sort of like Chacko could intervene and so we have to do it now so we can t miss our chance to do it again I think that s important actually I think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here It wasn t their fault when the whole thing spun like a deranged top I think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie In the movie for example when Mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if Kayani gets married but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around I think that s this book and movie is really trying to say is this is what happens when you set up rules and don t adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change I ll just go In the fourth paragraph they talk about having a plan It s very orderly and they said that Kochu Maria was a midget lieutenant They had this very organized and planned out even though in the second paragraph she shuddered with a school girl shudder It s like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff Yeah on that I really want to say cause it says school girl shudder at the beginning And then it back in the fourth paragraph when it s talking about their plan they re referred to as the two old ladies So that s contrasting in a way to be described which obviously it s important Yeah I think that s one of the themes of the passage Conflicts between age and which one is ultimately I don t want to say better but a better advantage I guess Like in authority Between age and youth you mean Between old and young Yeah age and youth Which one can have a better life according to them They also play with age When they locked Ammu up it s kind of like putting her in time out like they tricked her in to her room which is also a parallel I saw in the movie when they locked Kalyani up so she couldn t get married It was to keep them from doing stuff I just want to bring up another theme of the passage Where it s the very beginning where it s before we are completely ruined by the It kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs what you do In this society at least affects everybody around you And it kind of contrasts Ammu s individualism with what societal hierarchy and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy so they have authority over her and so they re telling her not to do this And they re presenting their authority over her And Chacko s even higher than them just cause he s a guy When the passage lists the life cycle events the weddings the funerals baptisms and birthday parties it says for generations to come so I feel like what Peter was saying it affects all of society That also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people The funerals are when you die The baptisms are when you are just born So it s saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life that s how profound it is And even that sentence that Peter was talking about before it goes any further Before we are completely ruined I think that s also just family selfishness because they re just projecting what her the consequences of her actions will be for them Not necessarily for her And in the movie where the leader of that house of she s just really concerned about herself She ll sacrifice all of the other women just so she s comfortable But does she also use a we I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti say the same thing We re gonna be ruined by this We we we In regards to that I think In water you know how all the widows they sorta put them together and they sort of create this unity It s all out of despair because they all lost something In a sense Mammachi lost her former love and so did Ammu Ammu had babies without It wasn t a formal tradition The way she had her babies And so in a sense she has She s in grievance and so those two aspects unites these women Yeah they re all widows Yeah they re all widows and that really But does that give them right to be Oh understand that s why I feel like it says we Not we like our family but more of like we women who are widowed Austin what do you think Do you think that gives them the right to because they ve also lost and because Baby Kochamma and Mammachi has also experienced trauma so that also means Diti as well Her husband died when she was young Does that give them the right to take that I don t think so cause that was actually one of my questions Especially when it says Her tolerance immense needs as far as her son was concerned became the fuel for unimaginable fury at her daughter And then just my question was is Baby Kochamma s actions motivated by Indian society or her own emotions So I don t think that they should be able to from their past experience take it out on everybody else I think that what we re talking about right now maybe be reason that Ghandi appears at the end of the film Because Ghandi as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism And it s when he shows up nice Diti sees that may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain Ghandi s existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women I think that Ghandi in the movie represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once Ghandi takes power The widows will gain power The untouchables won t be untouchable anymore They ll gain more rights So I think they look at him as not really rationalism because some people think that he s just crazy The Brahmin caste don t see him as rational so I think it s more of a hope in an idealized society Building off of what she said how Ghandi represents re birth I think coincides with the movie s title Water For me at least the way I saw it I felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie They washed themselves it was washing away their sins Being reborn I thought who s the girl The one who killed herself Kalyani I thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself Because the way she was killing herself she was submersing herself in water and I thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff she in a sense she was clearing away her sins And so she would go to the next life sinless I think that the drowning of Kalyani parallels to how Sophie Mol drowned How it s like the innocent life was taken by the water Which isn t really innocence too But was Kalyani innocent I think that if she hadn t been forced to do things she would have been she didn t feel right about what she had done I m gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way in both the movie and the book It says the fisherman had already found Sophie Mol She They drowned trying to cross the river and Kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who Norian really is The river is important in both works It s an inescapable wall So I don t think water is portrayed as a good image I mean it could possibly be both I think Peter made a pretty good point about it Sam did with Kalyani s death and Sophie Mol s death But I think it could be both I think it s a duality thing And then going on combining what both ya ll said where you said it s an inescapably and the way they view it as washing away their sins View it as a cleansing thing also for example emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs And they re cleaning themself in this if water is just viewed a symbol they re cleaning themselves with something that s bad I also don t think that They depend on the water too to get their food from it They wash themselves in it Yet it s also it creates this it s something that the Paravans are trying to overcome A lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier but they depend on it They still need it So it s contrasting what they believe Just like a duality thing Yeah It s the family and God s talkings Their immediate family They depend on each other because when you re a child you have to have an older figure to help you grow up But they are also They cause the turmoil with each other They create their own problems pretty much It s like you can t live with them but you can t live without them Susan did you have a question Yes I did Well a lot of them are about similarities between characters But one thing that I thought about was how Norian dealt with his lover s loss and how Velutha was able to deal with being separated from Ammu And do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations Sorry I missed all this So she I heard Well Norian because he was a Brahmin the highest caste I think he said we ll either going to Calcutta or India to start his life You mean Kolkata Or I m sorry or England To become a lawyer So he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education and he could provide for himself Velutha was an untouchable so he had no opportunity 
NFL Yeah So here s like you can see that the professional players who can pay that money They re really rich so there s so much sponsors that they pay for their helmets But like in high school football what they want is long pass cheaper material So they don t care much about The health about the guys they want to go just Their problem is the money of the helmets How much cost of helmet is like helmets with Kevlar or that stuff like they use in the military equipment So how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can save these thoughts So what kind of ideas you guys have How could you design a helmet so it s not this big or really neat and super expensive The type of padding we use So what ideas do you guys have So what kind of So you play football What kind of padding right now is inside of the helmet I mean they re not soft It s like it s air glove It s almost like a hard balloon stuck to your head So it s just one on the side and the whole top is full and one on the other side and one in the back But that s it I mean you could actually feel the hit But it you just don t get a concussion unless you re heavy So have you ever been hit Have you ever had a helmet to helmet contact So where did you get hit My head Almost like right here On top of your head Right but there s padding there Oh but you said you could still feel it I mean I could feel it for like a quick couple of seconds or so Then it just goes away It s because of the padding I guess It s umm It s like So is there any way that you would change the design of the helmet that you have now Um more cushion Okay So that s kind of going back to what Angel was talking about So how can we change the design to make it more cushiony but Because if you have something that s too cushiony right is that going to decrease the time or increase the time and decrease the force if it s really cushiony Oh that s really cushiony Yeah Oh you mean like it will just go Yeah No Right So you re saying you want it more cushiony you re saying you want it cheaper you re saying you want it smaller I think like what Matt s kind of saying is more for comfort than for safety Right Right So why So can you relate sort of to what Angel s saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous Umm with the head rattling Like if it hits on this side it s quicker to hit the other side Is that what you mean what So how So think about how the padding is right now How it s stiff compared to something that kind of gave So think about relating this back to force times the change in time You can ask If it s built too soft it s going to hit you with a stronger force So what could happen to the time It s going to be slower it s going to be faster It s going to be faster so what s going to happen to the force The force is going to increase So it s going to hurt even more and it will be more dangerous So what you need is like a stable material that not too soft but at the same time So besides Kevlar which you brought up which is I was thinking like like for example when you are hit and you re hit you want that like bulletproof that the force spreads in all the space of the body of the helmet So is you are hit here all the force is not concentrated in this place but is moving over all the helmet So it displaces the force so it s not on one area So I was like thinking like maybe like this big the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits it spreads to all the helmet So that s you versus less you spread all the force on your head so you have like less Something that will transfer the motion Yeah I like this idea But what I was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something cushiony on the outside so that it takes time for you to hit the helmet And once you hit the helmet the small cushiony so that it takes time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again and then hit you So kind of like an atmosphere Yeah it will have like little layers It will probably have to make the helmet a little bit like bigger But not like Don t make it like huge but have layers on there and then incorporate his idea when you re making waves So something like that first layer could help dissipate the force So we have cushiony against cushiony like boxers use And then they have the hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping So we have the cushiony part first So it s going to take time and I think that s what they use They put cushion on there so that it takes time for you to actually feel the force So that the force will be less And if you have cushion with cushion It s because you are increasing the time Yeah because if you have two helmets that are hitting each other that are cushion and cushion it will take longer for them to hit each other And then the force will be decreased My question for Matt is How big is the helmet Oh The padding It s like thick It s kind of thick That s just the padding and then you have the helmet which is like that much more Yeah It s like that thick How heavy is the helmet Like when you re wearing it does it feeling like it s weighing you down Yeah it takes time to get used to it And that day you re neck will hurt That s how heavy it is Another version of like what we are trying to do I think it d also be cool Maybe like helmet were like it was fitted to like the head and then it d have like inbetween kind of like a net structure which is a part of uh kind of like what he had but something that is hung I want to kind of imagine it like the bridges How they have like a whole bunch of little columns But just a whole bunch that is attached to the outside of the helmet I will draw it and I ll show you guys You had your hand up do you want to share while he Yeah I was wondering since we re talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the type of brain damage that you can get Just like an actual name Like I heard concussion Other injuries other names Can you tell What a concussion is What is a concussion Ask the group Well a concussion is when It s when you your brain between your actual brain and your skull There is a liquid like Spinal fluid is it and that s supposed to cushion your brain from touching the or hitting your skull But a concussion is when it s hitting and it s going back and forth I mean gradually it will go back to normal but That s my understanding of concussion And you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest areas of the impact So what part do you think is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain on your brain The sides What do the sides control Well it wasn t like that I thinking like in the structure of the of the skull So the sides where the nerves enter like Your optic nerves Yeah So I think that s like less pain It s like a really big hit here can kill a man So I think that hit is worst You re saying the skull is thinnest right there Yeah It s not as thick as the other parts It s thickest like right here What does your frontal lobe control So that s what kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most developed frontal lobe And then on the sides is more of your sensory stuff and then in the back is your actually your Occipital lobe for your eyes is in the back a long with your movement your cerebellum So different spots that s why you have padding here and here and back here is to protect all sides of the brain So a concussion is just like your brain keeps vibrating basically after the blow So I like to think about it and I meant to bring this in and I apologize So if you have Think about your Tupperware and inside the Tupperware you have an egg You just cracked a nice egg inside and then you shake it So imagine that egg is your brain And that Tupperware is your skull So the harder you rattle it what s going to happen to the egg It will break It s gonna break right The yolk s going to break right I mean your brain doesn t really break But you can think that It s just kind of the movement Because if you think about what does Newton s first law say An object that s in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by outside force So if the brain If you get hit here which way is your brain going to go That way Until it hits the skull and then it s going to thunk So that s what they call rattling your cage I was thinking of like when I play baseball when I swing the bat and I hit the ball and my hands keep like I can feel it inside and like even after a minute it will keep rattling So now take that and think about how that would Okay So David can you uh Explain what you have so we can This is kind of like the bridge idea that I had where like there s like different columns that go around like the frame So in this it would kind of be like the head goes right here and the helmet s right here And these would be like some kind of material that s bendable So when something hits it they would bend in so to absorb kind of the impact Kind of like a cage in the racing cars Like how racing cars have a cage inside of them Just in case they roll over the cage still protects the person Yeah kind of No but Yeah kind of like that but these are like cushions Yeah So they absorb the momentum So like a coil Like for your bed The bed spring that when you jump up on it you rebound back so Wouldn t that be more dangerous if it s elastic Yeah it s elastic and when we did the little cars When it was elastic it completely transferred all of its momentum to the other car So when you get hit it will just like swing and then all the momentum will hit you instead of both of you sharing it So if you share it d probably be better But I don t know if that s Because I was also thinking of mattresses A little sleep mattresses and how they talked about the coils and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger over here than over here and then they have the new ones now that are like foam The Tempurpedic ones Yeah So I was thinking also if you like spread out where the momentum goes Saying if you spread out where it won t be in one certain area Then you won t get hit really hard right here And if you get hit hard like over here it d probably be better than getting hit hard just right there Yeah It will probably be less of a force So when they design like a helmet they ve got one piece thing where it s like your body their shoulder pads connected to their helmet So your body absorbs some of that too instead of just your head So that depends how you turn your head And would it be good if your body have you guys ever heard that people who are like drunk drivers they kind of walk away from a car crash and it s the passengers or the victims are the ones that get hurt the most So think about what s different between their body in motion and the other person s body in motion So they re looser right They re not tightening their muscles compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact We flex right Just waiting for it and so by being more rigid your body doesn t move You re trying to fight against the motion So you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that Because you It hurt your body more because you re trying to fight against what you re body is actually going to do instead of the other person who s just like really loose is moving with it so there s not as much impact Well I ve been playing football and how you play like you want to win You hit someone you want to After that you re still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like I know What he is saying is like if you see someone about to collide with you you want to hit him back instead of Yeah Why is that Related that to momentum Because momentum is vector right So you have to think about the direction and of the way that things are moving So think back to When we were playing with different cars So you had the greater mass in one car going this way And had the smaller mass going this way Right So what would you want to do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the Raise his speed Increase the speed right And so by knowing that you re going to get hit you re going to run a little faster So then what was the what is the ending result there So like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass Mean like how do you think is like Inelastic I don t know like So what s going to happen Are they going to stay stuck together So it s elastic so it comes off right Think about it like a rubber band an elastic rubber band You can stretch it so elastic is is saying something that s going to rebound whereas inelastic you re just rigid There is no motion I guess you should say I thought that was inelastic when you hit something it will both go off completely and elastic it will stick together And inelastics magnets 
 Counting on that I agree with AJ but also I think that What I want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what AJ was saying it s good to have a backup just in case you want it And we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there So we know that so we re having other people work with it but the problem is is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that What if they messed up What if they blow up or do something wrong And if they re not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there s gonna be a lot more problems and if it s not able to do the same things that s going to be completely bad too Okay Eric said Go up to fix things What would be some things that we would need to make sure that we re going up to maintain in space Just to kind of follow up International Space Station Okay International Space Station Some of the satellites we have in orbit Okay satellites that do what for us Television and communication Okay Ms McCall what s that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares You can just write Sun Probe Sun probe That s fine Excuse me while I turn this on And the Hubble Hubble s gone a lot longer than they expected it to so if it breaks we d want to repair it Especially since we don t have a new one Alana I know how Mer was talking about the risks like with the Challenger and that was really devastating but I remember the wife whose husband died on Challenger She said that he knew the risks That s part of being an astronaut and being in NASA and willing to go up there and you re risking your life It s not like they went in there totally blind about that I think that s kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now We have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that I say go for it Okay Blanca and then Megan I get what she s saying with they risked their lives but you re also risking the money and time that everyone has put into it They spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space And like the Challenger it just exploded and they didn t even really get that far just for one minor error And I don t think they should cut all the way like they were saying Have it just when you need it but it s still a lot of money that our country doesn t really have right now so maybe it s not the most important thing and there s other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that We ll go Megan then Bieber So you know how we re paying Russia to fly up to the International Space Station I think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station Because then we have more funding for NASA and then we have a shuttle Then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to Russia to fly up there I feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up not for free but we can fly up with the United States and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in They can pay us for it and then we get the money Okay Bieber you need to sit close Eli then we ll go Rachel I don t know what color to show but Russia s not making a profit off of us riding up there They re just trying to cover their costs It s not like we ll be doing good business ferrying people to the International Space Station It s not like a tourist attraction or anything It s pretty bland up there Russia s just trying to pay to get us up there That s the cost of flying somebody there They re not making profit out of it Okay good that s a downpoint Rachel I agree with what Eli said and also people were talking earlier about jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs And I think I read somewhere that they created 25 000 jobs or something like that But if you think about it if there s 300 million people that s still less than 1 of the population So while it seems like a big number it s still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else Especially with the economy so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on NASA on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on NASA and spending billions of dollars Amber then Clark I was going to say I kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now Any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now at this point in time So I don t think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that s also putting a lot of people out of work Clark The statistics with the jobs created are probably from when NASA was being used a lot and now that it s been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut And I don t think in this economy people need jobs requiring that much education not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that People just need regular jobs in general So you re saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe And like in science and stuff and not everybody has that That s a downpoint Luis Going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things I found out that the funding for NASA only accounts for 0 7 of the US government spending I feel like if you just cut all of that that s not really going to make a huge difference when the government s spending 99 3 on other things We ll go Hallie then Troy Going back to the risk of sending people out into space I researched and I found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened As we re pushing for more people and more money we re actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back The risk is just becoming more and more That s an interesting point As we re slowly cutting back on the budgets already we re automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts Troy I actually support them cutting the budget because for one when they cut budget they re setting aside money to buy more space exploration from private companies Those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government which also stimulates the economy a lot more I mean if everybody s employed by the government like what could happen to Greece Okay Shannon hasn t spoken Bieber Kind of off of what Holly said with the risk and everything going up I did a little research and with NASA there was only a 4 1 fatality rate Out of something like 439 astronauts there have only been 18 deaths I feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut Okay so even with the budget cuts we re not seeing this huge increase Jillian A lot of people are making the points that it s only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles but at the same time I don t think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide put off by one shuttle launch It s 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it s killing the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone not just the people in the space shuttle So you re taking the environmental aspect Besides looking at costs besides looking at jobs there s this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide What is the issue associated with carbon dioxide Jillian The ozone layer depleted and global warming Thank you global warming Tyler To go along with what Luis said they only get 0 7 of the national spending but we also have gained more knowledge from NASA than any other government thing We can discover maybe how Earth is going to end and we can discover things that are more important than other government government spending So you re kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending We ll go Eli then Justin Also Luis said it doesn t account for very much of the US budget and if we cut that spending it s really not going to go to anything more productive Maybe more guns or something It s not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people It s just going to go to corporations and wars And then in regards to CO2 emissions does anyone know how much CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year Far more than a truck driver Cows and moose I think they can flirt over that I think that s just moose So you re making the comparison to say the idea that even though it s a human made craft if we look at natural sources of the CO2 emission And the relative frequency that a moose passes gas A space shuttle launch doesn t have that big of an effect on the environment Touche Anyone have a cup that hasn t spoken yet that wants to jump in real quick Justin Going off of what Tyler said if we stop funding NASA then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of Earth just doesn t allow us to see that far So it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future Interesting point Amber then Eric Besides everything about the jobs NASA has created a lot of things that have helped us today different technologies Like in someone s presentation they were saying something about they re creating lighter systems for firefighters and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff So there s a lot of technology that s been created because of NASA so I think it s benefited us a lot more than it hasn t helped us And so you re saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives It s not just useful for exploring many new things I forgot my order Was it Eric on that one I have a couple different connections One of them s with the cost Like they re saying it s 0 7 of the total budget but the thing is not only is it that low of a cost it s 14 billion just to give you an actual number It s 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of NASA This year just for this year alone To give you a comparison it s around 640 between 680 for the military budget That is 47 times more expensive Now you can say Well alright that s the military The thing is that first of all it has a lot higher mortality rate Second of all it s a lot less productive in general I mean we re pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet I m sorry but that s not very cool in general For one of those things we re trying to get a high fatality rate not for our side but the other side But the other thing is that for jobs creations if you want to create more jobs and you re going for a more positive feel you wouldn t decrease funding for NASA you would increase funding Because think about it If you increased it 47 times to the military I m pretty sure you d get a lot more than one million even a lot lot more than just one million jobs from NASA if you increased this funding a lot because imagine whole new planets Just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet and with seven billion people we can t hold that many people very long on this planet But there are so many other planets out there that we could easily fit everyone There s enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet That s how many planets there are So you re thinking planning for the future that it might be beneficial for us Holly As I was researching I found out that there s really no short term benefits and we re not guaranteed long term benefits Yes we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us We re not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from magnetic storms There might be some way we can save ourselves but we re not guaranteed that So you re saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into the factor We can keep researching but we may never find the answer Monique you got some info Yeah I think when Hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks we ve talked about what was up there The benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section We gain knowledge we need to study the sun probe and Hubble and International Space Station With jobs it provides a whole section of jobs having shuttles go up to space Not only that but they ve created new inventions through that and I think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital Going from there there s going to be more Not just stopping now So again tying in the cost benefit analysis that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs A J and then we ll go Alana I guess to counter what Troy said and what a few people have said when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money It s not just about the economy When you think about it NASA wasn t meant to help the economy at all and it wasn t meant for job creation even though it has employed so many people Through the research that I did there was a story from somebody that s going to be retiring just because he knows he d lose his job anyway He said that After 30 years this is all I know We re losing the most brilliant minds our country has because they just don t know what else to do NASA s been open for decades and that s their job Technicians and analysts they re not going to just become accountants or something There s nothing after NASA That s probably the highest most prestigious thing What do you do after that It s not like they re just going to fill minimum wage jobs which is what most people are looking for right now anyway if you re thinking about job creation It s a good point you have all these highly educated specialized people as A J points out Where are they going to go Are they going to be able to find jobs within our country Are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries It s a good point Alana then Troy I know we re talking a lot about the cost benefit and job creation but I want to go back to the safety and I have a question for everyone just to think about The main part in all the failed missions especially with the shuttle and the Challenger it s basically been human error You know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn t listen that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and everything but I ve been thinking what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human and the possible errors that we make Like robots we use robots to build half our cars and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate So do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make That s an interesting point We ll have to put that on the question board Troy what you got Kind of to counter what A J said these people are highly educated Minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least Companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now People that have highly specialized degrees they re really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance Those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees If you can do quantitative physics those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who s just a finance agent So your counterpoint is the idea that because they re so highly educated they will find some sort of a niche Yeah There s a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better Interesting Jillian Back to what Alana said if you re using robots to make it safer that s also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots If you re using robots as the engineers then you re having people lose jobs Interesting point So kind of a counterpoint to shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics there s some drawback association We ll go Rachel Going back to what Eric said a while ago he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget but I feel like the military helps a lot of people and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people because the military pays for a lot of people s education university and stuff I know a lot of people now since university is so expensive a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for So I feel like it should have a higher budget because it s creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren t necessarily has a doctorate in physics or something People that are really smart like what Troy said they won t really have that much of a problem finding jobs especially with a big corporation They don t have to necessarily work for the government or NASA or something So I think that the budget should stay where it is because that s pretty funny We ll go Megan and Tyler I don t know when it was mentioned but we were talking about how we re trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed and I feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now we re trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that s gone I feel like that s really important for the development of Earth is to know what it s going to be like when there is no more What can we do so that we don t turn into a Mars or Venus What can we do now to stop it from happening Good so you re making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there s an issue with our magnetosphere Potentially could we wind up like Mars So kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed future wise So almost like a selfish need to figure out what s going on out there and where we might go Anyone that hasn t spoken yet want to comment 
 So we go back remember this Do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest Okay What s happening is things are getting not broken up Another example of that would be measure 16 to 17 You would not want to breathe at the end of 16 Now I want to go back to 13 and I want you to do what we did yesterday where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties So what that does at 13 is it should da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daa da da da da da da da da da da da da dum Okay It s kind of funny to do that on the bass drum so just play the regular part on the bass drum okay I can try to Nah I d rather you not because it s going to muffle it s going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing Try it at 13 everybody Da da da da da da da Working on accents One two and ready and go Look at measure 15 Da da daa da da da da What s happening is some of you are changing 15 to this Tell me what s wrong with this Anybody recognize what s wrong with that Adrian You played four Yeah I played four sixteenth notes and then I played a note on beat four It s got a one and two three e and up Listen again here s the correct way Oops wrong finger Listen again Try that Measure 15 One and two and ready and go Again More accent That last note s really short and it s really strong One two 15 and play Now play it the way it s written but feel it the way you just played it That will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note One two ready and go and Okay see how it places it very crisply Let s go back to 13 Play it Break it down into the sixteenths Da da da da da da da Ready 13 we re going to go all the way through 20 One and two and ready and play and Now I m going to get to what we are beginning to learn today I m going to go ahead and put my tie up here Now is there anyone who can tell me what this is What is that Daniel A dotted eighth note This is a dotted eighth note Who can tell me what this note is Sedekia One sixteenth note It is a sixteenth note so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note Now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot With that in mind can somebody tell me what the value of that note is Cole It would last for like three beats Three beats And then you would have a sixteenth note Okay I think you re on the right track it would last for three of something but not three beats Landon Three fourths of a beat It would be three fourths of a beat so let s think about this remember an eighth note in 4 4 time gets half of a beat Everybody what s half of a half One fourth One fourth so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat Well that sounds a little bit complicated but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here So who can tell me what I would write for counts under this dotted eighth note Raise your hand Lydon Would it be one e One e because that s the same as having three of both and Jaylin what would go here a e Okay so this is just another way of writing this Let s do a measure of counting that Ready And go and One e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and Now I want all my first row to do that four times okay And go and One e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and Second row ready and go and One e and a two and one e and a two 
 That they need to make some sort of a change Like the turning point Like there s a turning point There s some kind of change that needs to occur Do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change No I think some no In Fahrenheit 451 how some people were assuming that Mildred already knew but she just didn t want to not like accept it but not be part of it She didn t want to be part of the change she just wanted to be in tune with society She never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point Even when she had the opportunity she didn t Right I think emotion plays a big role in that too because Faber let fear get in the way of him doing something so he basically created that little earpiece thing so that somebody else could do it for him and he could watch over somebody that s actually doing it Another person who s carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is Beatty because although he had all of the knowledge much more knowledge than Montag had about society and everything he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it then what s the point if he s not going to gain anything out of it Do you think also because he has all that knowledge he wants to use it to have power Since he knows all that he wants to manipulate keep them in control keep them in check and stuff No I don t think it s that he wants power I mean it s that he s seen the bad side of things and like all humans you don t like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it With education he knows it s good because it helps you think outside of the box and everything but it s bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything Then you realize that there s genocides there s slavery there s wars there s too much negativity The government also doesn t want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go The more information they know the more possible ways they can use it against them I like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff because I guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people Vulnerable Vulnerable It s like if the people were the government s subordinates so it s not the government s people who they re protecting it s pretty much who they re in control of I kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing like in Harrison and bridge around again You get to see the emotion or what George has to go through but yet he doesn t do anything about it Harrison does It says right here His thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm It s showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head or whatever but Harrison is the one doing the actions He s the one that wants to go against the government and George isn t So do you think their relationship and the correlation of George and Harrison is just like Montag and Faber s where Faber doesn t want to do anything because he didn t want to go to jail in the South George doesn t want to go to jail because he doesn t want to lighten his own way because he would get what was it seven years Yeah For each sled that he takes out And Harrison is actually doing stuff And Montag isn t doing stuff So do you think that you need that person the one behind the scenes doing the stuff and then a person that s actually doing it or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill I think that you need people who are I think that you need people who are but I think that it s easier to so I think that way is better So you don t get in trouble I think the people that have the people in the front lines are always useful They are easier to camoflauge They are the ones with the real plans These people in the front don t usually come up with them Yeah but you have the plans and then you don t do it but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don t know how to use it Well not every body s that brave That s why you need to I think people need the support system like Faber was Montag s support system He had a plan Don t let him tell you he sees walk away walk away I guess here s my question So in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow I want you to think our question is to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws right created by government I know I m asking you to respond with to what extent should citizens comply with these unfair laws But we re also talking about so who should act right So who should be the one to act out to lead to go against the government Because we re looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out We re looking at people who have knowledge who have strength who are talented But they re not leaders And we re also looking at people who may not have those qualities they have the potential to have those qualities but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push So when we say to what extent should citizens comply do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody Or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices Do you even think that s fair that it s a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole I want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we ve seen a group of people whether it is a whole group or just a couple of people who take charge who lead and impact change Are there any examples that you can connect to that Do you think that that s even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people I see it as a way every time there s a change or a law or something that affects a certain group of people it s never really based on the whole group of people Like all citizens It s more of a target and when a certain group is attacked or targeted it makes others not really I don t want to say care but it doesn t really matter to them because they re not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that Or yeah it s just basically it s that group of people who have to I guess express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right but I think it s necessary for a unit You probably need that one person who spreads the message and then I think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it s going to be your turn So here s my question because on your AP exam on your final exam for your argumentative essays you have to be able to generate your own examples So I know Omar you ve got a very clear idea but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific and that s what you can discuss Let s see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific You want to say hey let s look at this specific example where this actually happened Any thoughts on that Anything with slavery with Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists in the north They really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and I guess that s where civil disobedience comes from is the abolishment of slavery Well the need to abolish slavery That it really wasn t really blacks or Africans or whatever you called them back then Wanting to be set free was people that weren t even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free And I think that s more important and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery They re not benefiting they re not getting negative from it so it s like you really think that it s wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation It s saying that it s wrong I want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that s going on right now because I guess maybe not a lot of you are aware but there s I don t know if you guys heard something about the green eye That recently that s in the past And I think that s very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but I guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in That kind of stops them and discourages them from to keep going So I guess that idea is I don t know it s kind of opressive because they re trying to maintain you in that little it s just marginalizing you and yeah I think it needs more support So I want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests right People were really protesting that and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against right And when we look at the questions to what extent should we comply with unfair laws If that is an unfair piece of legislation to what extent do you then choose to protest How far would you be willing to take it Because we talked about this this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion Like look at Harrison right Dancing on stage as a ballerina Doesn t really seem all that tough right But for him he was taking a big stance right Not about borderline violence right I want you to look at what Thoreau did He didn t pay his taxes He wanted to go to jail He was happy there He was like don t bail me out Had nothing to do with violence right You hear a lot of people protesting you know Issues regarding the DREAM Act but to what extent should they comply with the laws Do you use violence Do you even take it there Do you use more creative forms of protesting I want you to consider how far do you take it How far do you show your protest What is acceptable and where do you draw the line Good reaction lots of reaction Let s hear from people we haven t heard from I want you to go back and think about your goals that you set I m hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions chose goals that might push you to speak up So let s hear from a few folks that we haven t heard from yet and share the air time Any volunteer Jesus what do you think Like Omar said like the DREAM Act has an ill affect on a lot of people It doesn t really affect me but I know a lot of friends that it is affecting It s not really fair that it really didn t pass but when we want to try to push something like Julian said for slavery it didn t really take it took such a long time for them to really get the rights There was the abolishment there was Frederick Douglass during that time But as time went then came Martin Luther King who was the center person who started the really big move for African Americans to realize their own rights He lead the protests marches if you gather groups of people over time if you speak up with your voice people will hear Even people like African Americans they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal There should be rights and everyone no matter what color you are So for Latinos like us for the it s such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights but the dream that was once dead but even though it didn t pass people should not be put down like Aw it didn t pass So they ll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights cause if we stay together anything can happen If we stay together as one something will happen I am hearing two things and we ll get back to Stephanie really quickly I think she s just itching to get in this conversation I m hearing two things One that it takes a collective group effort It s not just one person but it needs to be many people involved As many people involved And I m also hearing that it takes a lot of time So those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws That s kind of like right now that it s kind of more modern because You think so no no no I want you take this idea that Omar brought this idea of mental slavery of oppression of our intellect our intelligence Is that something that you think is just recent Is that something that s been happening over time I want you to think about that and see we might isolate one part of the problem but I want you to think on a broader scale Is it really just one isolated event or is this one in a stream of events Stephanie you had something that you were Yeah all of them were in the governement and I was thinking of the movie Milk How they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in California and to be heard which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way But he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard One part in the movie that I ll always remember is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he s gay and all of that But he just hangs up but yet he does it for him most likely because he wants people like that to be heard And that s kind of what my connection is I think another historical event besides the slavery and what you just said is the nine eleven I think it s the short term one It took actually really quick the terrorists going up there It just took one simple idea to tell them Oh let s just go 
 I can go into group two because that Except this one is like these two are like both like pop These two are kinda like both pop Because water s not bubbly This one s bubbly and this one s Coca Cola Or Dr Pepper Do you have a secret rule to use We re gonna get like one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles Because they re kinda the same Okay And this one like So I m gonna make sure I m understanding what your rule is gonna be Does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container It s the bubble Bubbles and stick to the side Yeah Okay so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side Is that right Yeah Okay great alright Alright friends In order to be closer together to really see how this is going to work I m going to ask Anagelia s group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here Go ahead and bring your liquids with you Thank you very much And What we re going to do is we re going to set up our rule so that it s up here at the front So actually Anagelia if you don t mind Callie and Natalie if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then Anagelia s going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here Okay Thank you So we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table For your what s my rule okay So you re thinking of your property and you re going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don t fit the property here Who would like to go first Who would like to start Okay so Ryan s group Ryan s group Come up and set up one that fits your rule Just a minute Ryan Isabella needs to come with you One that fits your rule here and one that doesn t fit your rule here Just one just one One in each Okay thank you You can be seated okay So we have this one fits their rule this one doesn t fit their rule I can tell Bryson s already thinking about what it could possibly be This one can fit their rule Hold on one second That s where we re going but wait one second okay Let s talk about what we see Any ideas so far of what might be going on here Bryson do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space The bubbles on the top Okay so you think it has something to do with bubbles Do you have one that fits bubbles That one He s got a hypothesis Now Lena he s got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be Do you think this fits the rule Yeah Okay So now we need to check in with Isabella and Ryan Does that fit the rule Yes It does okay It doesn t fit my rule So your rule should be the same as your partner s Do you remember what that rule was Ryan Yeah Okay great Alright so Anagelia thanks for raising your hand Do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn t fit the rule Thank you Callie Callie will you check in with Isabella and Ryan and see if that fits Isabella does that fit the rule Yes Okay Anybody else who s ready to bring one up Oh another rule Another one that might fit or doesn t fit Rigo would you like to try Which one do you think would go with this group Which ones from the ones you have would go with this group Bryson giving you a hint No that one doesn t That one here So you think both of these fit The blue one just the blue one Because look at this one It doesn t leave white bubbles Okay so if that one doesn t fit the rule where would it go Rigo Where would this one go This one Over here right Just hold that thought for a just a second No this one we said does fit it Right Isabella and Ryan are we on track so far Yes Okay Anagelia did your group have another one to bring up Okay That one you think fits in this side fits the rule And Callie you think this one doesn t fit the rule Look when it shakes Doesn t do anything Okay okay Natalina do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us What s going on here I think it s the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group when you shake it it has lots of bubbles That one doesn t Okay so let s go back a minute though because you said two different things Sit on your botton Rigo First you said bubbles and not bubbles And then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it Is that the same rule or is that different Is the shaking part important do you think to that rule Okay so can you state it one more time for us When you shake it if there s bubbles it will go that one If it doesn t go bubbles it goes in that one Okay And Isabella and Ryan is that correct Yup Excellent so the shaking was the really important part of that great At least for this one it s weird Right because right now this one has no bubbles But if I shake it it gets bubbles later Okay Excellent Can you remember which ones you had in your group Yes Can you come and get them I m not sure if I can I m glad you can remember Can you remember Rigo which one you put out there This No that one s ours No this is ours Um yeah One two three four five I think you ve got five These ones are originally from Isabella and Ryan I think Yeah Isabella and Ryan can you come back and get yours Great Alright which partnership is ready to tell to not tell but to do another secret rule I thought I brought a blue Did you think you brought a blue one You figured it out Okay Natalina s group Can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule Natalina you want to check that one more time make sure that s correct Okay this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier And let s leave this on the table Anagelia can you remind what the rule is Stick to the sides Anagelia can you remind Callie what the rule is too Go remind Callie So these two do fit right Alright show us one that doesn t please Okay Careful with the liquids please You okay Alright We actually got a little extra help here now didn t we We got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not Isabella do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn t fit the rule Ryan can you sit on your bottom again please Watch what Isabella is doing Oh cool See if you agree Ryan watch what Isabella s doing and see if you agree Okay I agree Natalina Callie and Anagelia thumbs up Is that correct Did she put it in the right place Yeah Okay good Bryson and Rigo do you guys have one that you want to put in Yeah more than one More than one okay Oh three Oh Go ahead if you think that s right I think that s right Rigo Rigo can you tell us why you put these two here Because it can bubble Bubbles in it Because they have bubbles in them Does this Does not Just a second just a second Callie Does this one have bubbles in it Yes it does So it s not bubbles and no bubbles You re on the right track though Take a look again Ryan do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here Stuff on the side And this one it goes away after awhile Maybe this is the rule Thank you Ryan So far so good Yeah Okay Yeah Let s bring up all the rest Oh Bryson you can go ahead and leave those there You can go ahead and leave those there I think we re okay actually If you have any other liquids to bring up This one Bring them on up And put them where they belong and we ll see if we can figure out what the rule is Bring it on up bring it on up Ryan bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes This one s confusing Ooh a confusing one I love a confusing one do you know why Because it helps you think It helps you think exactly It makes it more difficult to figure out Would you like to consult with someone Do you want to consult with Ryan Ryan come here a minute Your partner needs your help She s trying to figure out where this one goes What do you think I think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one Now remember we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule Because look this one has bubbles This one if I shake it has bubbles So bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule Okay Thanks for your help Ryan Anybody else give Isabella some assistance here Well you know the rules already right Anagelia What do you think Anagelia Which one do you think it goes in Listen to Anagelia Rigo What s your opinion what do you think Does it go in this group Or this one What do you think Even though you know what the rule is can you help her figure out how to classify it Rigo are you watching What do you think It goes in In that one That one In this group right here Okay What do you think Isabella You want Bryson s idea What does Bryson think I think it goes in that one Because Because most of them kind of move when you shake them But when you shake those they don t Oh interesting Let s try that out okay Okay Ryan come a little closer to me right now please We re trying out something different Bryson just said the ones Rigo you can stay where you are you re right close by No Bryson just said something really interesting He just said stand on your own two feet please Thank you He just said that these ones don t move when you shake them and these ones do move when you shake them and that s how they re classified So I want to just double check that I make sure that I agree with what you re saying Okay Bryson Does this one move when I shake it Not really I can t really Try it out Okay See what you think It kinda does Does this one move when you shake it Yes Yes okay Oh it sticks on the walls Ah ha So are you amending your rule Are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides Yes So this group right here is Ding ding ding ding ding ding This group right here is the one s that stick on the sides Yes Ding ding ding ding ding Ring the bell ring the bell But we still haven t figured out even if we know that that s what the secret rule is where does this one go That one That one that one Okay Natalina Let s take your opinion first Rigo we re listening to Natalina And then we ll hear from you okay Go ahead Natalina I don t think it follows our rule It does You think it s totally out here it s separate It s not in either category No I don t think it goes in this one You don t think it goes in this one No I do think it goes Because Because it doesn t really stick to the walls It doesn t really stick to the walls Okay you wanna hold it make sure Stick to the Other opinions Other opinions Anagelia I couldn t hear you Could you say it louder so the group can hear you Go ahead It should go there because when you move it some parts stick to the wall and some parts When you move it It sticks to the part It does stick to the walls Yeah Okay It s dirty Isabella what do you think I think it should go in this one because it kind of It sticks to the wall at first and then it goes down So and then doesn t stick to the wall Okay it sticks to the wall first and then it doesn t so you think it goes in this one May I have it just for a minute One thing I m noticing that s a little confusing for me if I look at this one compared to all the others this is the only one that s not colored in this group Does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they re colored somehow So this one s not as sticky because it s less colored maybe I don t know So you re saying it sticks at first but then not so much after that Can we tell how much this one sticks No Yeah Yeah It really sticks It really sticks How about this one can you tell how much this one sticks Yeah It kinda sticks That does stick Most of it Some of it That does So it sticks but it is Most of it goes away and some stays Some goes away and some stays 
 I m not too sure if I like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it I m not too sure about that It makes it less It s different in an awkward way I don t know how to explain it It doesn t have any depth to it It has no dimension Like she s standing there he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then It looks like she s laying down Actually yeah it does I mean he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop And I m just not feeling it I like the Mick Jagger one but I m not feeling this Taylor Swift one See I like pop art I just I don t know Did you notice that What I thought it was a green that goes in to this That s on them it s more like a quiet like she s sleeping softness But I didn t notice it that it goes into purple periwinkle and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side Did you see that Then it goes in to two and he breaks off the colors And it s like All right let s take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions And then we ll talk about a whole group discussion and see what we all have and what we want to write In a sense it would be a good picture for the stance that she s in You know the title of the album is called Fearless and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless In the way she s standing The way he did it it just doesn t look like her It s like the wind s coming back and it pushes her hair Yeah but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera But then her hair wouldn t have been like that Yeah but they just need some big ole fans it s Hollywood You can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back You would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless You have to think It s more of country music I mean I could see if you were saying like hip hop pop And you get like all forceful What s Up I m here But they re saying you know she s a pop icon If she s a country artist then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts Because she s mainstreaming into the different areas she s creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys You wouldn t compare her to Kenny Chesney Those who want newer generation of country Right All right let s just try and get to our last question and then we ll talk about whole group and get you back in here Let s go ahead and start you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer if you want your input put in So let s just talk about the describe section What we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words What kind of words would you use to describe this piece Let s start with Mick Jagger Bold Bold Proud Proud Electric Electric Okay those are good ones What about Taylor Swift It s more feminine More soft It s pale it s delicate and Delicate Soft You said soft It s like he s almost scared when he s doing Taylor Swift compared to Mick Jagger Because Mick Jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere I think he almost makes Taylor look almost intimidated She s kind of pushing away The position and you have all these colors around her With the selection and Innocence Yeah I think we talked about that with Taylor a little bit You kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well Plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it like paints a picture She has an innocent expression I d say innocent yeah Okay Fierce You say fierce Okay It s like her personality she just breaks it out with this bold pose All right good So those are some good words key words to describe it So analyzing Let s figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss Colors Colors Color s a big one In both of them actually Paint strips The paint strips it looks like it s a lot of paint It kind of creates a lot of movement with the way that it s flowing through the pieces All right so our big ones are color He said in the video color is everything And that s his main focus is color The different colors make the value in the picture the dark colors make the darker shades and light colors He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger than he did in Taylor And like the contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more loud I d definitely say it s louder Okay good Let s discuss the movement a little bit So if you look at it I see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair I like how the hair is like that and I like her position from the side because I think it adds interest Like I was saying a second ago if she was looking straight forward I don t think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side And that s just my personal opinion but I like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it s creating the movement through the piece And then with the Mick Jagger one the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me How he chose the green and the red to contrast each other I think that s big bold move in this area Good Now what are our focal points Faces Faces And what are the big things that factor in for that Why is that What did he do The colors around her make her pop The colors surrounding If you look the face is white right here and then her skin tone is pale as well So that kind of pops out against the bold colors What do you guys think about the materials The silk screen and the acrylic paint You guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars and just dipped in a couple different ones And just started coloring So what do you guys think about his process and the materials he uses He doesn t really choose what direction he just kind of goes with the flow It s very free if you watch him Mindless Mindless creativity He does what comes to him which is interesting Any other comments about the actual process or materials I think It would have been more amazing if he didn t use the silk screens So you d rather him just paint it than add the silk screen I think it would be more like a wow factor And some of his pieces are just paintings More of the people though like the Rollins he painted And the ones he did for President Obama President Reagan some of the Statue of Liberty And also some of the other people like Aerosmith and the Beatles as well And he s usually famous for painting his faces And he would go into the color 
 What part of soccer you really want to know What about the measuring or even the measure That s what you ve got to figure out Or how long you can Okay I mean how many like times you can do it Okay so you could sit there and count how many bounces kicks or you could sit here with the timing How much you can do it and how much time you need Okay how many per minute So you ve got lots of ideas You re going to have to choose that Do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other Yeah Okay so I think you have both come up with all four of you You guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one And you ll collect your data and you ll collect your data and then present it as a company How about that soccer team or company Alright Alright you ve got a good name Alright that s part of it It works Catch your attention I know Stephanie We re having trouble Because we barely decided on it We didn t do the friction one but the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle The little car that you pull back and see how far it goes Okay And the parachute one so I thought of the parachute one What do you think Yeah You re a team on it okay So what are you going to measure with a parachute Pardon Yeah you re going to use metric which is centimeters Stephanie s got control of the metrics So can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes Well we don t know how far Because we know we can t throw it out the window Oh no It s too far Okay but you know what Maybe on the counter You guys are coordinated I would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights How high you could You could do some test runs right Yeah Don t you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision Okay Yeah And you know what If you d like if we have time I want you to do test runs in here but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear That s what I was thinking Okay but I do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final But make your hypothesis what you re thinking because I think you re on a roll here It s going to be good I don t like his interview So how far In this experiment can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something Okay I think you re making another experiment right So what s your first experiment Just how fast it would drop by itself How fast from one distance Yeah Okay so one distance you re going to see how fast it ll drop And then you re going to compare that to from that distance Adding weights to it Okay alright Well I wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights Okay so she s got one experiment and you ve got another one Do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together You do yours and you do yours Because you only can change one variable at a time right Yeah So what s your variable you re going to measure I m going to measure the distance how far How high different distances And what are you going to do And you re going to time it right Yeah Okay and you re going to do what s your variable that you re going to change The weight Okay But you re going to see how fast it drops Yeah Alright so I think you re going to need another paper Okay Because you ve got two experiments going Are you going to support each other in each one Yeah That s pretty cool double points How are you guys doing Oh I like it Okay tell me about this one Okay so we re going to get two or three different size basketballs like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then Yeah And then we re going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there So like how high it bounces depending on its size Oh so the size of the balls to see how High it bounces Okay If it bounces higher What do you think I think the small one will bounce higher Because there s less material to like have to drop from there Like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn t go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher So based on your observations You re a good observer So your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would Whoa are these your averages Yeah they re my averages Wow okay Good So how are you guys going to present it as a team She s probably going to do like what we thought would happen And I m probably going to do the results of what actually happens Are you comfortable with that Uh huh Okay to make it really clear what you did Yeah yeah Okay I think that ll be really good because this is great this is great to show and then you re writing your conclusion with numbers in it I like that And then you told yours was rejected right Yeah Okay now does that mean you re a failure No Do you guys mind going first Sure Because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment I think that might give them some confidence and it ll take the pressure off them because they don t really want to go first Okay so let s go Aqui tenemos que cambiar la friccion sobre dos Tenemos que cambiar Oh wow the graph looks good And your data chart looks good So Jenni will you shows yours On the first dictation thing when we have to go up there do we have to go up by step like show everything What do you think Or just show our graph What do you think would be the best I say showing the graph Should we show like our question and then should we show the whole thing What do you think I don t know I think so Showing both Okay But it s probably the most important thing to convince them I d definitely show your data Okay we ll show his because it s better than mine Okay very good And let s see yes it looks professional So these numbers How many times did you do this experiment Three times wait four three twelve 100 I don t know Because there s five and there s three Okay We ve got one two three four five trials here Is that correct No we went up three but he wrote trials for these Oh okay So we can fix that Que dibujaste No tienes que poner esto Tienes que poner esto It s very neat So you added one two three and divided by By three Okay alright that s how you got the average Yeah Okay and who figured out the answer Me Jenni Wow Jenni We did was it highest to lowest Yeah Highest minus lowest divided by two Awesome You definitely should show this And then this would be uncertainty Yeah And these are the mounted distance with different kinds of What are these five things The shoes Okay The shoes It gets tiring when you have to do it three times Right Now my question is if you didn t have the shoes how did you get the data for it I did it at my house You did them at your house Okay And then what s this one right over here The socks Okay and that s one you definitely did at school Yeah we did it here and we also did the Vans here And the Vans Alright so that s good Would you explain that to the class Yeah That these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error Yeah because of the surface Like at his house it would have been not like floor it would be carpet or something like that Yeah what s your floor like where you did it Well I had to do it like outside during the rain Oh my goodness Okay so you ve got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any Yeah Okay maybe it would And so what would a scientist do in the next time Would have done it in a dry place Yeah do it in a dry place Yeah I like that Okay so you ll tell that for the next time Yeah But I really liked how you guys didn t give up How you actually did the socks compared to your Vans And you know how you pull those out what are research we could have done your boot Oh yeah my boot Yeah I could have Want to do my boot No I m good No My legs are tired Okay I m sure they are Well did you accept or reject your hypothesis Accept We accepted it And tell us why Because You ve got the evidence right there don t you The experiment like that one question we had it goes with the real world or something like that Could you repeat this experiment The whole thing Yeah or could anybody do this experiment Yeah it s easy It is Did you write your procedure so it s easy It s hard to write a procedure because it Okay and if you had to do this experiment over again would you do it any differently or not No Would you test for anything else Good point How much pressure right Okay alright any other questions Nice job Thanks Jenni s team Sorry to rush you guys but we got the idea What was your experiment Our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk uses four different pairs of shoes like Adidas Converse or Vans The Adidas would go the farthest The Vans No just show the data You were correct And you were correct because the Adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116 6 centimeters We accepted our hypothesis Jenni continue this Why me Because you re professional Well we were going to do an interview but we forgot to So what do we do It s really bad Why do you think it s bad Jenni I don t know Esta bien esta bien Well here s the amount of distance and here s the kind of and I marked them as the average they all went So we can see that the Adidas went more than the Vans did because the Vans were like the lowest Will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting Because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again Oh yeah Well it s because Jose did half of the experiment he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and I think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry So I think that affected the experiment There s probably different traction on shoes Si Simon What kind of shoe would you try next time A boot Oh like my major walking boot Si Alright What would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot If you look at the Well because it s soft so I think it ll go farther Possibly go farther Okay alright That would be interesting to try out Does everybody see how this can apply to real life Tienen preguntas Hablan en ingles no espanol Can you explain how this would apply to real life if you aren t just moon walking Jose Jenni Don t look at me I don t know Go on the actual moon Gym class Yeah gym class Does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class Sometimes Okay some people do I don t You don t Yeah like these shoes they slide a lot like in the gym Okay so it might be different shoes for different jobs Yeah Okay well thank you Nice job Good we have time for our last presentation Thank you Alright sorry to rush everybody I know you could talk more about it Thanks for being a good audience Hello class how are we doing today Good So our title was dirty water versus clean water Thank you Our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water 
 Please freeze for a moment Gentlemen what did you think about your performance I wouldn t say terrible but were you accurately on pitch all of you No No Like as soon as the ladies came in you were like Whoo and then you forgot what you were singing Okay So don t let them distract you They re trying They re trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off But hold firm men Hold firm to your position All right Let s try it again Here we go Sing noel sing noel noel noel Lock it in Sing noel sing noel noel noel Two parts Sing noel sing noel noel noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Together Sing we all noel The support Sing we all noel Two parts Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Back to the beginning Sing noel sing noel noel noel End song All right If you were going to give yourself a grade what would you give it Alison As a class Like out of A s and B s and C s Yep I would give an A minus Okay and why the minus What do you think we think need to improve The pitch was kind of off at some parts Okay So there was maybe some pitch issues What about energy level It was okay but this But one of the things about African music is it is something that is like felt in their soul Okay It is traditionally when you listen I mean they are just letting it You know when we see any of the performances or listen to any of the CDs we ve listened to it s just very gut felt I feel like you re Sing noel sing noel noel noel So This is so pretty Yes we want SING NOEL SING NOEL NOEL NOEL Especially on that Sing we all noel That s me We re singing It s like you re telling people We are singing Not Sing I think we all noel Okay So let s make sure that we re right there on that One more time See if you can get a little more weight to your sound I don t mean make it flat I just mean with more confidence more security more support Okay Here we go Sing noel sing noel noel noel Awesome Sing noel sing noel noel noel Two part Sing noel sing noel noel noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Support this Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Good And stop there So you get the idea That was awesome Did you hear the difference Yeah Awesome I love that you challenged yourselves You pushed yourselves there It s hot Those notes are kind of high I know that And you just pushed right through it So good job Let s review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time So I m going to come here so we can do our body percussion Real quick We are going to start with our bass part Ladies and gentlemen we are not going to use these right now because traditional African music is by rote meaning you learn it by hearing You learn it by doing If you are a visual learner these are our music stands by the instruments so this will help you And you know I want everyone to be successful so you use the tools that will help you be successful You be an independent learner where you decide If this is what you need grab a music stand Okay If you don t you don t need it Okay So there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick Okay So basses first Let s all kind of scoot over this way So bass section first We have starting with your left hand Sing oh sing oh sing noel Sing oh sing oh sing noel And you have that crossover Sing oh sing oh sing noel Everybody feel comfortable with that Any questions You look good You look like you have it All right Then we have the xylophones This one s a tricky one So we have for that part Let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time So we have Sing noel sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Okay So the trickiest part is how many G s All right So remember we have low C and high C So you have C C C C C C And there s four Gs over that syncopated rhythm G G G G F E D Okay So it s kind of like One two three down the ladder you go Okay So let s try that C C C C C C G G G G F E D C C C C C C G G G G F E D Got it Got the idea All right Then we go on to the glockenspiels And for that one we can just clap that rhythm because I think on the instruments it will be easier to see to show because they re so obviously a little so it s not really like that So here we go It goes Sing oh yes sing noel noel Sing oh yes sing noel noel Sing oh yes sing noel noel Okay Got the idea for that rhythm So I will come over and help that section and some of you may remember that from last time Then we have our percussion section Okay We have first the conga drum A real quick review on conga drum playing Everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you If we can kind of spin back here so I can show you When you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit And scoot over that way There we go So when you play conga drum you actually are going to hold it in between your legs and put your feet around the base and you re going to tip it out from you So that that way the sound can come out but you also have the correct play style Remember pat on the ends when you re playing And those are in You can pat this on your lap as well Right now practice on your fingers Okay So here s on this Practice with a good technique right now Ready Go This is the part of the conga drum All right You ve got the idea And that goes over and over each measure Then we have the log drum And the log drum And again the parts are right here on the stand if you need them You re going to have One side you re going to play Sing So basically And it doesn t matter with those Sing noel sing noel sing noel Okay So you can clap that real quick Sing noel sing noel sing noel sing Okay See how it fits Hello Welcome Thank you very much All right So Next we are going to have this part which is traditional African bell And this one you have Rest rest rest noel Sorry hi to low So it s Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel rest Can you snap it Noel Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel And you can try it Rest rest rest Hi and fast Noel Rest Get them up Noel Rest rest rest noel Yes Ladies and gentleman I m always spot checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we re doing this It s really important that I see that participation Because then when we go to pick parts I m looking to see who has it Yes there s choice but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing Okay So let s try it again Ready Go Rest rest rest Rest rest rest Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel You got it And then I love these shakers You are the pulse You are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song So it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together So again really important We might add in some other more African instruments They re kind of loud so we ll see if you can get the correct sound So what I d like you to do now Do you have any question All right If you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time I would challenge you to maybe pick a different one Okay If you were still working on it you re welcome to stay there But without any payoffs so just kind of selection I would like you all to go and pick an instrument part Remember we have glockenspiels basses xylophones and percussion So open Two glockenspiels open and a bunch of xylophones open Who was there first Who was there first between you and Ellen I was here You were there Okay So if you want to join the glockenspiels you can do that You can go to xylophones Oh nobody s up to the challenge All right Once you get there you can start practicing All right Hold up everybody All right Thank you Since we re trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually if you have the green mallets would you especially for you guys switch them out with the felt mallets instead So here s a set Well you need those for that as well So we have one There should be another one in there Oh here right here Nope those are green You don t want those Oh here s another one right here Here here you go here s a set That s awesome Thank you Because that s just going to make it a lot softer and not quite as angry sounding All right So let s listen to each part so you can know what you re listening for Remember when you are playing in an ensemble like this if you can t hear the other parts what does that tell you You re playing too loud Yes you re playing too loud And remember again texture is everything We want to be able to pull out the different parts so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that But for right now let s make sure that we can keep it soft Okay It s not a competition All right No one s going to win It s the whole class that we re trying to do this together So if we hear bass part first And let s go ahead and add at least shaker for right now and then we ll build in one or two sections One two ready go Okay Time out So you re listening for the beat She s watching me instead of the basses right Because you re doing their work a little bit and you need to keep it nice and steady What happened we ended up with three different tempos Did you hear that One two ready go Okay Pretty good And then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are Okay One thing that will help is adding the singing to it Okay 
 Dakota didn t want to bring his because it s all broken Well we can still look at it Go get it honey Actually Hannah bring Dakota s petroglyph over please Yeah that s the thing with clay It breaks very easily Okay All right Will you still be able to tell us about it He said that it exploded Please don t break it any more Are you going to be able to talk about it still You can tell us what was on it Okay put it down Addy or it s going to break Okay So you guys you did Your small group was Washoe and you re going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after The whole group The whole classroom Okay Okay So what I need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found And the four things that I want you to make sure somebody knows something about food shelter clothing and location But if you found something else you want to talk about go ahead So anybody chime in Okay I think I know where they re located Can you tell us South Lake Tahoe I know what they ate In your strong voice though They ate onions They ate wild potatoes wild carrots I think a little bit Wild mustard sunflower seeds wild carrots wild potatoes wild strawberries raspberries wild gooseberries wild rosehips wild rhubarb pine nuts and they used Sweet potatoes wild turnips wild spinach seeds Okay Do you think we re good on food Yeah Okay I think Olivia got the part Well we ll talk about that after So we have location Shelter Go ahead Okay Who s going to go next I have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes Okay What do you have your information on I have clothing They used rabbit skins buckskins and plants Okay And I m sorry Coleman What did you say They used sticks and leaves to build their homes Okay So you got those four covered Any fun facts you guys found Dakota what did you find out Give us one fun fact In 1859 the Washoe Wait Let Dakota guys Remember we re trying to be good listeners In 18 Go ahead sweetie In 1859 the Washoe had about 90 people times Aw No no not 90 900 Can I see what you wrote They had 90 000 or Nine hundred Nine hundred and now they only have 300 No let s see The population Well I got it off the computer Yeah I got 1500 In 1855 the Washoe numbered about 900 But are now reduced to about a third of that number What that the same fact you had Dakota Yeah Yeah very good Thank you Dakota I got in 2007 there was 1500 But I got it off the computer too and it said that Well you know the computer is not always I got the latest What kind of data did you get Like demographic Or where did you get yours from I got it from Google Well guys 300 was what yours said Dakota And yours said 1500 Yeah Are you sure yours wasn t 1500 from before And now it s 300 Well it said in 2007 Okay On here on my brain copy Okay We might need to look at that some more you guys We ll look into that before we report on that But that would be a fun fact anyway Joe did you tell us anything Yeah I have another fun fact Okay A fun fact Their houses are called Gadus Gadus okay Okay Now who hasn t had a turn guys All of you got your hands up Let s include our little friend Addy Okay They made baskets Any good baskets Mostly Dot So La Lee Most famous one She was famous for making baskets What was she famous for Olivia She was the She made the most baskets than other Washoe people the other Indians And why was she more famous than all the other Indians I don t know that but I think she was like a really good basket maker You think she was a good Can you scoot over I can yeah Okay Did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets Yes Did you know that they re in very Oh you have a picture Awesome These are actually Dot So La Lee s baskets Mm hmm Okay So the thing if you every get to see one of Dot So La Lee s baskets they re woven so tight you could carry water in them And we talked about symmetry today in math They re perfectly symmetrical Yes they re woven so tight that you can put water in them And even Dot So La Lee had like 2000 You what She had made that many baskets She made how many A lot Two thousand Two hundred and something Wow It would be nice to have one of those now huh Yeah But they re like You can t even buy them You cannot buy them huh They re like in a museum They re in museums but I think some people do have a private collection of them Really Maybe one or two yeah They re not like our petroglyphs that we re going to talk about Can you have a petroglyph in your private collection No Those you can t have Okay So you guys let s see who wants to be the writer Do you have a pencil Grab that pencil Would you write your tribal name up here You guys are Washoe And then go around Addy and find out Write the name of the person next to the food the shelter and that s what you re going to kind of be responsible for Let s get Addy And you can go around and ask each person or you can say Who wants to do food W A S H O E I ll do fun facts I ll do shelter I ll do fun facts No I ll do shelter Okay How are we going to decide Joe should do the clothing Joe should do clothing Is that okay with you Do you think I should tell you the name of the Hold on We re not doing these We ll do that later Thank you Olivia Olivia volunteered for food Joe do you really want to do clothing I was either going to do clothing or language because I found a whole thing for Everybody can do a fun fact too But I was going to do a fun facts We need somebody to do food and location Okay I ll do location Shelter Shelter and location I got I ll get shelter Good Thank you Coleman And then I know you guys want to do fun facts too so everybody can do a fun fact L E and then M A N C O L E M A N L E L E M A N Okay Now we just have location left But what s Dakota doing What do you want to do How about me and Dakota will do location together Does that work Okay That s who s going to do the fun fact Everyone can do a fun fact So write Thomas Dakota for location No don t worry about fun facts Everybody has got a fun fact right there So if both of you are doing it it s got to be super duper Okay so we re going to look up if they lived in Washoe They probably did Did you have their names down Addy It s like Washoe people Where are you guys going to find the information Dakota And Dakota D A K O T A Better You guys what did we find out about Google Maybe you want to find two If you have two things and they don t say the same thing you might want to check another one There s a lot of maps on Google There s a lot of maps on Google Yeah We re going to go We re going to go on maps and look where Okay Thanks I m going to take that so when you Okay So next week or the week after you guys are going to do a whole group class presentation on your tribe And you re welcome to bring pictures or artifacts or like pieces of whatever if you want to do that You can bring a basket Obviously it s not going to be a Dot So La Lee Can I bring a arrowhead Did your tribe have arrowheads Yeah Okay Now looking in front of you you guys for our art project we did something What is this called Who knows Olivia I like how you raised your hand The petrograph Louder Petro The petrograph Petroglyphs And what is a petroglyph You re going to break yours Thomas Addy what s a petroglyph It s a carving in a rock A carving in a rock Did your tribe make petroglyphs We don t know Why don t you know Cuz they put things like right down They made it They just moved They just carved it in and nobody really knows unless there s someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down generation to generation Yes Very good What were you going to say You know when we were looking on that website We were looking on that website and one said Washoe Okay Yes So some of them they attri They say that they did it but we don t know who did what petroglyphs But in our state can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably And maybe if they found petroglyphs where your location was you could say those were Shoshone petroglyphs Would that work We re Washoe Washoe I m sorry All right So who wants to share theirs first So what you re going to do is you re going to share it and show the whole group and tell us what yours meant to you Okay Okay Addy you want to call on somebody Since everybody is dying to talk Who s going first Coleman Coleman can we see yours Okay I want to zoom in on it Hold it up a little bit because I got it up Okay What does yours mean to you It means that it s night and there s some stars and there s a duck And then there s a canoe on the water And there is a lot of meat and camping Camping Okay Anybody else want to go Pass it around Joseph Oh don t pass it around We don t want to break it We re going to stick them on wood or something Oh let me get a picture Oh I m zooming in Up higher Joe because I ve got this on a tripod Okay All right Mine is we re going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top And there s a snake trying to eat the duck There s an eagle It s daytime and the skies are clear Oh Addy you re calling on people Thank you Okay Addy sit back a little bit so we can see Miss Olivia random things but I think I know what it is It means they re hunting buffalo at night And then the daytime came and it s all rainbow And we caught some fish That s it Okay Good Who wants to go now Thomas Nice So there s a camp and there s a little hill behind the camp And there s people in war and there s a snake And then one person is not in war He s just trying to shoot a duck But then the other guy shot him and then there s And this has been happening for three days Okay Dakota Mine kind of blew up here Mine kind of blew What happened to yours honey It like kind of didn t turn out so well It like blew up in pieces Can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces Well it was like I don t know Did you have like hunting symbols or anything No He just did like squares I drew lines because I I remember I didn t really know what to write You didn t know what to write Okay That s all right But if you could do it again what would you do What would it mean to you I d probably make up a war thing A war thing Okay It s more war except hunt Hunting Oh okay Did you go Miss Addy Okay Humans were hunting for humans That s what s on mine Okay Addy I would wait until everybody was listening Thank you I can t show your Okay Just show the other children It s a sunny day A snake is trying to eat the fish The fish are in the river Cool What s the little zigzag Mountains Oh those are mountains Oh cool Sun Snake River Just fishing Just fishing So what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe What would have been your tribe only Baskets We could have maybe tried to weave something What else Basket but That wouldn t be too fun In our project like we could pretend that we were real 
 You re going to test and be coming up here for materials Okay go You just follow the lines If no if the lines if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper the termites will follow the lines We should draw like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow And we ll make it like this Well it s not going to be on a circle It can be like this and see if they ll follow that circle Yeah Would that be a good may I bother you with this I m just covering them up What are you saying Yeah well beside this one If termites we ll place on a red piece on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines then the termites will follow the lines in the circle Okay so you re going to use the color red line again What color paper would you use White White paper Yeah And I think since we ve already used colored paper I think that s a result of that Well again you could do yours and yours and tie them together Use different colored papers so what s the point of your test That depending on the colored paper we ll determine what the termites sight can do I would think it s the color of the line because that s what they re following So you think they re following the color of the line Yes Yeah but when they went to the end of the white paper they went to the black and they came right back Well no that s because they knew what it was that s because I like kept hitting them back Okay so you re kind of going along with the idea of color How could you prove that color was That color effects their You draw a bunch of different circles draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size but of different colors and see which one they go to I like that Nice okay On a white piece of paper Yeah Again I ve got colored paper The more tests you do the more accurate your results would be All right so let s do the same test but on two different types of paper So if termites are placed on a white piece of paper Put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out No that down Good and there you go So what were we thinking about testing Um putting tables in line using different color And to see if we re not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around Oh very nice Yeah because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down They followed it down Tricky okay They went it s true So they didn t follow this part Yeah because it curves No because they We drew the circle They go like then they curve and go down And they came here and went back up They all followed Hmm interesting Thank you four You ve got about two more about a minute and a half actually What are we thinking I m going to go ahead and cover these up We were planning on doing um like we think they re attracted to the ink and I m going to test it with like a marker a pen and a crayon Okay To see if like if they follow the ink better than the other ones Nice would you use the same color of ink Yeah because it would be the control There you go very nice Um what color paper are you going to use Should we use regular White I would say white yeah All right good Okay sounds good Where are your termites Stop playing with them and we re going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out What were you guys thinking about testing Mainly if they are going to follow the red line then they must be attracted to red They must be attracted to what Red Red Okay so how could you test that they are just attracted to red We re going to make two large circles Two large circles And some other lines And some other lines But what are you testing again If they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red Okay so you re talking about the color red Um would you use so you tell me what you re going to set up I m trying to follow Probably just a black one and a red one Lines or circles Circles Circles Okay all right Yeah basically just for fun Okay okay just for fun all right Um you should be collecting materials If pens and things aren t working let me know Dude get the line What happened to your situations Well we put tape over this and now it doesn t follow it over here I think they like the color red None of them are following any of these lines How could you continue to test that they like the color red Put more red over here I mean we also put the tape there and it doesn t like the tape It gets confused And we have the red paper and it didn t follow the black lines Or the pencil Yeah that s what I mean None of them here are even doing anything They get tired and just start standing there twitching Do you need some new ones No there are still pretty lively Yeah So what are some of the conclusions that you re thinking Oh Terrance be sweet Ah be sweet Ah white on red They only like that Also they only follow that type of pen They don t follow any other type of pen or pencil Um they don t necessarily have an affiliation to red Okay how do you know that Cause they walked off the red paper Okay they walked off the red paper So you threw that one out How could you continue to say that they like that particular pen and not having to do red We tried black pen We haven t tried another color on white yet See look it stopped at the tape It s confused at the tape No Neal what I asked you is that a pen or a marker It s a pen It s a pen Oh he s following the other We drew it on the other side We drew a circle on the other side It looked like he was following it Is it something inside of them No Like what the ink s made out of How could you test that Using the red pen on this Okay Taking two different pens Go grab some more That s a good idea Red color pen red color pencil You killed the ant Gentlemen be nice to your termites Oh oh wait wait Here Neal let s get All right group here s a red pen colored pencil Oh look That one s alive Okay now then so what are you saying is going on They re still following the red one Yeah they re still following the red pen So it s not necessarily an affiliation to the color red So it is something inside the ink So how can you test if it s something inside the ink I just got the other colored pencil Take another red pen Go grab some It s right there That s a pencil It s the color red look Stick with the no you just threw out the idea that it s red Stick with the color stick with the pen idea We need a pen like this No I think we have the exact same pen No no the blue one like this They have a blue one like that Go see there s blue pens up there Hey can we borrow a red pen I meant blue you know what I meant Bam it s a different type of pen It s all right Different type of pen but it s blue now Did you get a blue one No I just got red ones I got bundles Nice Now they re going to follow it Now I thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen I think it s that pen I ve got the same pen They re still the red I think they are Okay try that one There s a hole there by the way If you press through it it will break Go Are you going to make it intercept the line Yeah I m going to Oh look he s following the little one Maybe it likes circles Wait wait I still think it s something inside the ink Draw a square See if it follows a square So that would be able you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square So draw a square see what happens Yeah draw a square I ve got another black pen I have all these pens Why not draw the square inside of there Inscribe the square in the circle Terms terminology You re a professor now Oh it s following it It is the pen Curves are easier It didn t know where the line was Okay five four Um we drew different lines in the different types of pens markers colored pencils Did you do it all on the same page or on different pages On different colored pages Why would you do it on different colored pages Ah to make sure the tests varied Okay did you use the same color of ink on each page Describe to me your experiment web The whole group can chime in too Um like we drew like a black circle on a black sheet of paper Okay To see if they could only like Please don t be rude Black circle on a black sheet of paper Keep going what else And that didn t work They could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that Christian came up with that take a white piece of paper and we drew like every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles None of the other colors What were the blue and the red circles drawn with I believe different types of stuff Mainly pen though And this was all on one sheet of paper Well we tried it on different sheets too Okay That s what started us off Okay Um did you have it all on one sheet at first Yeah Okay what did you realize was wrong with that They were pretty much getting confused As in we re going to have issues with what Maintaining A control A control good Only one independent variable nice Um Nick s group how did you go through the indentation We drew several circles using each of the utensils and then I think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of if they weren t in the middle sort of eating off of the wood or like just exploring around they were following the pen Okay um your indentation line did you draw that with just pens different types of pens did you draw it with markers did you draw it with a paper clip We just used the same color but we used different things Like we used pens Vis A Vis colored pencils stuff like that Okay and what was your conclusion with that They followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation Because they came the termites into that line because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop and I figured oh well they must be blind because they can t see that there s a drop there Interesting point Why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation instead of a pen Because it wouldn t have shown a color but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen Okay so any components within that pen color chemicals type of pen whatever if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation you would have been able to do what Pen verses paper clip Pen would have looked I think it would have looked The paper clip would have looked deeper but the thing is like would it prove if you had it or not Had what or not If they followed the dent or not Not just like the color or the like smell or whatever Very good very good So by using the paper clip to create the indentation they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent maybe the scent from the pen the chemical from the pen that left the indent By doing the paper clip just by itself we would have been able to say okay that obviously doesn t leave any chemicals it doesn t leave any color and if they re following that indentation we know that that s what they are drawn too Okay Carly your group had an interesting set up Um we well we kind of did two All right But the first one we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with like white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper And that didn t really work so we did the other one and um with like the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper and they only went on the red pen one Okay what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described As in something that might have thrown off the results Paper I don t know Well notice in one of the experiments you used a what to create the circle The pen Okay you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what Paper But you used a Oh white yeah you used a white colored pencil So by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil what are those two things now Added on what Variables Added on variables Okay for one you re using pen and pencil another you re using colors So how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables Gentlemen calm down We could have used colored pencils the whole time Okay could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time Good Um what group haven t I talked to Matthew explain to us the set up of your group Do you want to start I don t know what to say Oh okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it so we decided maybe it s not color So we took a black pen a big one Um we took a black pen and then two red pens of different type and two blue pens of different type and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue It was the BIC pens so we decided there must be something in that in the chemical structure of that ink that s you know similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort Um and the termites followed it Okay um did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday Yeah After school That was extracurricular All right so But we figured out the BIC pens We figured that out Okay good Excellent set up there Were there any variables that when I was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens You got this Yeah we were drawing with different shapes cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing So we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it And they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape it might be in the pen or the color They don t really like sharp angles though We drew a square and they got lost Yeah They couldn t find the angle Okay interesting So um if any of you did do any sort of research you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit and we learned that those were what Pheromones Enzymes Enzymes not enzymes What are pheromones having to do with We just spent three days on it Animal behavior Animal behavior communication their chemical signals Okay so we learned that termites emit these pheromones We might have encountered this last time and that s the same thing why ants follow a specific trail Um when honeybees sense danger they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out that danger s coming But the pheromone that termite s emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen in Bic and PaperMate pens actually mimics the chemical in the pheromones which is why they followed certain pens 
 Just take it in but take your tube off first Before you pull it out before you pull the needle out take your vacutainer tube off and this is Pull it out again Yeah Use your two by two remember Oh yeah There you go Good job Faye And guys it just takes a while This is not something you re going to learn overnight This is a skill that it takes a little while to learn You ve got to get hand movements down you ve got to figure out what works best for you You know if you need things placed in a different position But after this you all can start sticking the arms when you re not doing your book work Then whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down you feel like you re proficient then I ll watch you which I ll watch you doing then you all will stick me So what do you think Cassie Hmm What do you think Is it easier than you thought or harder than you thought Easier Yay Faye Those arms are a little harder to get Those veins are not as easy to feel as That s okay She s doing a fine job Two by two Sorry You to draw blood from them Pop your tourniquet Engage your safety Good job From down there Yeah They say not to use these and you can use hand veins but remember first choice second choice last choice and then hand veins If you re going to do hand veins you all have been through a lot of the book work already if you re going to use hand veins what kind of needle are you going to use Butterfly Butterfly Okay I know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic You guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab We ll do it at Dr Maderis clinic so that you all can get more sticks there Is there some people who draw only from around here Not usually Now there are some people they ll come in and they ll say You can t get blood from anywhere from me except here What that one lady told you is right here right I m better at popping it out Remember I couldn t get it in Good It will be something that after you get these hand movements down it ll just happen Because when I m not talking while I m doing it I mean it just flows Because I have done it for several years but for some reason after you get older it s hard to talk and do something at the same time That s what we re going to do today is you all are going to learn how to draw blood You re going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they re called And each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you re ready to start drawing blood And I know that Wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because guys when you get out there in the clinical area a lot of people don t follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws Guys that are medical assisting you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor s office When you re there in the doctor s office it s just you and the person So you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don t get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn The first things I want to talk about is your vein choice And I printed off your veins And the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle You can see this one better Yeah you see that one better Your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from That s the one that runs little finger side And then your cephalic is on the thumb side So this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from And the reason that this is your last choice vein is there s quite a few nerves that are right underneath it So if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage And I will leave this on the table as y all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice Nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you re choosing your vein You can only advance or withdraw the needle only You cannot go sideways I know those of you who s already been in the clinical site you ve seen them go sideways you ve seen them come out and go back in And guys that could be a liability for you and you re the only one that can protect your patient and you I ve got the materials set up Whenever we repeat this you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we ve got here because you ll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms When you go to clean your arm you re going to clean in a circular motion So I m going to go ahead and get started First thing you re going to do I don t need your gloves just the two hands First thing you re going to do is put on your gloves I just washed my hands but I m going to put on my gloves And why do I want to do that Jim So I don t get infected Yeah I don t want to come into contact with someone s blood Now who could protect me from coming into contact with someone s blood Yourself I m the only one that can do that And I can tell you from having my blood drawn people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn t know me from Adam And one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them So I am the only one that can protect me If I see you practicing without your gloves on it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day If I see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on then we re going to have a big talk okay Because you ve got to protect you I have a question With some people that you draw blood on do you have to wear a mask Like an eyeshield type thing If they are on precautions then yes you would And you ve seen at the hospital on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation If you were to go into one of those rooms yes you would In the ER when you draw blood you usually have on that splash mask Now usually with a venipuncture you re not going to have that much pressure It s not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would but still it s better to err on the side of safety But also if there s nothing wrong with me except I need a CBC to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield I m going to think Oh my gosh Why is she doing that You know So make sure that it s appropriate If you re in a trauma area then yes definitely If you re in an outpatient clinic unless that patient tells you My veins squirt blood really bad A patient will tell you One time I was doing a finger stick and it squirted and I had on my glasses but I turned my head It hit me in the hair So sometimes the venous flow will do that Good question Cathy All right so got my gloves on first I m going to do is I m going to put the tourniquet on And guys the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it And you re going to put it underneath the arm You need to make sure it s tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you re going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you re going to cause petechiae which is little red patches on the arm I m going to cross my hands over What I do is I put my left hand in position I take my right hand get ahold of the tail of this pull it and then I stick it underneath with my little finger You always want your tails up toward the top so they re not in your area where you re going to clean and draw When I m going to clean well let me show you how to feel first Well it s not going to cooperate today You can use my arm That way they can see better Can you move the Sharps container I m going to stick it underneath there And now it should stay on there Now to locate a vein I m going to take my index finger and I m going to feel back and forth And guys you all can do this on each other Jim s excellent to feel veins on and he s a real good volunteer Bounce back and forth It feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there If it feels really hard like I have one that I ll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard you re not going to get blood out of it It s got to be it s got to bounce So when you go across and you find it then you re going to find which way it travels So you re going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in Some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight So I found my vein Now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute Has my tourniquet been on about a minute Probably so so I need to take the tourniquet off give this patient s arm a rest and then I can talk to them about the weather I can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time and then I m ready to draw blood now So I come in here I put my tourniquet on and guys when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute And I m going to clean I m going to clean in a circular motion and then if you re having trouble with the alcohol you re not able to fan it you can t blow on it and you can take one very clean 2 by 2 go straight down dry it off and then many of you already did that This part of the needle this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it You screw that in take the end off this is a safety needle You anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle that is the pointy part the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin I pull my thumb away as I m going in I take one of these Vacutainer tubes thank you Jim and I push it in And guys when I push in with my thumb I m pulling back with my fingers And you re not able to see but there is and I don t do this in the clinical side but there is blood coming in there You let it fill until it stops Now it s stopped flowing I m going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle the less it s going to hurt the patient Pop my tourniquet and I m going to take a different 2 by 2 than what I cleaned with Fold it lay it on the arm and guys I m just going to kind of hover there until I bring the needle out and push down If I push down while the needle is in the arm it hurts really bad And I m going to hold here and I m going to hold until it quits bleeding And you can peek Now if the blood oh sticky needle engaged It s hard to talk and do stuff at the same time isn t it Sharps And you toss that in the sharps Now if this patient is on blood thinners I ve got to hold longer A lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there put a CoBand on them and send them on their way If they bleed out outside of the lab you re liable And again you re the only one that can protect you So I make sure that they ve stopped bleeding And now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full You guys have been observing Can we ask them to hold it Well you can But what if they don t hold it tight enough What if there s a whole lobby full Jim what have you seen them do in the past and check Yeah You need to check it If there s a whole lobby full sitting out there then you ll get to them when you get to them because you ve got to protect your phlebotomy certificate You re the only that can do that A lot of places they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there tell the patient to hold their arm up That breaks platelets that s going to make a huge bruise and it doesn t really help with the clotting that much just kind of bruises So we re going to look here Okay this patient has quit bleeding so I am good to go here Now another lesson I will teach you about writing on the vials the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there So before you all draw let me ask you a few questions What s your first choice vein Median Median Okay And why do we avoid the basilic Nicole Nerves and tendons Nerves Okay What can happen if I powder on the shirt What can happen if I dig around in there and I do injure somebody What can they do They can bleed or they can have their nerve damage Right And they can come and say This phlebotomist drew here And then guys if you re ever in a setting where you have to go to court they re going to call somebody that s a phlebotomist like you are and they re going to ask them What s your first choice vein And they re going to say The median and they re going to say What s your next choice What s your last choice So you re going to have somebody there that knows You really don t want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice Okay what can happen if the patient s on blood thinners Cassie what s the most important thing to remember about the patient that s on blood thinners To keep pressure To keep pressure Okay How do you clean your site Martika In a circular outward motion Circular you don t ever go back over And how long do you leave the tourniquet on Faye One minute One minute Good job Okay You all get your First thing you do is what Gloves Get your gloves on So you all are going to draw With drawing blood are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to I would if I were you because that just protects you So you can write median You can write an MC median cubital and that way you may actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw And that way they know that you drew from the median That you didn t draw from basilic I need another needle Okay Anybody else need another needle Thank you You re welcome I m going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody Feel their veins feel all the different types of veins Some people have garden hoses is what I call them Some people have very large veins And feel for your vein The tourniquet pinched my thumb The gloves are hard to you trading them out It s this arm Jim I think because I had trouble getting it When I was doing it too Okay Just make it a little tighter with your Oh Did you stick yourself Mm mm Okay I screwed the wrong part I think she s bleeding and I haven t even done anything yet Oh yeah hand me another one There it goes again Okay Casey Let me see what I can do for you Good job Martika Want to just chill how s the weather blah blah blah blah Is it not come undone now You might want to pull your tail just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails It ll stay down Okay It s moving again You re kidding See Okay Just keep going Okay Just keep going It s easier on a person That s my stomach Jim It s hungry Sorry Yeah this one Jim knows which ones stay better Okay you got to anchor your vein with your non dominant with your non dominant hand you anchor your vein I have to stand I can t see you take your thumb and you pull down here Anchor your vein There you go Casey are you left handed too Mm mm I thought you said non dominant hand Non dominant hand to anchor Back it out Put it in this hand Are you right handed Mm hmm Put non dominant hand thumb there anchor Okay Now did you clean it Yep Okay Then go in Uh oh It s okay It s okay Well that s okay Put that on Start over A lot of this is hand movement A lot of this is prac 
 Okay guys I see we ll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication Okay so can you read the objective with me please So I I will be able to do fraction multiplication Okay I ve also put it in Spanish just in case that helps you Okay so the first thing I want to discuss with you today is what do you think about that Do you agree or disagree And then why So one half does one half equal one half Why or why not And then give me some examples Okay Raul It s becuase it is one half They re the same Okay Abraham It s like you cut a pear in half it s gonna be in equal parts Okay so you guys are saying it s equal Yes Okay What do you think Eddie believes he thinks the same thing Taleah what do you think I think it s the same You think it s the same Does everyone think it s the same I do Until you think why wouldn t it be the same Okay so Jose is saying why wouldn t they be the same Okay so one thing Jose says is he s trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn t be the same Joe It s not the same because No that s just the board point Is there a times Nope it s just one over two equals one over two I was thinking it was a half times a half Okay so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it s the same Right Yeah So now how do you explain to me why you think it s the same Why you think it s the same Joe Because they have equal parts Okay Equal parts What do you mean by equal parts They have the same fraction Okay Jose They re both practically the same thing What do you mean by practically the same thing That once you cut a square in half you have equal parts and they re gonna be the same thing Okay Who is someone we haven t heard from Madeline what do you think So I heard you say they are the same right Yeah So why do you think they are the same Cause they re both equal parts and the same cause half equals a half Okay Antonio what do you think Think it s the same So sounds like we re all thinking it s the same okay Abraham what do you think I think they equal the same thing Equals the same thing Okay so now let s take a look at maybe cause it sounds like we re all on the same path here So let s take a look at something else Are they really the same Is that half of a Cookie Cookie Half of a cookie Half a Pizza Are they the same No Yes One at a time cause I m hearing a lot of good stuff but you guys are all saying it at the same time Okay Miguel They re the same cause if they weren t the same is just half So I m hearing they re the same but one s bigger than the other one cause one s a pizza and one s a cookie Yeah Tina you re kind of shaking your head What do you think about that I think they re both the same cause they re still one half they are just different size Victoria what do you think Same or not the same Same cause it s still half Okay so let me ask you this I m hearing a couple things and it s kind of contradicting itself Meaning you re saying one thing but you re also saying the opposite Like I heard it s the same because it s one half but it s different because it s Different sizes different sizes You just told me it s the same but now you re telling me it s different sizes They are both fattening Oh cookies and pizza are both fattening Okay Felice Why I think they re still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it s big or small because it s still chopped in half Okay So if a half of a half so would you rather have half of 10 or half of 100 Half of a 100 Why Because it s bigger Because it s bigger But I thought it was the same No No cause it s the same thing It s still half but you re commenting half of a hundred It has to be the same thing Like the pizza a whole pizza and you cut it in half Okay you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen For it to be half For it to be half But here it s not the same thing You re saying to me that it is equal So which is it So now you re saying you don t think they re the same No You get more pieces than a cookie They re still the same They re still half Okay so who still agrees that the one half equals one half Raise your hand Okay Alright now who says that one half maybe sometimes doesn t equal one half Okay So we got a couple Alright So Delphina what s your thinking I haven t heard from you What s your thinking I think it depends on what you are looking at So in case you didn t hear her Delphina said it depends okay Hear what she said It depends on what you re looking at Cause she said with the money example that you guys well all of you unanimously chose half of a hundred that s 50 as opposed to 5 half of 10 So it does matter So now we just go back to the question does one half equal one half Okay Raul I think one half equals one half I think it s still the same It s not talking about how big it is it s just talking about a half But it didn t say in the question what it was I think the question is supposed to say what it was to say if it s the same or not Okay so what Dallas is saying what Dallas is saying that it needs to tell you what one half is Cause she s saying here the previous question just had the number one over two one over two Equal Alright here she s saying well all of a sudden yeah the numbers are gone but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie So now it s not the same But it s the same question What Dallas is saying in the question it should tell you what is it It s actually like 10 fives five tenths and and one half So what do you think What s your final thought as far as one half equals one half What s your final thought They re still the same it s a half It s still the same because it s half Okay It s the same and different It s the same and different Miguel and they tell you it s different Okay so good question Good question I like the look of that Yes If they are are they the same They re the same it s one half or something One is bigger than the other one Okay Rodrigo What about you bud What s your thoughts on this I m still thinking You re still thinking Or are you still will you compete I m still basically undecided Okay You think they re basically the same So you added that basically Why don t you just put they re the same Why did you put basically Because one s bigger than the other It will obviously still be different Where we re going with this is you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is Your whole unit Okay Alright So that s why sometimes you have to be careful what it s asking you to do Okay Let s go on to the next one Okay so what does one half look like to you So just think right now in your head when you think of one half okay What do you see Half a dollar Half of a dollar Half a fifty Half a fifty Half a gallon of juice Half a gallon of juice Half a body Half of a body Half of a cake Half of a cake Okay Guadalupe what do you see Half a paper Half a paper okay So let me take it to the next step So what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice Does it make sense No Does it make sense No It doesn t make sense So we have to make sure that we know what You have to make sense Well it makes sense but how is it gonna make sense It s what If they re the same If they re the same But what s the same The object The object or the whole unit right Like what is it we re talking about We talking about pizza We talking about cookies Paper Paper Juice People People Eggs Alright so the other thing I wanna talk to you about is does multiplication always make things larger Bigger Yes No So I heard yes yes yes and then No So now then what Cause sometimes it makes it smaller If you do nine times one it s gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero it makes it zero Jessie Did you hear her example No Okay so what she said was cause it s important I want you to make sure you understood She said that no because nine times one is nine Then when you go nine times zero it s zero So it actually made it less right What do you think though When you multiply in general when you multiply does it make things larger When you multiply two things together Yes Okay Abraham It gets bigger because like six times two it s 12 and it gets bigger Okay Raul what do you think Raul V When you multiply does it always get bigger It depends on the number What It depends on the number It depends on the number so give me an example Zero times 8100 is gonna be zero Okay So can we so I m hearing kind of like a lot of you are saying yes it makes it larger But there s still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always Like if we go back to if we go back to that one half if we go back to that one half and that dollar Gino what s 100 times one half Times one half is a hundred and a half A hundred and a half 50 50 I got 150 150 Taylor do you agree One hundred times one half is 150 Raul B 500 Five hundred How d you get five hundred I thought it was half of a thousand A hundred though No more thousand one hundred One hundred times one half Is it 110 Half of 10 is five Half of 10 is five So what is your answer The one hundred times one half Five hundred Five hundred Okay so one hundred times one half is five hundred Tina We don t know because we don t know what one half equals Okay so Tina s saying now you don t know what the one half is What if we re just talking about numbers One hundred times one half what would that be One hundred times one half Let s say it s money A hundred dollars times one half It could be five or 50 If we re talking about 100 then it s gonna be one half of 100 is 35 Okay so 45 there was a lot of people talking so you couldn t hear but Louis is saying it depends but if you re talking about money if it was hundred dollars times one half it d be half of 100 which is 50 Let s take that example One hundred times one half is 50 So then when we multiply that did it get larger No Yeah It got smaller Didn t it You start with a hundred and you multiply and you got 50 which is less So what do you think now Do you think it always makes things bigger No Sometimes it makes it smaller So let s can you give me another example then That s just make sure we prove it Is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then Like five times four Five times four We start with five times four you get what 20 It s a bigger number Okay so that s if you multiply it times a half right Ten times one half Ten times one half would be Five Raise your hand if you think it doesn t always make it bigger It depends on what you multiply it by Alright Very good So we re gonna use the area model to show one half times one half That s a whole One half times one half Abraham says it s a whole but let s go ahead and let s take a look I m gonna go ahead and shade in one half okay And then we ll take a look to see what it actually equals Here s a half There s a half How many squares are shaded both colors One Two One out of how many total Four One fourth So one half times one half is one fourth Is one fourth smaller than one half Yes That s another proof that when you multiply it doesn t always get bigger You could make it into money Like one fourth is 25 cents Alright very good A hundred divided by So let s take a look at another example If we re to use an area models for this what would that look like Three fourth It d be one half right We d see one half times one fourth So what do you think Half of a fourth One eighth Half of a fourth which is one eighth he said One half of one fourth is one eighth do you agree Yeah Okay 
 Okay so tell us a little background about Ed Alright well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious Okay so because of his complaining of chest pains be subtle from conscious or no He called and he talked to the paramedics but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well How do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition Generally it can clog your arteries What can clog your arteries The fat that builds up Okay from being obese Yeah Okay is that one of the I guess physical signs that someone may have a heart condition Yes Okay okay alright Go ahead It is also his blood pressure It said it s at variable levels so that means his heart isn t working properly or consistently So that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system it could damage it It s also another sign of a heart attack Okay so the variable heart or actually the variable blood pressure And some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research You were wondering what did this variable mean and I think what you said is exactly right it s not normal okay They state the variable meaning it wasn t working how it should Okay so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history So tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let s say you ranked who was your number hmm Who was your second who proceeded him Nelson Nelson so you got Ed ranked over Nelson where some other people had Nelson ranked number one so what do you think Well he s unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately and since his heart attacks aren t his title he needs it I think it s important to see to get treatment To get medical care Yeah Okay if he doesn t get treatment what do you think could happen Probably he ll die from the heart attack if he doesn t get treatment or paralyzed What do you mean by paralysis Why do you think he could become paralyzed I m not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not Okay you re not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis Yeah Anybody like to comment on that Question go ahead Jordan It s a stroke It has a brain clot and then that will cause partial I can t say it Paralysis Yeah that word but heart attack You could have a heart attack after that using different parts not paralysis Good point So Jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis What system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis What system in our body is that Nervous system Yeah nervous system Okay understand Doban Jake got that Alright so you guys have Ed you ranked him number one and then you ranked Nelson number two along with quite a few other people It looks like we have some consistencies there Let s look at group B You had Nelson ranked number one but then you did have Ed ranked number three So you didn t think Ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to Nelson and or Monique Well Nelson and Monique had the most critical vital signs They seemed the most the worst because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic So they were not and they were dehydrated too When your body starts to dehydrate that s not it really messes up all your systems So they were What systems Cardiovascular system the respiratory system the immune system everything s just being attacked here because with Eve let me see this his heart rate was way below normal and that s the cardiovascular system His temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon What s the normal body temperature for that of a human The normal temperature is 98 6 and he s at 109 He s at 109 folks Okay I think this was one of our hypers if you remember Nelson and Monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital okay So he s at 109 Isn t this like the immune system Mmhmm Yeah so that s the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down It s at 10 respirations per minute 10 respirations per minute And the normal s like 20 so he s down to half So I think that his vital signs were way more out of whack Did you count in on the blood pressure The blood pressure It s really low and that means his circulatory system s not working right which means blood s not getting everywhere it needs to be Which means he could end up having I don t actually know if it would lead to a stroke but like if everything s not getting blood everywhere his brain might not get enough blood He could have brain damage or something like that It s interesting she said stroke talking about Nelson Was Nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms Seizures It was seizures He was having seizures Is that is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system Absolutely Think about all the systems you just named What s going on with Nelson Cardiac nervous circulatory immune Dehydration Entire bringing in dehydration Digestive not enough water This guy is having a rough time isn t he So if you re pretty confident in why you ranked him number one Yeah Okay comments Anybody Well the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because Monique Yeah because she has a better chance of survival So you ranked him three and it s interesting you said We thought he was going to die He was maybe beyond that point of help Yeah Okay so why d you rank him three Why not rank him seven Well what if he has a shot He s got a chance Yeah Okay he has a chance over Mark That wound to the chest Yeah because Mark got shot in the chest didn t he You d save him though It s interesting you said if he has a shot Mark s the one that got shot He was more stable than Nelson was though Mark was Mark was more stable Yeah Interesting you re bringing in the whole fact of now you re triaging it You re saying okay Mark s a little bit more stable even though he s got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot We don t know what kind of gun it was But I feel like if you rank him a three he s at such a critical position that it s either you rank him one because he needs treatment right away or he s going to die Okay so you re saying he s got to be one based upon all the symptoms based upon his vital signs the condition that he was brought in If you re not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die Is that what you re saying Or early on Like you can t wait too long I guess You ve got to rank him one to three otherwise So he s like what group were you We re F You re F so you had him okay you had him at a two Yeah Okay alright so you re saying he s a top three Yeah especially You had a hand up Oh I was just agreeing with him If we thought we had any chance we should be like let s not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven Okay good point Brian Well were were thinking Speak up a little bit please Well we were thinking that even though he s unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient but compared to like the other ones like Albert or Mark his symptoms weren t that of like great danger as the others and even though his body temperature was 109 that could have been because he was going through heat stroke but now that he s in Asprins they re a cool environment You bring up heatstroke Why do you think he s going through a heatstroke Well I don t know because he was unconscious and they said he was dehydrated and everything Well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like I also figured it d be heatstroke because his daughter Monique Yeah I m sorry Monique it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as Nelson was then it s more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she s going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it s most likely that he is too because they re both in the same environment Very interesting I want to come back to this point Ryan you ve got your hand up What were you going to say I was just going to say that Monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke You re exactly right Now my mind instantly goes somewhere here Jordan your hand was up first I was just going to say that since their temperature s so high they re probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels so just putting them they re going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment Or really cool compared to where they were If they ll put them into more shock which can also be fatal which means they re not exactly just because they re in a hospital doesn t mean they re necessarily going to get better right away Okay obviously they need some treatment You don t want to go from one extreme to the other but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit Yeah They need to get cooled down and what else do they need Water Water lots of water correct Yes You can t really say that Monique s symptoms can apply for Albert too because Monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting So that s probably what most of the symptoms are from We forgot about the bee sting It says she s dizzy nauseousness has cracked lips is having difficulty breathing has a rash on her legs and stomach Okay she got stung by a bee Like you were saying the reason we put Monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee It shows here that with the difficulty breathing the bee sting her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or EpiPen Getting what EpiPen You know what it is Just say EpiPen EpiPen yeah Epinephrine Epinephrine Yes It should elevate them in the largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like respiratory system is closing off she loses her breathing possibly Absolutely she s having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here Here s where my thought went and I said we d come back to this point Maybe Sean you were going to comment or somebody else They re both out in the wilderness this canyon they re both having heatstroke symptoms Actually Monique got stung by the bee she s having separate issues there You don t see anything else different about these two individuals Sean One got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top Do you think that would have a difference in their physical One gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what third of the way Excellent point you know What s the other issue between these two Jack you know Well like they re both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke but Monique got stung by a bee and at the same time Nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms So it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off Interesting interesting Yes Would it be their age Age excellent Look at the difference in their age How old s Monique 18 Yeah she s 18 Nelson the dad right He s 51 I m not saying 51 is old but there s a big difference between 18 and 51 plus the fact you add in what Sean said he s got to hike out of this canyon he s going to try to find help right Is he having to expend a lot more energy Yeah And he s got to go uphill He s go to go uphill yeah It s hot he s got no water he s got to go uphill he s losing basically control of his body No energy no water Erin And that s why we had Nelson as number one and then Monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem but Nelson was having it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything And Monique she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee so it wasn t like so we put her close up to the top because there was she s already been waiting for long enough She needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon So they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they d been struggling long enough Absolutely What During our discussion we were kind of using Speak up a little bit sorry Okay so during when we were discussing the age we were thinking also Monique but Which group were you real quick E You were E okay So like what we thought was that since Monique is 18 years old verses Nelson is a 51 year old well like it makes sense that Monique has a stronger immune system because she s more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas Nelson could be different but we don t know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure It doesn t show but I m just saying in general We were writing specific about his other health because I wrote that down Age related diseases Age related diseases yeah So we re missing some medical history Yeah so it s possible there because he s older and because his immune system isn t as strong as Monique s is we have to like or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter s Absolutely As doctors medical history is so important It s so important in the triage process and we ve been through this folks You know you go to the doctor s office you go into the hospital you know in addition to while they re taking your vital signs what are they asking What are they asking when you go in Medical history Oswell Have you had any previous stuff What s stuff mean Like surgery so like problems Okay other medical conditions Yeah Okay what s another question they ask Very simple Has it ever happened before Has it happened before Is it hereditary Could it be hereditary what s your family s history And I think that s what Brian you were relating to back there What are you here for today Okay let s look back in the chart should I At this moment when he comes into the hospital he s obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped Oh so you re asking about you re referring to Nelson Yeah because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon But because it s so low I would guess that he doesn t have a history of high blood pressure Okay you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it Blood pressure is obviously low I think we addressed this a second ago Why do you think it s low Sarah Because everything else that s going on it s also affecting blood pressure Yeah I think I truly believe with the limited amount of information we have I truly believe that because of the dehydration the heatstroke the no energy no nutrients I literally think this entire body all the systems Shutting down Shutting down I really do think that But it s a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure s 85 over 50 Does anybody has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before Okay 85 over 50 that s low I mean that gets to borderline point where you know you re dizzy I mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system it s not high enough I mean that gets borderline with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up I think his body s just shutting down and you bring up a good point but I think in this case just with everything else going on I think his body s just shutting down Okay Honestly on the side of that besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help During the scenario that he s in high blood pressure like with it s problems that it could cause with it s possible weakens the heart could have actually killed him during the long extended time of trying to get to the paramedics That was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people That this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without And plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there s no possible low levels that could even cause problems True yeah Blythe Like on the graphs I feel like there s Nelson his blood pressure and the blood pressure of Elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas Nelson was 85 over 50 But we just talked about how like Nelson s blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be but with Elder he has a head injury and 
 Today I m going to introduce to you our new project and it s based on the concept of surrealism When you look at this word you should recognize a smaller word within it Does anyone recognize the smaller word Real Real that s right The word real And we know real is the way things really look when we see them or the way they appear But the word sur transforms that word And because this is a French word sur means beyond So now what the word surrealism implies is beyond reality or the way things really appear So what does that look like It looks very dreamlike It doesn t necessarily make sense A lot of different things go on in surrealism and I m going to show you a few examples right now These are the three characteristics that we re going to focus on The first characteristic is out of place objects If you look at this example up here what s out of place in this picture Can anyone tell me Trevor The guy s face What s over his face just floating there Can anyone tell You re up close Matthew You see what that is An apple It s a green apple okay And that is an out of place object Definitely surreal These are examples of surrealism This example right here What s in here Jordan Train There s a train coming out of a fireplace Okay again an out of place object These are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects Another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes Scenes that do not make sense They re beyond real What s going on in this scene Kurt There s like giant butterflies Yeah The butterflies grew They re huge Now they re like the props on the windmills What s going on in this Can anyone tell What makes that surreal John Like huge makeup Yeah the si again the size of such little things grew tremendously and they re filling up the room Also the interior of the room is now looking like the sky So what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really really big The last characteristic that we see in surrealism is there it is Normal objects acting abnormally So in these examples I ll go through real quickly Do you see these clocks They re not acting normally These clocks are melting they re dripping they re stretching they re falling down You can see that In this one the artist drew a person looking into the mirror but does he see his reflection No No The mirror s not operating normally It s surreal It s beyond real What it s doing is it s showing the back of his head And again in this one it s kind of hard to tell but there are three swans and the reflection is of three elephants So the reflection in the water is not acting normally These are three characteristics of surrealism all right So why surrealism Why this style of art Does anyone have any guesses of why anyone or why these artists created something like this Yeah Because it s like a modern form of art Okay yeah That s actually a very good definition Cara Maybe to make it look interesting Okay good To make it look funny Okay good Guys those are all excellent excellent answers Here is another thing that went into surrealism Like lots of art it s influenced by what s going on around it or what happened before it So these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism And the first style of art is known as Dada art This type of art is where the artist took things and they tried to make something that wasn t considered art They took random objects like a bicycle wheel and the stool and put it together and said Okay this is not art And that was an example of the style They also took a famous painting like the Mona Lisa scribbled mustache and a beard There it is That s not art And that was really the whole idea of Dada It was like anti art Another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism Symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something And in this example it s the idea of death There s this dark angel depicted over this man who s already halfway down in the ground All this white snow that symbolizes life around him And it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols And that s what that one depicts The other example or another influence of surrealism is metaphysical painting This one s very very hard to understand and that s what the idea was with the style It was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation Basically one in which you do not know what you re looking at You don t know what the objects are You might know something but you don t know why it s there or what part of it it is And it s very very illogical and doesn t make sense These three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism So when you look at these three styles of art you can kind of see what they led to They led to this style of art which is known as surrealism So now where to start Here s what s going on today Today you are going to start with and you can open your folders up and you ll see this slide What we re going to do is we re going to start drawing today We are going to start by making a connection all right And if you look at this example up here on the board or and you can look at your slides too What we re going to do you can just take your stuff off Leann leave it back there and then join your table okay What we re going to do is I want you to come up with something that means something to you and that s like your theme to start with Maybe it s a hobby an activity a memory anything that s meaningful to you that s your starting point Then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise So these are our options that I just discussed Those are the characteristics Do you want to move it around change the location of it Do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene Or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn t be doing Let me give you an example Lily what s your favorite food Strawberries Strawberries What s your favorite holiday Joe Christmas Jacob what s your favorite animal A dog Okay So this is my surrealist example to you You have a Christmas tree but instead of a Christmas tree you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it So that s kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example These are some examples that I have that I did These are some of my drawings This first one and sometimes you don t even know where these drawings are coming from I wanted to take an object and stretch it I wanted to make it act abnormally So I chose a spoon And what I did was I thought well a spoon needs to catch something So this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops Why Because it s really dry wherever it is You can see all the cracks So that was kind of like my first idea The second sketch that I did was I wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting An unreal scene in an unreal place So what I thought was well pineapples are tropical Why not cut open a pineapple and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees okay You re probably wondering what we re going to do with these Today is sketching but what s going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting This is an example of what the painting might look like when it s all done I chose the pineapple one all right So we are going to be doing a watercolor painting but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting s going to look like Up here on the board I think this is going to help you a lot This is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings and there s a variety of different things that the artist has done They might be food they might be animals they might be instruments they might be people they might be landscapes There s lots of things to look at I want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings I m going to give you paper right now Use this sheet Start with making a connection all right Start with making a connection and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal all right How do you draw hands Hands That s okay hands You know what This is just a sketch So this is a detail that doesn t or this is a part that you don t really need to worry about So tell me what s going on What makes this surreal Um That s what I want to know Because it s the birthday party in the present Okay So which of these options do you think you re focusing the most on This one Okay and why Because a present usually doesn t open Okay so the present so the party is within the present So the present gets opened up and then there s a party Okay What else can we do to make it like maybe a little bit more like bam something going on That s the only thing I was thinking about you know Like maybe Like balloons and Yeah balloons Like they re com they re flowing out That d be really cool All right that s good What should I like do for like for like the face The face on a Baseball Baseball And what are we using for the parts of the face So this is a baseball bat Okay And I Okay These are the baseball bases Oh the bases okay Yeah And this is and this is Okay So you re combining you re combining A lot a lot of different things So why freckles Because like I thought putting more into it would make it more interesting Okay You know what I think would make this really more interesting is the background What s going on around the face Um Think about it Think about it What could we do Where could this be In the sky I don t know So what would represent the sky What could you draw to represent the sky Clouds Try that Maybe draw some clouds I think I think that s going to make your picture more interesting Something like that Because like someone hit a home run Yeah okay And maybe some action lines around the ball You know like a little Yeah That looks really good I like that I like that one a lot A dog eating pizza Okay Brittney Yeah I don t know how to draw horses A horse Yeah Why do you need a horse Because I want to draw like a horse What were you going to do Like A horse A horse with a farm inside of it Inside of it So what do you mean inside of it though Like in here do like a farm and cows and Well here s a suggestion because I like your idea a lot Why don t we we can use this as a resource Why don t we draw I ll help you with this just the back of the horse okay So we ll just work we ll focus on like the neck and the back and then the tail kind of coming down like this okay So you see where I m going with this Now what I m thinking is why don t you draw your farm scene on the back Like almost that it s like kind of been placed on there like a little miniature scene Like so maybe on here you could draw the silo the barn and everything on there Good Eyes on me One two three Okay guys you re doing a really really good job with your sketching and everything and I don t I want you to keep going But we do need to stop for a minute And based on the drawings that I m seeing I see some really good examples of surrealism and you re showing me that you understand it I bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art you could pick out the one that represents surrealism Take a look up here on the board I have three Tabasco sauce posters okay One two three and four Show me with your fingers holding them up in the air which one of these is an example of surrealism Think about it for a minute While you think about it I m going to wiggle my mouse so I can okay What s an example of which one is a Jess Okay everyone had four That s good Why Why that one Why d you pick that one Because like Nope hold on I was going to let Jessie answer first What makes that one surreal Think about it Michael go ahead The sides are like coming off the bottle Okay And the pepper s like putting out the sauce Okay good Anything else Erin It s like out on this like island Yeah definitely definitely Like a lot of things make this one surreal What does surreal mean again Who remembers Me It means like not like like not real but like in a different form Right Beyond real Beyond real Okay And this is a great example of that Beyond reality Okay Here s what I need you to do now okay I have one more Oh I might have to re I have one more slide that I want to show you up on the board and if you open up your folders you ll see this You ll see this slide And I printed it out for you What I m going to have you do right now in the next couple minutes I m going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table You might have to switch three ways or four ways or one way And I want you to assess the drawing that you get Now if you get one that has lots of drawings just pick one of them okay Here s what I want you to do on the sheet This is easy First thing What s the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received Write it down Maybe you noticed a big basketball Maybe you notice whatever it is write it down Then I want you to check these little circles Whichever of these options that you see that that person used I want you to check them out Okay Michael And then I want you to write This is the one that everyone stumbles with They re like What does this mean All I m saying is what do you think that person meant in that drawing What do you think the meaning is If you don t know put a question mark All right And then what suggestions do you have for that person Maybe they you know if you did a background it would look really nice Or maybe you know what Maybe you ve got to lose something You ve got way too much going on I can t tell what it is So this is not going to take you very long but it s important because it shows that shows me that you understand what you re looking at and it also helps the person get a better drawing which is going to be used for the painting So I want you to switch drawings right now Everyone switch And I want you to use the sheet and I want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you re looking at okay So you re going to do this independently and I ll come around and I ll check with you in a little bit That s the first thing that you see Write down the first thing that you see all right So Lily what s the first thing that you see in your in this picture Okay What do you think it is Okay What do you think this is as a whole Don t say anything because I know it s yours But this is good because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to So what s the first thing that you know That you th what do you see Just maybe you recognize it just as water Anything else Maybe a blanket Okay Write that down Okay that s a good start What s the first thing that you saw Almost everything is crooked That s a good ob that s a really good observation Because everything is crooked Good So what options do you think were used in this Now which one did you select Normal object acting abnormally That s right It s clearly these objects are acting abnormally That s good That was a good that was another good observation So you just keep moving through Did you write down your first reaction Mm hmm Okay And okay So normal objects acting abnormally 
Okay But before you check over what you need to make sure you do All of it Get it completed right Okay awesome So your goal would be to Get homework completed Wonderful Okay Excellent Okay Now I brought some extra markers and stuff here because I know you re a visual learner that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your learning styles test So this is for you to do You can choose any colors to make it look however you want Okay So you ve got your goal and then we need to figure out why is that goal important So your goal is to Get all homework done Excellent And why is that important Because when you re in fourth grade you don t get all your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence I ve been there a couple of times and is not very fun and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels hmm So if you don t do your homework You re on a boring fence Okay You have to stand by the fence at recess And if you do do your homework you go to Hotshots Homework Hotshots And that is What do you have to do to qualify for Homework Hotshots Do all your homework for all the Oh Wow So All your homework throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go get to be a Homework Hotshot which means you go to Hot Wheels and enjoy the day skating Excellent Okay So you just brought up a good point umm So this goal is important because not only do you not want to stand by the fence and you want to be a Homework Hero What s going to happen if you do your homework You go to Hot Wheels You go to Hot Wheels and what do you think What effect is that going to have on your report card here If you re doing all your homework what s going to happen to those grades You get all the grades go up like the 100 200 That s right Very good All right So go ahead write that down Why you think homework is important Excellent So this goal is important because you can always get good grades and homework is a way that teachers help the students reinforce the things that they are learning in class So that s an excellent way to get good grades Okay So we know our goal and we know why it s important So let s think about what kind of rewards we re going to get for reaching that goal You get achievement awards You go in a limo with the principal And you go out to eat and Hot Wheels too right So those are some long term goals over the next nine weeks You get to complete your homework the next nine weeks You get to go to Hot Wheels and might even be on the principal s honor roll to take the limo ride Pretty cool huh Okay So that s here We ve got Don t forget one thing that you get to drink soda while you re going You do I didn t know that I ve never been in there I ve never been in the limo but I heard Oh my goodness Well that certainly is a nice incentive something to motivate huh Good So that s kind of a long term motivation We ve got to work hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that right Okay So we ve got here When I meet my goal for the quarter Quarter is another way of saying the nine week time period you will what What do you get to do if you do all your homework over the nine weeks I will go in a limo Well that s for principal s honor roll which is definitely an option What s specific for homework umm When I meet my goal for the quarter I will go to Hot Wheels Go to Hot Wheels Awesome Excellent So the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away can t it Okay Because nine weeks is not easy They are not easy to do your homework Because it s a long time before you go to Hot Wheels and we only have eighteen weeks in school So it s easier sometimes to stay motivated and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on more of a short term basis Meaning that instead of waiting all nine weeks to go to Hot Wheels which you will get to do if you meet your goal Let s think of something that we can do maybe once a week That would be a good incentive for you Study Okay Well studying is part of your homework plan Let s say that you study and you turn all your you do all your homework and at the end of the week when I check in with you when I check in with Miss Butler and I check in with your granny and I d say So how did Annamarie do Did she get all her homework done mm hmm And they say Yes she did What do you think might be something that you re willing to work towards here at school that would be a reward once a week I will come to you and I will help you You d like to help me All right So could we agree that let s say I check in on Fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out did she do her homework What are they going to tell me Yes Yes And then on Fridays you get to come and help me mm hmm That d be wonderful Now I teach a first grade class every day at 12 10 I know you do a really good job helping out at home with your niece But she I do not get to see her Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday But on Friday I do Because my mom My mom watches her And sometimes when my sister and I and the baby s not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and we talk to her on phone Awesome She s lucky to have an aunty like you Awesome Well I know because you do such a good job caring for her that you d be an excellent helper for me and my first graders Will that be a good goal for you Okay So our next section here Can you read this When I meet my goal for the week I will get to go to go to Hot Wheels I think Well Hot Wheels is for the whole nine weeks But each week Remember our What we re working towards on Friday that you get to come Help you Right So you get to come help Miss Charles on Fridays Okay You have very nice handwriting Thank you Okay So do you Thanks Okay So this goal is something that you re in charge of right You re in control of achieving this goal But you re not in it alone Because there s of a lot of people who want to see you reach that goal and to see you doing an awesome job at school So who are some of the people the adults in your life who are on your team who can be helpers for you as you reach this goal My grandma my aunty my uncle my mom and my sister Wonderful You have a lot of people So these are people at home that can help you reach your goal all right So let s go ahead and put those down for supporters at home Awesome All right So you ve got a lot of people supporting you at home I ve got five And how about here at school Who s on your team Miss Butler and Miss Charles You ve got it girl I can t wait to support you on this goal Okay So the people who can help me at school is Miss Charles Is it okay if I put in Miss Ficker my assistance teacher because she helps too Definitely That s a great person to add And so are you Thank you Okay I just realized something What s that All these teachers name has a R in it Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker It s a good attention to detail you have there Okay So we know that our goal is to get all my homework completed Okay And it s important because you can always get good grades Excellent Now on the short term if you re doing a great job getting your homework done every week Each week you will get to come help come help Miss Charles on Friday Excellent And I will know that you re doing a great job because you can ask Miss Butler my grandma and me That s right Okay And over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what s your reward I get to go to Hot Wheels Awesome And then although you re the one in charge of this goal there s a lot of people on your team Who are those people on your team from home My Mama my granny my sister my Uncle TJ and my aunty People on you re side All right And then when you re here at school who s on your team Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker Awesome All right So what do you think How s the school going to go It s going to be great because I will follow all of these Good and I m here to help okay All right Well I think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we manage our time really well And I know we talked a little bit before about kind of your month We looked at the month of February and figured out what big things you have coming up What portions of the day you spend here at school or at Church and what you do how you help out taking care of your niece So that s the month of February So what we re going to do today is really focus on this week and make a plan So what I ve done here is based on the information you told me before we ve got this week starting with today Monday February 7th and you will notice I ve the time of day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till Yeah 10 at night So I have these spaces blocked off So what are you usually doing Monday Wednesday Friday from 7 to 4 Come to school You re at school right So this whole area Is school Is school That s right You re here at school Will you write school Sure Sometimes it s easy for me if I just draw a line to show that Like that Okay School Okay So knowing that you re in school from 7 to about 4 O clock and we also need to think about some other regular things that you do during the week So you told me before that 
 Okay so They re equal because of Right Angles Theorem You are skipping a step Again Trevor tell him the definition of an altitude You tell me I have an altitude You have to tell me then what s the consequence of an altitude Read the definition of an altitude Say it The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle I don t know how to word that right but Somebody help him out He s making sense but somebody Yes Alright It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly if that s a word Don t say through because an altitude is bounded It starts at a vertex and it goes Okay so Now Isaac What should be the consequent step two there Right here Yes Whatever they gave you in those definitions Trevor s and the improved definition by Trey nobody said anything about congruent angles What did we talk That they re both right angles That they re right angles No we didn t That BD is perpendicular to AC Ah ha That s what I got Nice That s what it is So just write on top of that honey Right here Yeah the step two you should have that Right You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that s what reason says It comes from a defintion And why is that because of Tell him Why is that Definition of altitude Definition of altitude Okay You see how when we were working with the picture we put those boxes on the triangle What did those boxes say indicate That they re right angles They re right angles okay So that should be And why do we have right angles Somebody tell me Why do we have right angles Definition of perpendicular lines Yes That s a consequence if you have perpendicular lines So I m going to write ADB and CDB are right angles Yes Yeah Okay You guys the rest of you might have started with the fact that it s an angle bisector right Yeah Yeah And that s okay if you started with that It s okay Doesn t matter You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD You don t have to start with a given but that s traditionally the way we do it I can t believe I got this It s because of It s the definition of perpendicular lines What s this Okay wait Breathe in and out Now let s go see what s going on Okay step to the side ADB and CDB Okay Still you need to have an angle a side and an angle Do you have a congruent angle After all that work I m going to do that now Okay what are you going to put Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles Nope Right Angle Congruency Right Angle Congruency Theory Well I haven t What is the definition of right angle That all right angles are congruent What s the definition of a right angle 90 degrees It measures 90 degrees Yeah yeah All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he s writing Okay let s see what we have If you would number them that would help That s one And what s the consequence for after one I m trying I am old and somewhat blind from here But I know Is that a 2 right under that At the perpendicular line you have 2 What is that AD is perpendic No after that Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB Wait He wrote it It s all jumbled up and it s all there so But wait a minute Let s make sense out of this because it has to flow okay You know when you have your perpendicular line What should be at the perpendicular line The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines is what That the angles are Somebody somebody That they re right angles I want to say that but then I just don t want to say something that s wrong No you re fine You were not here yesterday And it seems you re doing great Hey so take the blue marker so that everybody can see Take the blue marker because I would like to re number it so they can see it okay So re number them again One is the given the altitude So you want me to write over Yes And then that s two Now what should be three Don t put three on that one What should be three Somebody tell him What should be three The angles The right angles Yes Okay now honey after you have right angles what are you going to say That uh Definition of Right Angle Theorem No Okay so right angles What happens after right angles Because remember angles are angles I need to talk about angle congruency But you haven t said that You talked about right angles So now what are you going to say You have it there honey Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE Okay so that should be the next step That s four Okay you remember Good Great Remember when I asked you at the beginning when we first started doing proofs to keep track So you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle Yeah right here Not yet we haven t touched that guy yet We don t even have a number for that guy He s just floating in there What angle is congruent to what angle Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle Yeah ADB is You just did right Okay go cross out one of the As I don t think you specifically did this but I ve noticed that some of you I ve noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you Taylor that you were always After you prove something you found it within your proof You would kind of cross it out in here Okay I found this Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here It s like you re taking attendance I need angle for an angle I already have an angle Keeping going See what I m doing here I showed you this way back Yeah He s probably getting confused because of number three How he put ADB because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB Wait what what what Number three The original number three Yeah The B should be in the middle instead of D It should be ABD and DBC That s right That s why That s why Yeah I didn t noticed that Yeah I thought he put that You guys are smart Yeah that s how you got confused with everything else Okay so now segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property so that s another side And then it s given that BD is an angle bisector so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD Okay but the issue here is he hasn t listed that as a given right Just like people say Well you re making that up How do you know that And you just say It s given but you didn t write it Yeah he did Yeah yeah he did It s right there It s number four He just did it wrong It s backwards It s all there So that should be step Wait a minute One two three four five Four should be one Whoa Three should be two One should be So there s a one two three four and then five Wait five right here Six right above it six seven Okay can you change the numbers Fix the numbers Yeah please fix the numbers It s there Okay we got it We have an angle bisector the consequence of an angle bisector We have an altitude the consequence of an altitude We have reflexive property so do you have them all Yeah So what could you say now The triangle I m going back to the black marker Okay let s get him out of the hot seat okay Micah Yes Micah You tell us is he finished with the proof No Why Because you said no Who said no You But okay you re supposed to tell me if there s something Well you have to put that it is the I don t know Frank to the rescue He hasn t proved that it s isosceles yet And how do you prove that it s isosceles I don t really know That sounded so tough Frank Yes Okay you say segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C Wait how do you say it CPCTC Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent I always mess it up I can t do the CPC I can t do that I say the whole thing Okay now Frank is he finished I think Is he No Not yet No he s not Okay why Tell him why Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC So what should be his number 10 Triangle ABC is isosceles And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle Yes I m so proud It keeps getting better I told you it would get better Teamwork I was stressing last night because I was like it s so hard Okay you guys understand what this means but I m trying to hurry it Good job Isaac Yeah Isaac a good job Very good Isaac One big clap for Isaac one two three Alright Yeah You did good Okay so You know what This is the proof that the new program where I give you because I want to make sure you get it enough information to do this on our own okay And then I m not going to write it out We re going to talk about how to do it And then you re going to complete it tonight at home So what do we need to do What is given there Jonathan What s given The middle one This one honey CB is an angle bisector of ACB CD is an angle bisector of ACB Okay what does that give you Once you have an angle bisector No that s not it Don t look at that one That s a totally different proof This is one that I m going to give you tonight So what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean 
 What note are we going to start the question with for bell Marilyn Doe it s going to end that note is F thank you What are we going to end the question with What are we going to end the question with Josh Anything but doe Anything but doe What are we going to start the answer with Start the answer with Paige Yeah you can actually start with doe okay So this is really anything okay And then anything else for anything in between Got it What part We have 15 R s And we have a five note scale Abby The C s and the E Big it There we go Eggs and bacon are coming off Two eggs whoops one bacon Here we go John before you go to your instrument boys and girls Yeah well my shoe fell off Can I have these two rows speak the question and these two rows speak the answer Just so we solidify the rhythm Ready Speak in pack speak in pack Ready set speaking first Valentines valentines Pink red and blue Now you I made a pretty one just for you Switch please Question answer Ready begin Valentines valentines Pink red and blue I made a pretty one just for you Okay two jobs when you get to your instrument Remove eggs and bacon by drawing your fingernails down the nail and pulling towards you Job number one always in this classroom is not to talk while I m talking thank you Job number two make your X One take off bars Two make your X Ben J That s my instrument Thank you I m going to move it now Yeah there s Okay I ve already set my instrument anybody not get a turn on the basses yet this year Not had a turn on the basses yet Everybody had a turn I haven t Yeah you have Okay let s have Josh and Britney go to the back row and start their jobs Oh my gosh we do not have time Go That row may go Okay you re about two seconds too late on that Your row may go now Draw your finger to the top of the nail and pull it towards you Sabrina Egg oh they re wrong Okay eggs and bacon Agata s row may go And the last row may go How come on this it says H equals B Cause in Germany they don t have B they have H We have instruments made in Germany Josh is ready Britney s ready Ben is ready Abby s ready All right boys and girls You have two does on your instrument two F s Would you locate one yes You have two F s locate one and hover both mallets above one Hold question on F Speaking and playing alternating bounce C Ready set and here we go Stop we gotta do it again because Josh remembered half way through that he was supposed to speak while he played Let s try it again Josh Ready set and here we go Excellent Answer on the other F Hold answer on the other F Ready set and here we go Yeah we re going to try the answer again just some of you might have messed up the rhythm Ready set and here we answer Make your X This time you re to do the question again but you may use two bars this time But we have to start beating the question on what mill F F so one of your bars must be F The other bar has to be next door to F in either direction Here we go Question only Starting on F only using two bars Ready set and here we go Uh oh what are we not supposed to end the question over Dawn F F this time you may use your whole instrument for the question you have to start on F but don t end on F Ready set and get question here we go Good didn t hear anybody end on F I did make your X for a second I heard some people s questions that maybe sounded like this I don t really remember what notes I played I was just kinda doing whatever I wanted to up and down up and down Could I sing that No Valentine valentine Probably not But if my question sounded like this Could I sing that Probably Did I use some patterns in that like a good musician I did Valentines valentines Pink red and blue Okay Try it You don t have to do the same thing I did but let s do some repeated notes let s use some patterns and let s not be all up and down our instrument Ready set and here you go Not bad Let s try the answer boys and girls Start at any note you want but end on N And let s make it memorable and singable Something you can remember something you can sing I made a pretty one just for you Ready set and here you go Not bad not bad Here s what I would like to have happened I m going to ask the question Tyler s going to give the answer I m going to ask the question Amanda s going give an answer I m gonna ask the question answer question answer question answer question answer And then the next row we re going to switch Paige question me answer Kia question me answer you get it Okay Yay Shh Paige would you mind before we begin arrowing over to the last slide I want to show you what I am looking for Yeah go for it When you are doing yeah keep going When you are doing your question or when you are keep going Sorry keep going That s it okay Here s what I m looking for Are you alternating your mallets Are you bouncing your mallets Are you doing the correct rhythm Did your question start on doe if you re the question Did your answer end on doe if you re the answer Was your melody memorable and singable Here we go My turn first so we ll go question answer down the batch feels and you get it Todd I forget the I made this pretty one just for you Paige question is ready here you go Do I start this time Yeah you start this time Yeah you re going to do the question now I m giving you the answer Now question answer question answer Let s actually do this Question answer question answer Question answer Ready Britney Josh you get ready to do the answer Ready Britney here she goes Oh you know what Ben it sounded like the end was ended on a doe Oh yeah All right you want to try it again That s why Eli was like Oh Yeah okay Ready go Good Sabrina go It s um Question Okay Nice job Now some of you didn t get a chance to do the question or didn t get a chance to do the answer Right So here s what I m going to have you do And we have 30 seconds to do this With the person next to you one of you do the question one of you do the answer okay Let s try it together Ready set and here we go Answer Nice Here s the beauty of the pentatonic scale boys and girls No matter if we re doing a million different things at the same time if we re all on different bars the notes of the pentatonic scale sound so good together that you can could be playing something else and it still sounds musical 
 Who s gonna do the skyscraper So we got to put size color and shape Size color and shape Ok I m gonna do a skyscraper Beau is that for the past or the present That s for the present Skyscraper Present the present The present ok And the pyramid is for the past Yeah And you ll do a pyramid for the past I was gonna do a log cabin That s what I was gonna do But we have to use different things because we don t got no logs Well actually they still make log cabins now We can use brown for the logs Jonathon says they still make log cabins now They do Yeah they do We don t really make pyramids any more do we No Yeah but they could be hidden in Egypt Yeah but there is four lines What we gonna do with the other two What I want you to do is list three details Color size and shape So what shape will your skyscraper probably be A rectangle A rectangular prism A rectangular prism That s what Dillon said Rectangle Rectangular Prism Okay Then you can talk about your pyramids Ask them they re your team A square pyramid Triangle Oh he said a square pyramid Yeah let s do it A triangle You think it should be a triangular pyramid Yeah I m with Dillon Well talk about it Which one do you want to do I thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid You know because it has four sides It does have four A pyramid only has four sides Well a triangle has four too It does One two three four That s a square honey because it has four Well if it has three sides how many sides does it have Three Three So you have to decide So we could take a square and make it like a Dillon agrees a square pyramid too I love having y all together Let s do square pyramid and rectangular prism Good deciding Alright What are you guys discussing right now We re discussing what all we wanna do I like that Okay We re not sure what play we re doing You re not sure what play you wanna do Because everybody keeps picking everything So how are we gonna figure it out But I agree with Randy So what do you guys agree on I agree with my plans He wants like an old time car and I don t agree with that But we don t understand how you do an old time car How do you do a play or skit about an old car That s what you need to tell them The only time Okay Aaron said something about the classroom and that I was going to be the teacher Or something like that I wanna be assistant teacher Randy likes that And this is two people from the past and two people from the present Hear what Jacob said Jacob wants to be assistant teacher You re the teacher assistant teacher So when will that be in the past or the present Present Haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and Randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too And then we ll come to where they are then they ll have to show us what changed Did y all hear Aaron s idea You can say that to them I like Aaron s idea Listen to what Aaron just said guys He has an idea that you may want to do Ian and Jacob and Haley are from the present And me and Randy are from the past and we come And they show us all the stuff that has changed I agree with Aaron I agree with Aaron I agree with Aaron Or we could do like you two are teachers and like me and Aaron and Ian are like students And then them two teach us Oh that s an idea You could do But then how do we do the past Well but you could do the past and then how could you do a skit about the past and a skit about the present Yeah They would be the same except one is the past and one is the present To where like no one had desks and then in the present we have desks Oh What do you think Ian I wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future Well are we doing the future or the present Present Well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present Okay Well decide It sounds like you got some really good ideas Why can t we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present And you choose your own people who live in the present Well Ian if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea Yeah you choose your own people but you do it in the present Sounds like y all have to just keep on You may just have to make a decision Ok You may just have to make a decision Sounds like you are doing great guys How do you spell transfer trucks Huh How do you spell transfer trucks Transfer trucks Let s sound it let s tap it What letters T Trrr A N C E R or something Trr like tree T R You got it Shannon Did you hear Shannon Let s tap it Ta jarius Trr Aaa A What letter is that Nnnn N Ssss C K S Ssss Transssss S I got S F F How do you make er at the end of a word E R You got it There you go and you know trucks So what are y all doing with transfer trucks I don t know He s the one who wanted to write it Why was this on Noah s desk Case has some names Yeah Ok but what But why did y all um You re describing what each persons job will be And I have that Noah and Ta jarius and Madison are gonna do what The waves What kind of waves What are y all showing from the past and the present I wanna do waves in the present Do waves change from the past to the present Do you mean like ocean waves Have those changed over time I m doing transfer trucks What s it suppose to be A I m doing transfer trucks How have those changed over time Horses carried them with like umbrella s over them Very cool And we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier And you said that was like a truck You could pull that up back up there I could pull it back up Do you wanna see that again Cash do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time Shannon what are you doing What are your illustrations gonna be showing change over time She might do cars or something Do you wanna do cars You don t have to do cars You don t want to Lots of things have changed over time You can actually buy food and not hunt it How do you spell Shannon That s one of the things you could draw the change from the maybe you ll do washing machines Yeah Yeah that works Yeah Cars change Do you wanna do transfer trucks No You re already doing them Guys Do you wanna do washing machines Madison Draw a washing machine next to that You wanna do washing machines Can you hold that up so they can see it because Shannon can t see it Where did ya wash your clothes at Turn it over like this and you d rub them against here Different isn t it Yeah When I was little my great great great great great great great grandma grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when I was big I was allowed to see it Very cool There was a picture Alright It sounds like you ve got some work to do guys I love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time I think we need to think about waves though because waves are a natural thing People don t really build and change those do we No so we need to think about something that has changed over time And don t forget our books Buildings Buildings Buildings have definitely changed over time Alright guys Keep it up you are doing great Alright let s see what you guys are up to Okay what s going on over here Well we re thinking about About Cassa coloring Ann coloring and me coloring and drawing and her drawing I love drawing You love drawing That s what I love I love typing at home I love all of it Very cool Alright so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing We re gonna show the style the color Okay can you tell me what you re gonna draw We re gonna draw dresses Oh dresses And shoes Like dresses and the shoes that they would wear I can get my old dress My mom s old dress she s got I have it and I can design it You can Uh huh So are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present Yes Or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present We re gonna do it all together I love that Them two are coloring I m coloring and me and her are drawing Very nice You re drawing Yes we re drawing I m coloring Very very nice Well it looks like you guys are ready for your next page Let me ask you this how has clothing changed over time The color has definitely changed The colors have changed And the shoes Ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses Oh so they used to wear really long dresses and now They have short dresses that come up to here Yeah and shoes they wear lace up boots Laced up boots I think my mama has them I won t be able to wear them but I might be able to bring them Oh that d be cool if you bring those It sounds like you have great ideas And they wore hats back then cause I m thinking about my mom s dress I mean I can design it I am very very pleased with how much you ve accomplished together in your group let me get you the next sheet Okay We all have our things done and we re going to get it And we all have each others phone numbers Here s the next sheet Let s look for a second Who will design the piece from the past and Who will design the piece from the present Now that doesn t mean it has to be separate Right you can take it home Well me and her Well it sounded like we re all okay Yeah we re all basically doing it Okay Why is this change important to people today and How could this continue to change in the future Hmmmm There s some questions to think about So have you worked on this some more You ve decided to what you re gonna do Skyscrapers and pyramids They re doing the pyramids me and him is doing the skyscrapers Them two are doing the pyramids we re doing the skyscrapers That was nice Good going coming up with that Good job We re doing a square pyramid You re doing a square pyramid Yeah That s easy all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top So when I was with you before you said this is hard we don t know what we re gonna do and all had different ideas and as it turns out this is kind of easy What made it easier Working as a team Working as a team Dillon would you mind sitting over here sweetie so that everybody can hear and see what you re doing Yeah Kinda off by himself over there huh sweetheart Alright the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is How has this changed over time Buildings how have buildings changed over time Pyramids pyramids been tooken down Did we ever build buildings out of gold No I got something Pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in Eygpt like more land Okay What about buildings in general How is this building different from McWilliams It s bigger It s bigger and has more space Which one is bigger McWilliams And it s newer It s newer so how do you It s newer or it s smaller He says it s newer 
 Like compared to osteoblasts the osteoclasts to be more efficient and work harder than the osteoclasts therefore you re more than you are building so that ratio can cause brittle bones So what Okay right Yeah One s up one goes down Yeah if you re taking away more than you re putting back No I m sorry why don t osteo Cause there s a lack of estrogen and or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work We kind of hit on that a little I don t know I kinda did but I kinda didn t What causes osteoblasts to work That it Okay so when they re saying that the osteoclasts are working more what they re not saying more than they used to work they re saying more compared to the osteoblasts okay It s not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity They re just doing what they do It s just because the blast activity dropped which you guys got that the blast activity dropped Why did that blast activity drop Because there weren t enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting Good Is everybody get that Cause see now the blast activity s what s really dropping And the clast activity keeps going like it normally goes but relative to one another you have more clast activity less blast activity and therefore you re losing bone Everybody got that idea Okay good you did a good job reasoning that out Okay you can keep going Matt Okay our next question kind of gets off of like the description of osteoblasts and it says How can osteoblasts or how can osteoporosis be prevented Brooke Well they recommend having like a good number a good amount of calcium intake a day about 1 000 1 500 milligrams you could do that something simple like that could prevent like osteoporosis in the long run All right I would also suggest regular exercise in order to kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise so that there s less there s more bone actually broken down Basically a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk Along with everything else there s a I went to the Food and Drug Administration you can have Zoledronic acid which can be injected every two years for like prevention along with the diet and exercise Anybody else have anything they d like to add I was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other Nobody else Okay Now who s on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed Yeah I found the most current one is a form called Dual Energy X ray Reabsorption Test to test the bone density you get a score of either one or below means you re normal one to 2 5 is osteoporosis 2 5 and above it s just your bones are gonna break any time All right Anybody else There s just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density so there s like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative that s what they use cause it s like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not so you kinda need more ways to test Good You can also take a sample of your and analyze it to see if there s any signs of erosion or anything that ll lead to osteoporosis Okay what s that called Anybody know what that s called What is it Bioscan Good Before you even go to the doctor like it s really hard to diag like there s not really symptoms of it But some of the symptoms are like bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that and breaking bones with little or no trauma What do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma What kind of fracture Traumatic Traumatic would be if it was kind of trauma Pathological good job yeah Pathological fracture that would be a pathological fracture if there s a disease under there like osteoporosis which has made it weak enough to break Good call So somebody mentioned the scanner Zach right You talked about that The abbreviated what did what was the full name of that scan again Dual Energy X ray Absorption Okay has anyone ever heard of a DEX scan DEXA scanner that s where the D E X comes from Dual Energy X ray DEXA scan and that s very common yeah Is that like what the guy from Pursuit of Happiness Yeah I don t know if you ever saw that movie I didn t Yeah the bone density scanner I didn t know if that was it Yeah okay so how did they what the general how they actually what bones do they look at in the scanner I think it was the wrist the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis The lumbar part of your spine because that s the first to go Why What else is important to consider if you if you think about the type of bone being affected what type of bone being affected What type of bone I should remember Trabeculae Yeah so that s a spongy bone right So trabeculae of the spongy bone why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now It s a spongy bone Yeah it s an irregular shaped bone but the body of the vertebrae is basically a cortex in and it s a spongy bone in there it s all trabeculae What was the other bones that you said Madhura Wrist and hip Okay so hip as in what do you mean by that do you think Robert Ilium Ilium It s all a spongy bone A spongy bone in the ilium good place to look for it But here s the thing what about the wrist How come think from a practical scenario how come the wrist Yeah Lexi I think it s cause you use it like so often that they is probably the most common because you use your wrist for like basically Do you use it a lot Another possible reason Yeah Kevin Because it s a lot of like small bones so they may be easier to break or like be more fragile Okay that s a possibility Mikey I would say cause it s easy to get to like it s pretty hard to take like and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip It s kinda hard to get like a good angle but like your wrist can there s not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture Okay thank you for that That s exactly why they use the wrist I mean the wrist bones when you think about em you know they re not weight bearing so they re probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones but they do have spongy bone in them they re little irregular shaped bones which have a cortex with some spongy bone So there is some material in there to evaluate but you don t have to disrobe you don t have to do anything you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what s called a screening a screening test Has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before Or thought of ever heard of screening tests being done for other things No Not familiar with the screening tests I think I ve had one Have you Yeah because if I had like it wasn t for bones though It could be for anything Like they were looking for appendicitis but they couldn t find it so they were doing other all these other kinds of tests I don t know if that Well a screening test it could be it could be a screening test Screening tests are basically more generalized testing not the most specific but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation okay So if you put your arm in the scanner and it was towards the low end it s not the best for making an end all you know quantitative diagnosis But it s a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium you see So that s why the arm So it s interesting that you brought that up that was really good cause it really helps us look at the whole Where is this occurring and Why do they use those specific bones Okay Matt anything else there Our next question we have already said how it s diagnosed we know what it is So how can we treat osteoporosis Well I said I found online that there were really no treatments like true treatments for osteoporosis It s more of trying to prevent it by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before because you can t really treat it once it s gone Well that s funny I found something a little different there s a few medicines right now like talking about you ve seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it Now they re actually saying like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you ve lost from the bones But it s also something kind of funny I saw if the bones start to become more dense they also found that like around your jaw starts to deteriorate faster some reason actually get like sore throat So I was wondering if anyone try to reason that out Because I could not figure out why just your jaw starts losing calcium but your long bones start gaining it Are you saying that they re taking medication and then they re experiencing pain So that Yeah like the calcium to deteriorate But like your long bones it s like your limbs and everything start to become more dense Is your jaw a lot of is it one of those bones Yeah some but there isn t a whole lot in there there is some Is it a more compact bone Probably a more compact bone in your jaw there isn t a lot of cavity space or spongy bone space there Maybe that has something to do with that Even having a sore throat I don t know why that would affect it at all Maybe because it s a horrible medicine I don t know like the thyroid gland like this one or the parathyroid this is like calcium like bone absorption so maybe I don t know it s not working as efficiently so it s not getting the through to the jawbone Or maybe it s working too much or something Maybe since your jaw is losing calcium and it s kinda gaining like losing its calcium so it s probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis Your hyoid bone isn t your hyoid bone isn t it Sort of high It doesn t really touch any other bones but it s kinda in there So it s kinda in your throat so that could be like I don t know it s kinda unusual Just answer this one with the general area cause there s a lot of instances where you couldn t sit or lay down for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus So I don t know there were a lot of really bad side effects just Well what I was wondering I kinda see like some doctors like just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention would be the other side to treatment just go do like those lifestyle changes Instead of like thinking Oh I ll wait until these signs come up and have platelet scans and I ll take medicine Just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don t drink excessively and like have those good workout regimens so you prevent it rather than treat it Yeah seems like a disease that s either prevented or managed not so much treated but I thought I think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids for like asthma like in your inhaler So it s something that inhibits bone breakdown so it doesn t sound like it treats it but it kind of manages it so you don t break bones Yeah did anyone request a name a name brand Fosamax Did we see that Yeah Did they tell you how it worked No actually No well Fosamax is like did you see something there Zach Yeah wasn t that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo osteo something bone reabsorption So they re inhibiting which cells Osteoclasts Okay yeah so that s how Fosamax and those work They inhibit the osteoclasts so they re not building bone though You see the difference Yeah They re not really building the bone they re stopping the erosion it s a little different But if you have like dead bone or old bone that needs to be replaced wouldn t that just inhibit it just as much because there s still old calcium sitting in your leg that I don t know whenever there s waste in your body that doesn t get dealt with I mean like when you have an appendectomy and there s waste in your appendix that like it can kill you if there s like waste in your body So maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis not so much as help it in the long run I m thinking cause any time you re keeping like something that s old in your body that s not good Like you eat something you have to like you have to digest it and I don t know Yeah it s a good thought process Good thought process So that s what Fosamax works that way So if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps let s say someone who has osteoporosis let s assume they have it now What types of mechanisms in other words what types of things will we try and get a drug to do What would we want it to do You want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better And someone already mentioned this but they had like estrogen supplements like supposedly like help out with that Maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability Okay well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement Did anyone request that as a therapy Yeah Kevin And there s like these like it s like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches where you can take it as a pill So it adds estrogen to your body so it balances out your loss of estrogen and raises it Yeah there s like he was talking about the hormone replacement but I also read on Google Health that it s rarely used and it s not used twice with women I don t know if that has anything to do with it I can Google it I guess like if you use the treatment once Any ideas why Anybody find out why estrogen replacement they used to you know what They used to give estrogen like they give vitamins it used to be prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen Seriously and it wasn t all that long ago how come it isn t get Because then your body stops producing its like natural estrogen so Good idea maybe Any other poss Nick any idea you can think of I don t know you re not producing enough So because you re not we should get more well how come have anybody heard of anything that s related to estrogen therapy bad things Facial hair growth Well testosterone can increase facial hair growth someone else over here Cancer Cancer and that s the problem they saw incidences of particularly breast cancer went up substantially and so that s why Artie they re saying that you know hormone replacement it s still being used It s rarely used Yeah but not like it used to be not like it used to be So if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly or blasts to work properly then shouldn t you like have like some sort of treatment to like make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts We would have like sort of a difference in their relationship Good idea But isn t that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone So shouldn t we find a way to like make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone Because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they re stimulated But they have to be stimulated so show me if you re looking for a way to stimulate them more than make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes No that would be more like a genetic thing cause your osteocytes your DNA is like breaking down as you get older So it s like not it s like I don t know is it mutating When it gets older I don t know a lot about genetics but I know your DNA kinda breaks down as you get older and so that makes your cells not as efficient So it might be more of a DNA kinda thing Where you have to engineer that DNA wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you re like 78 as when you re 12 So it might be in like that area but I don t know a lot about that so Yeah it s interesting where you can go with it All right You can take this because even Artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat What were you saying about that I don t know maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland I don t know maybe it like produced too much I don t know the jaw bone and it reached the jawbone first and I thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to the rest of the body So which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines Maybe that s why your jaw s if you release a lot of that hormone then it s building your jaw up and when you re building bone you get growing pains Maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw Maybe 
 Okay Now when we sang that music scale we were We were actually stepping up We were going from low to high And if you ll look over at this you can tell these were the notes that we were singing from low to high The first note was a line note Let s speak it together Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Good job Those notes were stepping And if you ll notice here I ve got carpet squares and I have them with line note and space note Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Good job That s what we sang when we sang our scale and that s the notes that you re seeing up there are those line notes and those space notes All right I d like for us Will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it Sit behind the carpet square of your choice And let s go ahead and sit up tall on our knees Sit nice and tall on your knees And the next person come in and find a carpet square sit behind it behind that hand chimes And I don t think we ll need We ll need one more person The next person What about me Five Good job All right Now everyone even if you re sitting in your chairs you need to practice with me because we re all going to be playing the hand chimes today Do not touch your hand chime just yet Let s all just practice Start off with your hand up Put your hand chime down a second We re going to just practice with our arm only And it s going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that s going to make a difference in the way that it sounds All right watching me Hold and again Hold Hold Asanti Hold Hold Okay stop Now people down here pick up your hand chime and let s see if we can get that technique going Get ready One more time Good Now let s Just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop Good Now when I point to each person by yourself you will play the music scale So do not play until I point to you Looking at me we begin Start with the low C Good job Let s do it again That s the scale And these notes are stepping because it s line note space note line note space note Any time you ve got two notes beside of each other that s a stepping melody One more time starting with the lowest C Good job Now put your hand chime down a second We just heard a stepping melody Any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other two neighbors playing that s a stepping melody I want you to stand up please and I d like for you to stand up Take your hand chime hold it and That melody Someone raise your hand and tell me What did it do Logan Skipping Actually It leaped You re exactly right It leaped Because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play That s a leaping melody Good job London do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping I mean leaping and skipping Can somebody help us What s the difference between a leap and a skip If you leap it s more than a skip All right The leaping is more than the skipping Skipping All right You sit down Put the hand chime down And you stand up You keep remaining standing Take your hand chime and you play That was a skip You are exactly right That s a skip when you just skip over one place one person All right Have a seat You have a seat And I d like for Ashley you stand up And what I want her to do is for four times I d like you to play your hand chime watching me I m going to let her try Someone raise your hand What was that James what was that Repeating You re exactly right That was a repeating note The one person that one pitch played four times All right Sit down please Now will you please stand You stand and you stand Watching me All right Raise your hand please Tell me what was that Devon Stepping A stepping pattern And it went from high to low You re exactly right Have a seat Now last week I gave you a piece of paper and it was something that I wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping stepping and repeating on the music scale If you ll look over at the Smartboard there is some notes there on Number 1 some notes on Number 1 And you were last week going to circle an S if it was a stepping pattern You were going to circle an R if it was a repeating pattern Raise your hand if you know what those notes on Number 1 were doing Christian put your hand chime down and you can come up and circle whether those notes in the Number 1 if they were stepping or if they were repeating You re exactly right Christian How did you know that It was staying on the same note Staying on the same note very good And thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes Number 2 Akrista can you walk around that other way and come right here And why don t you show us Put the hand chime down please Show us what the notes in Number 2 are doing Let s see if it s doing a space note and then a what Line note Line note and then a space note And she is exactly right Those notes were stepping what Down Down And Number 3 Thank you ma am Come this way right around here And she s looking at those music notes and she s going to be able to tell They re right here Number 3 All right Let s say it with her Line note Space note Line note space note Line note Right here Are they staying all the same No They staying all the same What are those notes doing They re stepping You re exactly right They re stepping up Thank you ma am And tiptoe back to your seat Very good job Now I would like for the last two people B and C If you ll tiptoe to your seat I m going to call you back up here in a few minutes The rest of the folks you ve got to be sitting up nice and tall sit up tall on your knees Let s see if they can play a very familiar tune I want you looking at the very first note the The very first note Keiani You have that low C And what do you notice about C C Keiani what s your note going to be doing What s the word when you have the same pitch Re peating Thank you He has a repeating note And G Christian what are you going to be doing Repeating Repeating Adam what are you going to be doing Repeating Repeating So we have a lot of repeating notes in this song Sit up tall on your knees Sit up tall Pick your hand chime up We re going to see if we can play this familiar tune Waiting One two ready sound Very good That was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star It was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star You recognized it All right Put your hand chime down a second I was listening You heard the melody All right Now let me see Sitting tall I m going to get someone that s sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit I think I would like for Christopher Will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody Oh don t raise your hand We ll let Christian choose Three people that would be able to play Christopher Oh yeah Christopher Or you can call him Chris That s Christian All right Tell me which three people Just point to them All right He s pointing to you Stand up with your hand chime We re talking about stepping now Stepping All right Okay Chris has pointed to these three tapped them on the shoulder Let s see If you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern will you just gives a thumbs up silently You re exactly right he did pick He did it He did pick three All right Put your hand chime down and sit down I d like to call on Harmony Will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody Leaping So you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder Leaping Leaping Leaping Okay Now these two people are side by side There s a line note and a space note and they re neighbors Someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play What would they be playing if they re neighbors That would be a stepping And I wanted a leap like a frog leaps over a whole lot So come and see if you can fix it Real quick Somebody needs to sit down Who do you want to sit down All right Sit down And pick somebody that will be a leaping melody Like a frog leaping leaps over a whole lot All right He stands Take your hand chime Play Now she leaped over a space note and a line note Give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly Yes that is a leaping melody Good All right Sit down Hand chimes still on the floor I d like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair What we did in that song we had several times that there was repeating notes We had a few times where we had some stepping side by side And we had some leaping melodies When we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies the melody If you re playing a xylophone though you could do it right by yourself I can I would like Keiani will you step around behind here And Sheridan you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose And Dev Devuan Devuan walk around here Walk this way And he s going to be the teacher I want you to choose Sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do Choose something that you want them to play and let them see it Turn it so that they can see it All right What do you want them to play Step Play a stepping melody All right Good and stop Now someone Both of them did do a stepping melody But he was playing right here Can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better A hit in the middle He says Hit it in the middle Hit where the music notes are those steps Let s try it again Play em soft Great job That is stepping All right Choose another one Oh now he wants a leap Good job What do you want Devon Devuan Devuan Repeat Good job All right thank you Put your mallet right there on the instrument Lay it on the top That will be quicker for today And tiptoe back to your seat walking around the instruments I d like for Wes H to step around and find yourself a xylophone Step around over here Akrista Sit down tall on your knees And what do you want them to play Tell them She wants you to play a repeating note Now those were both kind of high repeating notes very high Do you think you could play a low one Good job Now how did you know that was going to be low Akrista Cause the little ones are higher Bigger ones are low You are exactly right What else do you want them to do She d like a what 
 Who came up with the definition for radiation Peter you had a good definition could you repeat that remind us I don t remember it exactly but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move waves that are radiated I mean Didn t you say it was waves that are spread Yeah waves that are spread by something and they usually have energy with them Like the sun sends its radiation to the earth in the form of light heat UVA UVB rays Okay so with that understanding would you guys say that all radiation is harmful Not all Yes To a degree all of radiation is harmful But just it depends on how harmful But so then what is like when it s not harmful It s very very very Not almost It s almost negligible What types of waves that radiate or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful Radio waves Any others Jordan Microwaves Visible light Yeah visible light isn t really that harmful What about microwaves that s a good one What do you guys think about microwaves I thought they were dangerous but somebody told me that they weren t They re not really that harmful are they I mean You probably shouldn t stand in front of it Saying they re not that harmful They re not I mean I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad but I think that could be the same with a lot of things The door shuts when you use the microwave too What about then where do they fall on the spectrum what makes you think they re not dangerous Or that they are Because they are longer than light waves They ve got longer wavelengths Which what does that mean They have lower frequencies They don t carry as much energy with them Lower frequencies Let me consult my chart Okay good idea Or can anyone help her What was your question Claire Oh I didn t have a question Oh okay What was the question Why is she looking at her chart Nope same We think they re not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light Light is Okay good so I think this is a good segue to the next question which is why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans while others aren t Do you know what a segue is Okay Which ones have more energy than others Gamma rays and X rays and UVH rays Okay good Peter did you have something you wanted to add To what he just said Mm hmm Okay good and can you repeat that Sam Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy Okay good So ultimately what is that energy doing Why is that harmful to us Can stimulate cell growth The more energy it has the more like materials it can penetrate Like visible light wouldn t really cut through you but gamma rays could like travel through skin And X rays can What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology Cancer Well that it s when cells grow too fast the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and There s a mistake in the coding of the DNA and then everything just goes haywire and the cells like what Caleb said grow at abnormally fast rates and they just take over that area and spread Well yeah they stop functioning as normal cells and their sole function is to reproduce and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells Okay so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy This dangerous energy Well wouldn t like Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and or is that not Why do they stimulate growth Because they have energy What does the energy do to stimulate it What were you going to say Ronnie Well I just said that they trigger they don t like stimulate I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary But they can trigger something dangerous like with I don t really have like the percent or anything but What else might control cell growth DNA Okay good yeah Lots of energy can Can energy alter DNA I feel like it can t Well isn t that what it s doing if it s triggering abnormal cell growth I don t know Is anyone in here have you taken or are you taking biology I took it last year I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer It s okay and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion that it does lie in the DNA and that you know certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle So when we think about cancer a lot of times in light or electromagnetic waves a lot of times we think about skin cancer And we talked a bit about that yesterday We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world So how does skin color variation how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives You mean based on their race Just based on their geologic background Geographic background not geologic Well I mean people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really really pale skin I don t think that s true I think it s just that it doesn t show up as much like you can definitely still get sun damage No of course you can still get sunburned but I don t think it s like It s harder I think so I think it s just less noticeable Yeah I think it s just less noticeable I really don t think it has anything to do with Okay so you re getting the same amount good you re getting the same amount of radiation sure Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb our skin absorbs It s actually it s in their Grace and Lana s video About how What did we do On your presentation about sunburn How sunburn works I don t remember Okay so ultimately I guess I ll restate the question So how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive We see a lot of variation so a lot of people often times say Oh why do people in in countries that are near the equator Why are they darker wouldn t that make them hotter Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light Is that true is that what s happening It seems kind of Wouldn t that make you sweat more then Which would be good if it was hot I guess sweat Sweat is just to release the heat on your body No but that s what I m saying like if you get hotter quicker then you would start sweating earlier which cools you down What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations Melanin Okay good alright So people who have darker skin do they have more or less They have more It s in eyes too right It s what causes eye color differences Maybe I m making that up but What do you think the purpose of the melanin is Is it to absorb Grace offered one theory what s another theory too there There are several different reasons What does it do to UV light What s different about people that live say in the equator regions like the and people who live up north They don t get sunburned if they live there I mean There s like nothing to Yeah exactly People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned because they re not exposed to that much sun or their relatives weren t And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin But I don t know why Do you know Miss Roseborough Yeah I have an understanding yes And when I think about it I kind of think about the actual pigment itself and what it s doing and where it s located on the body What it may be serving to do Doesn t it synthesize vitamin D for us That would make sense Yeah that s vitamin D from sunlight I guess that s why Okay so people who have more melanin have live in the sun you know they have more exposure to the sun Why do they need that extra melanin To protect them Okay yeah so let s go with that to protect them From what From the radiation like I guess if you re out in the sun more you need more protection so like it s kind of like a built in sunblock What would it protect So it s on the surface right Protects the inner skin It protects the outer layer right Epidermis Yeah I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking Is that why they you have lighter on your hands Oh I think that s the thing about like gamma rays for example being more like that was one of the question because they have more ability to penetrate through skin and Okay so really what s happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin How does it do that It just doesn t the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat and so You get the heat but not the radiation Right exactly so it doesn t go further into your body So darker people get less sunburned than fairer people because of that Well does it necessarily have to do with sunburn And they re less likely to get skin cancer Yeah I d say they re less likely to get skin cancer When you get tan are you getting more melanin in your skin Yeah what s happening when you get tan So shouldn t tanning make your skin stronger Well If it increases melanin I don t think it s necessarily increasing it Because the tan goes away Oh So it s like you have whatever your natural skin color is then that is determined how much Okay Okay so next misconception that a lot of people have or just something that I ve always wondered about I don t know if it s a misconception or not but I m thinking about colors that we associate with certain just everyday things So when I go into the bathroom when I go into the kitchen I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water and blue for cold water Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true Because fire is red Water and ice is blue It s not really blue it s more clear White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames Yeah explain that I don t know I guess back a long time ago before they knew that The hottest part of the fire is at the top and if you think about a flame usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom and then it s the red orange at the top Which is where it would be the hottest It s hottest at the top But there s at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from At the peak it s the hottest But then the bunsen burner the hottest part is like Yeah the hottest part of the flame is the top You get a marshmallow you put it at the bottom No sir What color is at the top guys Red White Or orange Blue and white at the bottom It s an experiment Miss Rose let s do experiments on fire That s a good idea I think we should at this point Do you have bunsen burners in here No I don t have a gas source So let s just go back I even broke it down and I was thinking about well where did this come from I was thinking what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red and what are being reflected by the color red And so is the color red actually hotter How could I relate that to temperature How do you even relate a color to temperature So just the color red what s it reflecting What s it absorbing What color does it reflect It reflects red And it absorbs green and blue Or cyan Right so going back to the what makes it that color its natural frequency what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature What s happening as a result of different white light say striking it and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light Would red or blue actually be hotter As a pigment Blue should be hotter because it has more energy it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency Yeah Sam s right So with a pigment Think about a pigment first What about it just think about it Yeah so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed and certain wavelengths of light are being reflected What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light What happens to the energy that is being absorbed It transfers to the medium Okay good I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths so Probably right Okay good so it absorbs so let s think about blue again How could you apply that What wavelengths of light does it absorb Shorter wavelengths than red Well no blue absorbs red and green so this would be longer wavelengths and lower frequencies So red would absorb the blue Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency had more energy which means it would be hotter right What do you guys think Can you restate that Sorry because red absorbs blue and blue has a higher frequency the red would be absorbing the higher frequency which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency So red would be the hottest The man has a point I agree with Peter I agree with it too I agree with Peter Yeah that s sort of the conclusion I came to the only conclusion Then I started thinking more I was like well how does this apply to stars So if I see a star that gives off a 
 Okay so for our first trial we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding HCL and it took 73 5 milliliters And for our second trial we had the same amount of milk of magnesia but this time we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water And it took less HCL hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did And the first time we only added five drops of phenylthalene and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different and the ten drops definitely made it pinker but we don t think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator and not part of the reaction You guys actually brought up a good point How many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities How many think that you didn t add enough Let s just ask that Or how would you know if you added too much or not enough Alright go ahead Will Well as long as it turns pink you know that the indicator s working What if it s pinker It wouldn t matter because it turns clear towards the end What do other people think Alright Vivian I feel like if there s not enough indicator that when you add more and more HCL to the solution it becomes the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink So I don t think there s such a thing as adding too much indicator Our group added about five drops and that was enough Okay what Tad Actually adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants So in an extreme case if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator that would definitely distort the concentration True what do people think about that Alright Jimmy The indicator doesn t participate in the overall reaction so it doesn t really make a difference What do people have to say to that Alright why don t you take Discuss would adding too much indicator would that affect your concentration Like in terms of volume maybe you re adding to more volume of your reaction would that affect the concentrations of your reactants Okay thoughts Alright Jerry I feel like if you added the indicator it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water if you added let s say would change the concentration Okay alright Stephanie I think it would like because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia even if you add a lot of phenylthalene it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that s what s reacting So I don t think it affects it Alright Mackenzie Isn t pH determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions So if it s it would be moles over liters so if there were more liters it would be a smaller concentration right Alright Corey It s mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine they will neutralize It doesn t really matter the over liters as long as the moles are equal Okay Rick Well since phenylthalene is an indicator it doesn t actually participate in the reaction just like water so adding it would just increase the volume which as he said which would dilute the solution Adding a lot would have a profound affect but adding a little bit wouldn t actually make a difference Okay Richard It would because there s a lower concentration it would take a lot longer for it to react meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error Because when you re using a burette it s continuously dripping so then if you re swirling and it doesn t react as fast then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it So those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with and all reasonable It does affect the concentration and when you add a few drops just like Vivian said if you don t add enough then it s still indicating but in terms of the overall concentration the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small and so that s why you see like a very faint pink but it s still indicating Now if you add more drops of course you re going to have a darker pink but the overall reaction volume would increase and so if you add drops of phenylthalene if you re adding like five drops compared to your overall reaction volume it wouldn t be that big of a difference So you would still have some source of error but since you re only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected You know it would make it so it s more diluted Okay does that make sense to everyone Alright those were all good comments Anyone else have a comment Alright so let s go to table two In last week s experiment we were testing how much HCL it would take to neutralize 25 mL of milk of magnesia First we measured 25 mL of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask Then we slowly used the burette to drop the HCL into the flask and it took us 55 5 mL of HCL to clear the solution Every time we d see that it s clear it took the solution longer time So the first time we stopped putting we stopped adding HCL but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink But then after the third or fourth stop that we made it took longer than one second so by the time it took so like towards the end it didn t turn pink anymore So for the second trial what we did instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia we just used 15 milliliters and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there s a change in the amount of HCL we used and it did because it took a lot less which was 35 5 milliliters of HCL as compared to the first trial where we used 55 5 So we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one It was roughly 35 5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m o m to come clear as over HCL and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn t expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once Do you think you did something wrong Well we kind of did but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear Did anyone else did any other groups think that when the reaction was happening that you had done something wrong Or were surprised by the results Alright Ian Oh no just saying yes Okay anyone have a comment We thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of HCL for the indicator to start working What do you mean start working To start turning opaque because it was pink for a long time We had to add extra HCL to the burette We actually thought that it wouldn t stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times stopped the burette from running and every time it kept changing color So we thought that happened throughout the experiment Did you think it was going to go on forever Yep Okay any other groups Alright Andrew We noticed that yeah what they said It changed to clear and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink We thought it was the reversible reaction rates but then like we were surprised at how big a difference it was because it was really clear when we were stirring it but once we stopped became really pink Okay alright Will There was also a transitional phase where it turned light and we thought that was the phase it would turn into rather than clear so we actually stopped it there but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear so we started adding more Okay alright group three First we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene It took about 7 milliliters of one molar HCL to actually fully huh Yeah it took 70 milliliters and then it stayed clear from there For the second trial we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia would it would the time decrease I mean the time to neutralize decrease And so we add 15 mL of magnesia and the same amount of H2O and so we used up about So I heard something about timing because I heard the first couple groups timed some of the things What did you guys time and why did you choose to time that Here let s start here because you guys timed something What did you time and why did you choose to time that Well basically I think we re just measuring the amount of HCL we used up and see how many times we need to stop the burette for Well we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more HCL we put the faster it was from the switch so we kept adding HCL and it turned all clear It turned all clear the faster The previous times were milky white and then towards the end it becomes clear Like totally clear Okay did anyone observe something different in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink Okay table six As we added more HCL the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink Okay so yeah Rick I don t think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added rather than the time you left it in there So if you add more of course it s going to change quicker but it doesn t matter like how long you have to wait for So you guys were saying that when you added the HCL that it changed quicker to white and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink Okay Gabriel We timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore it will take a long time to get back to the reactions right back to the products which turns it to pink Okay alright Corey I was saying that it was faster turning back to pink The reaction was actually it was slower going back to pink That s okay Okay let s go to table four In our experiment in our procedure actually we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide and one beaker we would heat instead of diluting it we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees Celsius and we would perform the experiment with adding HCL using the burette and in the other beaker we would leave it in room temperature which is around 25 degrees Celsius and we would do the same procedure adding the HCL with the burette Our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction What we found was that when we heated it it actually changing from pink to clear it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature so we don t know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it ll react faster We also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did so that may have skewed our answers a little as well It took us a lot longer and more HCL to turn the solution clear again Comments Does anyone think that so this group didn t dilute How many groups diluted and added distilled water Okay so all the other groups did Do you think that their data would be affected because they didn t dilute and because you did What are your thoughts Alright Nina We diluted our second trial and it didn t affect the amount of HCL needed Why do you think well from your observations that s obvious but does anyone know why Or think why that might happen Why would your data not be affected Or think that maybe theirs was a fluke And your data should have been affected by diluting it with water Alright Joey Is it because the HCL only reacts with the milk of magnesia So it doesn t affect how much water because it doesn t react with water Okay what do you guys think Alright Katie I think it will affect it because the concentration s higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there s less surface area I would say Okay less surface area Okay that s a possibility Alright Gabriel I think it wouldn t affect the amount of HCL that would be added but it will just affect the time because with water it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there s more volume and without diluting it their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink and then at the end it will just turn clear either way Why do you think it would be faster if they didn t dilute it Because there would be less volume and the smaller the spaces the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around Okay reasonable yep So our group kind of did both We had a control we redid the same experiment for number one and then we measured how many milliliters of HCL it took so if you change the concentration it does affect the amount of HCL it takes to neutralize it Alright Michael We diluted it and it took longer for us to we added more HCL for it to neutralize and I feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia there would be less molarity and if it s not diluted it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted It would become weaker You can t change the strength of an acid or a base because it s based on what it s by definition You can t make a strong base weak but that s okay Wintel In our case we did two solutions different concentration The amount of HCL that s needed to neutralize the solution shouldn t be should be the same but in this case the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more HCL because during the delay the reaction the HCL hasn t still reacted with milk of magnesia yet and because of that delay there s more HCL that s needed to compensate for that Okay so there s a little bit of stoichiometry going on where the number of moles or the amount the amount s still the same regardless of whether of milk of magnesia regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn t So the amount s still the same 
 Tyler pushed the ball Okay well how does that how does that affect the ball It makes it go faster And make it fall So why is that a problem Because she ran because she because she pushed it I know but why is it a problem that she pushed it Because it goes faster And that s a problem because Because why She didn t win Oh what do you mean win She win the game Oh did you all make a game out of it Uh uh we didn t turn a game into it Okay well what are you doing then He s playing a game what are you doing Kylie He s rolling and see not playing a game Just rolling and seeing where they go Wait a minute what Rolling them to see what How many sticks it takes So did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one Taking turns Oh okay So do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them Not push them So is that what you re saying it wouldn t be fair if she pushes hers but no one else pushes theirs Because pushing makes it go faster you said Okay Alright so it makes it what Makes it go farther okay Alright so do you wanna do you want was anybody else pushing theirs Rebekah Okay do you want Rebekah and Kylie to do theirs over again Alright show them how you and Todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same Now I guess I m gonna have to get our ball I need ball number two We need a Captain Miss Henderson can I be the Captain We don t need a Captain You re all doing what you re being what We re not being Captain s we re being what Scientists Scientists So work together Wait don t pick up her ball She hasn t measured it yet Five six seven eight nine 10 11 21 sticks Where is 21 You looking for it on the hundreds chart Are you looking for it on the calendar You can get up and point to it I got 18 sticks for my ball I can t find it anywhere 18 sticks I m going to see how many sticks I got for my ball Okay how would you find 21 on the chart I don t know Where could you start By one Okay 20 Oh you found it Do you need more sticks honey 17 yes Okay go ask another group can you borrow some sticks Another ball 12 So it takes half of 14 Because she said No I m using it And she and I said I have a idea and she said no What was your idea John I was just trying do it on my head like on my back of my head then down Use your head as a ramp Uh huh And where did you have the ball hun In her pocket the whole time Why Em Does the ball belong to you or to the group Group So if you re not using it should you let someone else in the group use it Okay go ahead Roll it on my back And now roll it If it does it Right here No I mean like right here Where do you want them to where do you want them to start the ball I think is what they re asking In my head somewhere like right here Because a ramp starts where On the top Up high And goes down So if you re using his head I would lay like this Oh Did that work Yeah What do we do with it after we do our balls Okay you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we re gonna clean up in just a second Put your name at the top of your paper please We used it on this one You re supposed to do all four of the balls Ball number one ball number two ball number three ball number four We would do ball number three Number one is this one How about number one But this one Which number is that one So get number three we ll have a race and we ll So what are you all doing with the ramp now We re putting it on the chair And whoever gets it whoever gets down to the bottom first We were actually gonna roll off it Well why won t it roll off that ramp Because why What stops it The block The block stops it okay So How much does it go Try the little one Whoever is in front of me move I got 10 Miss Henderson everybody is taking our balls Okay guys I would like for you to clean up your things please I saw some great science learning science work put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug Put your paper at your seat Quickly Let s see how quickly we can clean up Id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you ve learned John you have to put everything back in your basket buddy All the sticks and balls please And then you may put your basket on the art table Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Okay let s come to the rug and let s share some things that you learned today Move that way please I said put your paper at your seat for now Miss Henderson Braxton said this isn t whistling Okay well we re not gonna debate whistling right now Okay thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug Okay I would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today Tell us something you did something you figured out Bryson If you push the ball it goes farther If you don t push the ball it goes not farther Okay alright Who else learned something else through their science work John That when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes And then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn t get to the stick then it gets farther and and we tried whoever gets to the stick It goes it s the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest Okay the green okay Todd what s something you learned today through your science work If you push it it ll go farther and that s it Okay alright anything else we haven t mentioned Eli There s a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it it will go past it If you make a ball if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop So the block stopped it sometimes Yes Sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it Yeah But sometimes it stopped it Okay Grayson Well sometimes what I did was I kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then I was rolling this big ball and once it hit it it kinda like jumped up in the air and went Harleigh And moved in And for like three blocks for three sticks Okay Preston what did you learn today If you like if your hand go fast the ball goes fast If your hand goes slow the ball goes slow If your hand goes fast what do you mean by if your hand goes fast Like if you re at the bottom and and you do that And go like that it goes fast What is that called that you re doing Pushing the thing So if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow it goes slow The force Interesting The force of pushing okay Chloe I learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes When you lay what diagonal What is it called again What A diagonal line When you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster What is she talking about Eli the what She s talking about a ramp Oh the ramp when you lay the ramp diagonal Uh huh The ball goes fast When you lay it straight it doesn t go fast it just sits there Oh so if it s if it s less If it s a lower ramp it goes less If it s a higher diagonal ramp you re talking about then it goes farther Interesting Brody We tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that So you made you made ramps with your bodies So did it go 
 Anybody tell me how much cases usually run At Radio Shack they re 30 dollars Okay you know what So we ll factor that in in a minute But Alex you had your hand raised So I d like to hear from you I was just gonna say that the 199 tax is gonna come in anyway so What if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping Okay hold up Cynthia But even though Even though if you use 12 you re only gonna have a couple dollars left over With the economy these days things are not cheap So you can t buy something with five dollars You re not gonna get a case for that cheap That s probably right I m gonna hear two more of you and then I have something I wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about and I think is really important to point out So I wanna hear what you two have to say and then I m gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned Go ahead It s better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to then you d still have zero dollars left but it s better to have equal or more money Okay that s you know I think you re right That seems like it just makes sense right And one more yeah Actually when I bought my phone I got a case just for about five dollars on ebay Ebay so you got a used one And it paid for shipping so I didn t yes I did Okay well you know what I wanna talk about that because that s actually what you guys just said is really important and several of you others mentioned it Maybe we don t want maybe I don t want to have the exactly the price maybe I want to have at least And if I say I wanna have at least 200 dollars is there a way to say at least with math symbols To make that equation change so it says least Cause right now it says equal Is there a way to do it so it says at least Colin If you you need to get the iPhone and the case in the same shipping order or else it s gonna cost more for shipping Oh okay So yeah I need at least a certain amount Yeah So you re gonna Wanna jump in on that guys You need to put the greater than or equal to sign But what does that look like The greater than sign with a line under it Okay And what s the word in English that we have for that symbol Yeah say it again Alexis That least It is So now how much do I need to save to get at least 200 dollars right So it s okay if I have exactly or more than So that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about Maybe I need more money if she wants more more than just a phone I m sure she does right With the What about the just come with the phone Just that or does it come with something else Like a Charger battery or even a case itself So again you re saying I need at least 200 dollars right Depending on what comes with the phone like a Christmas special Like half off or something What you can Also think is where you gonna buy it And where is there s no tax and stuff So it depends on where you re gonna buy it If you want no tax that means like on Ebay or something but It might be 50 percent off and stuff like that Okay interesting I m just saying it depends where you re gonna buy your phone Okay no I like that a lot When I was doing my equation I got 121 So you would still have a dollar left over And you know how Cassidy said that she can get it on Ebay that much Most people they I understand that it s cheap and most people want it like that but I bought stuff off the line before and some of the stuff does work good and some of em you drop them and it breaks So it s not always good Somethin to pay attention to All right I m gonna change the conversation a little bit because I think you guys are doing really really well Let s go with what you guys said and say I need at least 200 dollars If that s true is there any way to find out or to answer the original question which Nick brought up How much money do I need to save each day based on what we have so far Where do I go from here There is a way to solve it You grab 200 dollars and then you subtract 80 from it Okay I m gonna stop you right there I don t mean to interrupt Katherine you re watching this and I saw your paper what do you think about what Najeem just said Like Okay and why is that I don t know That s how you solve it in equality Okay so can you repeat what you said You subtract 80 from both sides Okay I m gonna go ahead and do that right now And what does that leave us with 120 And you know what I have a question What does that 120 represent I mean if 200 is how much the phone costs what s 120 about I m not sure How much you need to raise until then Okay okay And Nayanna Can you comment on what you think might be the next step Divide 12 from 120 Again Divide 12 from 120 Okay And somebody else jump in The answer was The answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10 Okay and Katie you were ready to say something What would you say I was about to say Equals 10 X equals 10 and X equals at least 10 Oh it was so you re not liking what I wrote over here Alexis At least cause you have to keep the all the way down Okay Katherine what do you think I agree with Alexis because it can t just like change because When you say it can t change what do you mean the side Oh Okay that s good I didn t know what it was I m just asking And then you have to put what X means Oh Oh Oh so what is the label What are the units we re talkin about Ah the blue tooth If you wanna have a little extra money you could have more and plus if you get a little extra money one day but you have the same another and you get a little less the next day you could raise up for another day Oh like if I m going to collect cans and I don t collect as many cans one day but I collect extra the next day Yeah like that Nayanna you had your hand raised When you have to add 40 to 200 for the Bluetooth Ah that s an interesting idea So maybe we so tell me what to write Instead of this how would you change this to incorporate what you just said 80 plus X equals 240 Okay are you pleased are you okay with that I disagree Cynthia I disagree with your answer on that one I don t agree that it s 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money you would You should You should do 11 for a day because if you do you ll get 132 and then you ll have extra money Okay But that s the problem What do you mean when you say it s not asking Well it s not asking for extra money or anything it s just asking how many How much money you need per day Anthony I noticed you ve got some stuff written down What do you think about I wanna go back to what Nayanna said She says she s gonna change the equation here and she put 240 up there why Why did she do that and do you agree with that Yeah cause then you would have a little extra money left A little bit You would have a little bit of extra money left Okay like the Bluetooth in the case maybe Okay Isn t this another problem Another problem not a part of this one yet Yeah cause they re not asking how much extra money do you need This problem this question s not asking how much extra do you need for a Bluetooth also Okay How much are the phone and Bluetooth it s just asking for the phone Okay I think because The question wasn t asking to bring extra money into it We just brought the extra money to round the make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay but we shouldn t change the equation Cause it s not asking you to Okay This question isn t saying anything about case or a Bluetooth yet it s a yes question And this question talks about Bluetooth Okay so what I kinda like is you guys were doin this problem and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem which is no problem at all Let s jump ahead just for a minute and assume that I did want to get the Bluetooth Would this be the equation to represent And before I answer this question what I would like to do I m gonna call on Olivia and then I m gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co pilots and the pilots come up but not yet Let s hear what Olivia has to say Would it be equals 12 X if you wanted to get it before Christmas Or would it be after One more time I could barely hear ya Would we still get that before Christmas or would it be after Before before So would it be 12 Comments on that I agree with that Thumbs up if you think 12 thumbs down if you think no we don t need 12 on this one Okay Adrian you have something We need to know how much money you earned each day Well that s What do you guys think about that question Well that s what we re finding out right now I know but how much you earn That s how much he has to save Pilots switch with somebody in the back All right here we go So now I have a question for you Can everybody turn around for just a minute please Thank you Question for you If I wanted to graph our first solution on a number line what might that graph look like So will you guys agree that okay we need to earn a minimum amount And at least 10 dollars a day but if I wanted to graph that put that on a number line represent that graphically what would that look like It would be like a It would be But the circle What kind of circle I didn t hear you Shaded So you want to put this up here Yeah Amarra I d like to hear your opinion on that I don t I never understood the shaded thing I don t know why it s shaded It s shaded because it s not I think if it s not shaded it means greater than I mean greater or less than But when it s shaded I think It means equal to or less than or With Okay Tara do you wanna contribute to that Well whenever it says greater than or equal to the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to or greater than which is over 10 But greater than or less than can t be that number so it has to be open circle And than greater than or equal to Anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle unshaded circle In real life what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle Go ahead Al Fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils A little louder I got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils So in that problem could 14 students have mechanical pencils if you have fewer than 14 No So that would be unshaded Cause 14 doesn t count So in this question Amarra the least number of money I should save per day is how much I think 10 is a good answer because it does go into the number And so would be shaded or unshaded Shaded Oh is that the only number amount of money I should save each day Is that it Are their other possibilities out Yeah you could do
