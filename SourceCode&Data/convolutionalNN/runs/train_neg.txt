 Emotions Is emotions that s so right Kippa were you going to say something else In this picture he uses lots of texture to create like when he s doing the sunflowers he uses texture to show the light going on Right and how did he show that texture did he how did he apply his paint Sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast Sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick Vincent would that you could almost feel it feel the texture And emotion like Ozea said Emotion was huge for Vincent If he was happy he painted bright If he was sad he painted sort of dark How about our man Pablo Picasso What movement Logan is he Do you know the move Cubism Cubism And why do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism Anybody besides Mr Logan anybody else know But thanks Logan for raising What are you thinking what Using geometric shapes to make things Using geometric shapes that s right He was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see and flattening the shapes and flattening his color Where Van Gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two Picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self portrait I wanna put up the work Let s start with our man Vincent again Let s take a look at See where my hand Oooh You can see all the wrinkles in my hand No way Isn t that cool Okay Sorry don t mean to keep fooling around So let s talk about this Let s talk about these two paintings guys What do you guys and let s see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something What do you see do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here Anybody somebody besides Kippa Carina That it kinda has to deal with his emotion like where the boats are I feel like what I m feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff And then at the sunflowers he s really happy and bright and That was good Carina Okay Elijah did you wanna Was that about what you were gonna say You were gonna talk about the sadness What colors like do you think that if Go ahead Elijah He could ve been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark light red and all these other bright colors Right and I remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer that s why I looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions wasn t that what you were saying Yeah he was feeling both happy and sad cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too Right that s good Okay Jose what did you wanna say He s sort of like there too but the boats might be out to sea Like one s out to sea but one s not but torn I don t know how many are already but Three are out in I don t know how many are out There s four that are here and then there look like four that are out I think that s the other Okay but what were you going to say Oh you re right three Well what were you gonna say about them I m guessing three two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad But they could only take three because there s only enough for There s enough room for only three boats or three people But they only wanted their own boat two or three of them were but three didn t go because they didn t know what to do or anything but the other three did Interesting that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw Kind of Yeah I like that I like that Trevor what re you gonna say It s kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers they re mostly up but looks like they re starting to droop They re starting to die That is good I like that He might be like Oh I m happy for a while but I m starting to feel back down Nice Did you wanna say something I would like to say one has different types of One looks more real Those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the Than the bottom more realistic than this picture He really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers I think Does anybody know what were you gonna say Elijah You can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there s bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it s orange and then at the very bottom it s dark green Like right there Yes that is very true That is very good The storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting Wow Kyle Happiness is never lasting and what was the last one I m moved by that opinion Go ahead and what was the So in the flowers the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die Because happiness can be fleeting And we know Oh does anybody know what was the political was there any political things going on The political mood or the setting Where was Vincent from did you guys find that in your research He stayed in France is that where he studied Is that what you guys are telling me Yeah That was sorta the hub of his movement we ll say Any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that s up You can look on your research papers to see Or anything Go ahead Emily I think that the actual emotions of these paintings don t really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in France So really I don t think they were much of a Really affected him What were you Going along with Emily maybe he was just so dull that or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them Because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending So it depends maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then Because he didn t have the happiest of all lives so He didn t We ve even talked about that Do you guys remember when we talked about how Vincent Van Gogh suffered a little bit mentally He was a little Crazy Crazy and in and out of mental institutions Yeah so maybe something good happened Cause his life was not very happy So most of his pictures are No not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull But you can tell when he s going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in Like the boats you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad And then if you look at the sunflowers they re all bright and dreamy I mean yes this is a few dark bits but I think that s probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life Guys this is really great I love all your comments Logan I m gonna take one more and then I m gonna tell you something What go ahead Logan I thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened Like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something And then he started painting it sad I have a question I think that You ve got something really important hon Yeah so he never really stopped a painting in the middle When he started he finished He never stopped Because if the light changed it would totally change the picture That s so true That is very true And you guys know that Jose is it okay if I speak real quick and then we ll go back because we wanna talk about Picasso too for a minute You guys know that Vincent used to live with a painter This is my fun fact Not really fun I guess But a fact about Vincent He lived with a painter Paul Gauguin This was when he was in and out of mental institutions And they had a fight and he became so upset you guys know he cut off his ear And I showed you that one picture of him is a self portrait of him with his ear cut off You guys remember that And the other important thing I wanted to tell you was that he didn t sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after After he died they sold one of his paintings for 8 000 000 000 Remember that It was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time Okay now let s talk about And Van Gogh people if you guys wanna talk about Picasso you can but let s give the Picasso teams some time here This is And I m sorry the lighting is not the best But who knows what the name of this painting is Marie Is it Three Musicians Three Musicians And it was done by who Pablo Pablo Picasso Does anybody know where Pablo Picasso was from Let s see someone other than Mr Logan Travis Barcelona Barcelona Where s Barcelona you guys Spain Spain I got my Barcelona jersey Alright and who knows Rudy do you happen to know And he s like Uh oh I m on the spot Ooo Do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in Pablo Picasso In Cubism Cubism that s correct And we did go over what were the characteristics of cubism real fast Anybody Mr Logan Geometric shapes Geometric shapes and what else They were flat What was flat His pictures But what element His painting the colors The colors were flat Thank you Okay let s have some opinion about what you see up here The Three Musicians does anybody have Randy do you have any how do you feel about it honey What do you think about it I don t know It doesn t seem like it s in a down mood cause music is usually a happy sort of thing So it seems like a happy kinda picture Kind of a happy fun picture Pablo he wasn t so concerned about emotions when he painted He maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time Does anybody know what was happening in Spain at the time What are you thinking Civil war There was a civil war So maybe he was a little bit affected by that He also traveled Does anybody know where he traveled to Rudy To go and study the art forms of Paris He went to Paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff So he went to study there and then where else He went to Africa He went to Africa and he really became obsessed with African masks And so he did start using that as an influence in his painting Carina what were you gonna say darling Oh I was thinking it s kind of like a mix of emotions cause it has so many colors There s bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper there s a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention It s attention grabbing isn t it Cause of all the contrasting I think more in his is the contrasting colors You can see the blue and orange right next to each other Those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright they totally stand off each other Right the blue and the orange I can t remember what Oh they re complementary colors I couldn t remember what that was Right so that s why And I think his color contrast says a lot His flat colors and they re bright and he puts them right next to each other What do you think about this picture Robert Do you like it Yeah Do you know why you might like it or you don t like it I like the picture like yeah Well you and Maria are talking about doing remember you were talking about making your own picture You wanna tell us about that what you guys wanna do For your own picture And you re doing the style of Pablo aren t you Yeah So what do you think you guys are gonna do Have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the Three Musicians on a porch You wanna have the Three Musicians be in a picture with you and your brother And Maria are you gonna Not on a porch On a deck That s what I was gonna say And you guys are gonna are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes The picture Yeah Try to Good good Do you guys have anybody Oh what were you gonna say Elijah It makes me think about it because there s so many twists and turns and curves and things Kinda like if you look hard enough you can see em but when you just look at it you re like Whoa Right when you first look at it you re like Whoa what is that Are those people Are those shapes There s lots of curves and turns At first it s a little confusing At first it is a little confusing isn t it When you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for em you can actually see what it is Right if we didn t tell you it was the Three Musicians you might not know at first You can kinda tell because of that one right there That thing yeah The instrument here And the guitar And then the paper with the two The sheet music The sheet music you could kinda tell it was about the musicians What were you gonna say When you first look at the painting your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue s clarinet Whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying At first when you just but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form It does start to form What were you gonna say Emily I think that in my 
 Well you know what especially after Mrs Bennett taught you the three things she wanted you to do in reading by having you look around the room and skip around the room and flip on the carpet we thought Oh boy that Nathan really needs to do something hands on And I know from you being in Reading Recovery that when you heard a book twice you practically knew it I mean you knew the story You could go somewhere and tell it right Yep When you read the book is it easy for you to retell it What is it like to retell a story that you just read Not so easy for me cause I had to pick up a book look at it for a minute and then I pop it and then I know it Okay if I read a story to you would you be able to go tell it to someone else Yes Okay But right next to me Okay Okay All right well these are the things we re gonna practice And because we don t want to leave out the visual style of learning because it s also an important way to get information we re gonna focus on the auditory and the kinestetic the hearing and the hands on type learning and we re also gonna include some visual so that it will strengthen that part for you But we wanna make sure we re getting you where your strength is Because you are fantastic at listening and doing hands on activities Oh you have a plan in your mind about what kind of castle you re gonna build It s not a castle It s gonna be like when I see that in movies Like a tower like where the Egypt Egyptites The Egyptians Yeah Like a pyramid Yeah Okay cool All right Would you like some extra things like maybe some games or some extra things you can do to help you remember in class Yeah because my teacher she gives us free games like learning games in our math book There s math games and you have to put your thing on it and you have to guess who much it is And if you get it right you stay on there Okay cool Well I want to add some games like that that you re gonna And we re gonna add some things that you can do to help you remember directions in class and remember what Miss Smithson has asked you to do Cause one of the things that I ve noticed is that when Miss Smithson gives you two or three directions you ll start one and then you forget what the other ones are And you re like Ugh what do I do now Yeah because my brain it has so much stuff and because if I get more it kind of breaks the other stuff And you know I wasn t gonna talk about this yet but by you saying that your brain has so much stuff I wanted to remind you about do you know what good listening looks like Uh huh What do good listeners look like Their hands are crisscrossed with their hands in their lap and wherever the teacher goes they keep their eyes on em Okay and then if you have a comment if I say Would anyone like to ask a question or make a comment about what we re learning Let s say I just taught you about Clemson Football Or I like hockey That s my favorite Okay let s say we were learning about hockey The equipment used in hockey okay So if I asked you to either ask me a question or make a comment about what we re learning would you tell me the names of some of the hockey equipment that you know of Or would you ask me a question about a piece of hockey equipment that you ve seen but you don t know what it s called Or would you tell me a story about how you really like hockey Hmmm how I really like hockey I knew you d say that You always do that You remember one of things that Miss McGinnis taught you in Reading Recovery And one of the strengths this is what I love about you one of the things that a lot of people have trouble with when they re reading is that they can t relate what they re reading to themselves or to their lives You are absolutely fantastic with that Fantastic If there s a story of a dog and I have a dog and my dog did the same thing Right So since you re so good at that though sometimes I think that that is one of the things that gets your mind off on on Hey my dog did that Instead of on exactly what your teacher s wanting you to do So one of the things about being a really good listener is to remember what comments and what statements and what questions are necessary for what you re learning And which comments and questions should wait for later even though they re zinging around in your head okay So if I m doing a whole class lesson about different colored fur on dogs and I say Can anyone think of a color that a dog s fur might be What would be a comment you could make Black and brown cause that s what my dog is made out of Okay black and brown All right let s say somebody says blonde somebody else says white and then somebody raises their hand and they say Well I don t know what all colors dogs can be but my dog Sandy is really pretty Is that a comment that is necessary for what we re talking about No Okay so that s one of the things that you can practice And I love your stories and I know Miss Smithson does too And you have a lot of kids and grownups in this school that feel really close to you and we feel like we have a good relationship with you because you do share things about yourself Yeah but I only do that at the beginning of the day the end of the day and at writing Cause I write down the things in writing Good well then I m glad Miss Smithson is also working on this with you because as much as I want to know about you I don t want it to distract you from what it is you re supposed to be thinking about Okay Okay Three more blocks Okay let s talk about some of the things that we re gonna put in place for you okay A couple of em I m pretty excited about okay We re gonna work on your memory with reading and in general with classwork so that when someone tells Nathan what to do Nathan s gonna be able to remember it Instead of getting distracted and thinking Huh I have no idea what I m supposed to do next Yeah because in my class there s some kids Zachary and Brody and the two new kids they re talking in the back And that s can be very distracting can t it Okay do you know how to focus Do you know how to tune people out What do you do when you re distracted in the classroom I just turn around and go like this Okay do you think you know how to tune people out without having to tell them to stop What if you knew they were gonna talk no matter what but you still needed to listen Could you I could do this to block their sound Okay you could That kinda reminds me of the bat we were talking about for some reason It s kinda like you re directing your hearing at one place And sometimes I push it to what I m hearing at So then when I do that in my mouth I can hear it more good without noises from the construction site that s near our house I can focus on it Okay I think that s fantastic what you ve just said You make a conscious effort to focus on what you re trying to hear That what I want you to do when you notice that other people are talking behind you Instead of worrying about what they re doing I want you to focus on what you need to be hearing I want you to stop and think I m not gonna listen to them I m gonna listen to Miss Smithson Okay And see if that helps Just like you strain to hear the construction noises okay All right we re gonna do some fun things with you that I think you re gonna like First of all I know you love video games So one of the things that we ve tried before that doesn t seem to be working very well is Odyssey And I know that when you get on Odyssey you like to choose the math games over the reading games Probably just Why do you choose math over reading Cause I wanna get more math so then I can just focus on reading cause if I m really smart at math I can just drop it so I know everything I know sweetheart It s a lot more fun to do something that you re really good at So we re gonna change up your computer program Instead of having you work on Odyssey during the day instead of Odyssey you re gonna work on a new program called Earobics And it s supposed to be super helpful with your reading skills And Mrs Price the speech teacher whose office is across the hall she said it is really fun and that she knew kids at Griggs Road that did it and they loved it okay So we re gonna try Earobics So we re gonna keep a computer game for you but we re gonna try one that hopefully is gonna work better to help your reading skills come up instead of Odyssey Okay All right The next thing we re gonna do is we re gonna give you a little tape recorder Have you ever had a tape recorder No and I haven t even seen one I know a lot of people don t use tape recorders anymore Most people can record things on their phone and all kinds of gadgets Well I had when I was little I had this little thing and it had a recorder When I would sing a song into the microphone I could record it and then play it to my friends Okay well we re gonna do something like that We re gonna have you if Mrs Smithson is giving directions and then you guys are getting ready to do an assignment or group work or whatever it is she wants you to do she s gonna come over and she s gonna give the directions to you You get to press record on your tape recorder and say the directions yourself into the tape recorder Then you get to stop it and play it back and hear yourself saying the directions Okay Unless you need them we re gonna have you put the little tape recorder away so that it doesn t bother you Like maybe in a pocket behind your seat or something And then only if you get stuck and you think Hmm what did Miss Smithson want me to do can you get out that recorder and listen Yeah or I can have it recording beside me so I could record everything and if I still remember it like it s so easy I can remember it I can just erase it Okay But I think the actual act of hearing it whole group with the rest of the kids in your room hearing it with just Miss Smithson telling it you saying it again yourself and then hearing what you said that may be all you need You may not have to listen to it again I think just making sure you re really concentrating on what the directions are is gonna be a really good thing for ya Okay also oop I gotta get something from over here Okay One of the other things we might do is maybe Miss Smithson might tell you something like give you a direction and she s gonna whisper it in your ear and then you have to whisper it to the person beside you And they re gonna whisper it to the person beside them and it s gonna go around the table until it gets back to you How many of you all sit at one group Five or six I think it s gonna be five cause we got two more kids Okay so sometimes Miss Smithson might say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay So then you have to whisper that into the ear of the person beside you What would you say Get out your pencil and get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay and then that person would have to whisper it to them Then it s gonna come all the way around and then the last person s gonna say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 60 Is that right I ll just turn back to em and say It s 50 It s 50 Okay okay That s another way we might make sure that we understand the directions before we get started Sometimes my teacher she just writes it on 
 Can you think of what what images are coming into your head about the Holocaust that relate to this Um people dying in the gas chambers Okay and and how did that happen He convinced other people that they were awful and then that s really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that Okay so you re saying Hitler couldn t have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the Jewish people were what Nothing They were just less than just a lesser race of people You re on a good track I ll check back with you in a second by stepping on another group of people So the other groups would actually help them Like we have to remember that the injustice the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it s not just injustice anyway you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing Well outside people like in Atlanta and Birmingham like in there like in Birmingham were being persecuted while people in Atlanta weren t really doing anything Well I mean look what s happening today I mean we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in Afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what Martin Luther King did for Alabama So you re saying you see a connection in the real world news That sort of our soldiers the fact that they volunteer would be an example for number five Is that what you are saying Yeah Had y all talked about number five yet Uh we were just going in order and seeing which ones that we could And yours is read me your quotation Um Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere Okay good Well you re just being to come up with things Okay go ahead I m just going to Okay so what s the first question Explain the context in which um Martin Luther King said this and how it applies in that situation Okay He doesn t want people to sit back and not do anything about a problem he wants them to go and help and stop It s almost as if their problem is his problem Is his problem Good I like that But even though he wants them to help well he doesn t want them to do it in a violent way Always need to underguard MLK with that don t we And that sort of ties into It s wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends Do you find yourself as you re discussing any one of these the others layer on there Yeah That s why it feels so important to have gotten this whole document as a whole Think you ve gotten enough from them Brianna for that one Yeah I think so Well I guess Clyde s already said that there s already one for the current news Yeah that we could put down So the volunteer soldiers Volunteer army Volunteer army I ll check back with y all good job are they more reluctant to like um listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it Yeah I think that s it Okay so in Watership Down the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior how do you spell that because I think I spelled that before privileges Privileges You know what to be honest with you every time I am typing I let spell check do it because that d and g always messes me up I was spelling superiority Superiority I m sorry Okay so what group have you chosen Colleen and what what Uh privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals And I hear that you re using a Watership Down example which My idea Your idea good for you And what is the um what Warren are we talking about The very first one um Sandleform Sandleform yeah Yeah go ahead and tell me about that Yeah it s like um the higher class rabbits didn t want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies Does that make sense to you India That s a good example I really like it Okay have you gotten anything else Um we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies What was the time in history Bish Um Number two Where this quotation applies is the Holocaust Um during Nazi rule people felt better about discriminating against the Jews because many others were also doing it So what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges Um actually I think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights Right so the whole group of what The whole group of um Nazis the Nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis But maybe they wouldn t have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality is that kind of where we are with this Yes Good well y all go ahead I m just going to watch a minute So I ll finish writing the Watership Down one the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to how about admit that some of the lower Number four would be easier to connect to a teenager s life that one actually fits for both of those What does Um for telling a time in a teenager s life um both of these the two parts of the quote would apply because it s like when you re getting like verbally abused it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual So if there s a whole group picking on you then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily So say say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who s sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there so they ask Hey you don t have to sit over at our table but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day They ll probably say No because they won t think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left And they don t want to go by the garbage cans Nobody wants to I think that s a good connection A good very present day connection Good I ll be back Yes of course Um Allison would you like to I have no clue would it be okay to write about like how people in foreign countries use like the sex trade as an it an I it relationship Certainly Mr Gallant s class We just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down That s okay that s okay that seems very real to me Okay fictional things so if it s fictional it doesn t have to be people I didn t say that we could use um what s that Watership Down I said we could use that did I not All right let s see Okay whatever I said we can use Hazel and the Warren for oppressed people that are not But I think we should do Efrafa because the bunnies like revolted and they got free remember Yeah That s what I m thinking I m hearing an argument where both of you think Watership would be a good connection but we re debating which what Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever Which Warren would like be better I think Efrafa Which one did you say Um the first one that came to from what was it called Sandleford Sandleford Okay tell me why you think that Because they were they had freedom but it was like they were just they couldn t do what they wanted all the time They could just do certain things in a certain vicinity They couldn t go out or go anywhere and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they um like revolted against their Warren and left What were you going to add Michael Oh like it was like a routine everyday like it was the same thing they followed like a routine like they went out and then ate and then slept But I think Efrafa is like that except for it s a lot worse like they didn t even get to go out like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed like right here and they d have to go right back into their Warren I think they re both good examples but I think Machi s is more able to be explained by that because they did but in his you know uh uh Hazel and Big Wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for They eventually got what they wanted In Efrafa they didn t get what they wanted until someone came in to And not everybody in Efrafa got out But not everyone in um Sandleford got out most of them didn t But I mean the group that we re talking about the main But the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted where they wanted Because no one else would listen Let me tell you something the main reason we re doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing will inform our later life It doesn t make me sad that you have two examples because when it s a little bit wrong or when it s a lot wrong because when you notice it when it s a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong so it kind of pleases me that you re seeing it at two different levels so I think use Efrafa and Sandleford and you ll have the best answer Okay Okay what are we working on We are trying to debate whether we should pick Cuba or Egypt as current events for for privileged groups so we can get Well let s hear your arguments Cuba Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for Metaphorically he s about to die He s still in power okay Egypt s been resolved already No Well they re arguing that it s not in the news but it s going on right now Well I think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we ve like talked about in class that s really really really And we all understand it What don t you understand about Cuba though Like there s nothing that s really in the news right now Cuba they still have the same old thing just like every other country that s happened just a little bit worse Here s what I m hearing You have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the Egypt example and it doesn t dis uh disvalue yours because it s important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he s talking about apathy when it s happened for a long time people don t less and less and less revolt Okay Could we possibly do Cuba in the history one Oh I think you could Work on that that s a great idea How are we coming Good we re done Good done I think we are finished I want to hear your uh everyday life one All right our for our teenager Yes All right we re saying like if there s a group of popular kids and they re like calling names and putting down a group of the not so popular kids and they re just not treating them like they re normal people too they re just treating them like lesser people Less than human They might they might not pay attention to them also they just In the way you wouldn t necessarily recognize a theme but in a way you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being Okay great So I want you as you re looking back over yours make sure that you ve given your reader or your listener enough information My shortest one was like three sentences and there s nothing magic about the number of sentences just check yours because you re a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there s any details you could add Okay great How are we coming Um good Pretty much done Awesome awesome You ve got three of the four Which ones did you do Um the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life And your quotation was Oh we did um it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons Thank y all for choosing that one that s a very hard one And we put And the third one great Now will some body tell me what your fictional one was Um we did why don t you explain this one Isabelle Okay I did Peter Pan Uh huh Cause when Peter Pan he persuades or he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them but he s doing it for the wrong reasons What reasons do you think he s really doing it To have a mother for the children the lost children And so he s not really thinking of their well being he s thinking of his and the lost boys well being Right What a great connection I m so proud of y all That s awesome And did you do news Uh we did history History what s your historical one Uh we did uh when the Europeans 
 How s everybody today Good Good Okay we are gonna work our bodies real hard today and we are gonna play a game called Wellness Uno How many people raise your hand if you ve ever played Uno Absolutely put your hands down Do you know that there are four colors in Uno Who knows what one color is Alexis what is it Blue What s another one Um red Red What s another one Nate Yellow Yellow Green Green absolutely Okay we ve got the Uno cards spread all around the circle here first graders And what we re gonna do is in just a minute you re gonna come up here and you re gonna get an Uno card I might pick this one right here this one is a Green four Green four Okay I look at it and then I put it right back If you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones Point to where the green color zone is Boom you got a green cone over there stay right there watch Ms Miller The green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station So if this is you have choices when you come over here first graders Choice number one you can get a rope and you can swing how many times Four Four Swing four times Which rope would be easier to swing on Alexis The knot one The knot one cause you can hang on to it better that s right So you can swing or can come over here and you can do those bicep curls that we ve been working on in muscular strength and endurance Stand right here to the wall and do that four times nice and what Slow Slow absolutely And here s your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station if I got what was my number again Four Four Look there s four hula hoops on the rock wall You would start here and you would go through hula hoop one then hula hoop Two three four What happens if I had a green two how many hula hoops would I go through Paige How many would I go through Two Just two Okay so it s either four whatever number that is that s the number of hula hoops you go through Then I come back over here and I pick another card Hmm did I pick this one oh I just picked that one Let s pick this one what color s that Yellow three Yellow three Point to the yellow color zone Absolutely the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone and guess what you have to do here first grade There is a cone here and it says yellow Add zero What was my number Three Three and if I add a zero to that what does that make that number Thirty Thirty That s what we re gonna have to do I have my choice I have to do thirty of something over here Here are my choices I m gonna do thirty oh gonna work my heart thirty step boxes Or if I don t wanna do that I can do the ball on the stick How many times Thirty Thirty And if I m really good and if I really wanna try I can get a jump rope right there on the wall and I can try jump roping thirty times Now I m gonna run back here and I m gonna get another card and I m gonna get this one right here This one is a Red six Uh oh Red nine Red nine it s a red nine see where that line is under there so that means it s a nine Red nine point to the red color zone Woo you guys are so smart I come over here to the red color zone and look what does the red color zone have on it Times two Times two so what was my number Nine Nine What s nine times two Say it Alexis Eleven Not eleven this is hard What s nine plus nine What is it Nathan Do you know What is it Ethan 18 It s 18 So we re gonna do 18 Ms Miller will help you with the math if you don t know so we re gonna times that one by two and here are my choices I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get a paddle and I m gonna this is a hand eye I m gonna use my hands and my eyes I m gonna put my safety strap on and I m gonna do how many of these 6 9 18 18 that s right 18 And first grade how can I challenge myself at this station If I wanted to make this station harder for myself how would I do that Courtney Um use your left hand Use your other hand Ms Miller is left handed so if I use my left hand I would use my right hand So if you want to challenge yourself you d use your other hand so you re gonna do that how many times 18 18 okay So that s you could either do that at this station or I love these these are the I call them the ice cream cones Look you throw that ball and you re gonna catch that ball Do it again that s how many Two Two And you re gonna do that all the way til you get to whatever number you have at that station That was using your hands and your eyes watching that ball right into that cup And now I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get one more and oh I just grabbed that one let s see what s oh what s this number Blue Blue six Where s the blue color zone point where s the blue color zone over there Hey the blue color zone is balancing watch Ms Miller over here You re gonna come over here and if you don t wanna touch the gym floor Ethan sit down for me you re gonna step on the stepping stones and you can either step on the sides of the ladder or if you wanna make it harder for yourself you can step on these rungs and balance all the way to the bleachers step up come across and then we re gonna go on this balance beam Hey first graders when we re balancing do we go fast or slow Slow Slow we go slow we don t wanna go fast at this station because we wanna have good balance and we don t wanna fall We wanna make sure we don t touch the gym floor So that s wait what was my number again I forgot Nine It was a nine red how many times would I go then Nine Nine times around there Or your choice is the hippity hops Now Ms Miller s a little big for this hippity hop but you kinda get the idea you just use the boing hop hop to the black line it s one and then back is how many Two So I would do that nine times Okay those are your choices so there s four stations yellow red excuse me green and blue Turn around and face Ms Miller now I wanna talk to you about something really quick it s something called personal integrity You ready back there Ethan Everybody sit on your bottoms sit on your bottoms Personal integrity and first does anybody know what personal integrity is do you think you know Maddie when you hear that what do you think that means Listening Listening okay what do you think Maria If you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card you can t put it back and get the one you want Ah Wow do I like that definition Absolutely personal integrity this is the way I think of it is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching You said it Maria you know what my favorite I really like those swing ropes over there I really like to do that Would I have personal integrity if I came over here and I did this I got a card and it s like ooh blue I don t wanna go to blue I wanna put that back Ooh there s another blue I don t want that Would I have personal integrity if I kept picking cards until I got what I wanted No Can Ms Miller watch every person get a card No No so you have to have some personal integrity Whatever card you get that s the one what happens if I just got a blue card and I come over here and I pick another blue one What am I gonna do what am I gonna do Paige You put it back down and you get another one but not the same one No no no we re not gonna get another one we re going to what it s okay You just go back to the blue station That s right you re just gonna go back to the blue station and just maybe if you did the hippity hops maybe do the balance drill next time Outstanding okay we re gonna get started this is what I want you to do Oh I forgot one more rule when you get a card do you ever run across the Indian No Do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out we don t wanna bump into anybody Nelson do you have a question Do you have a question about something You d probably rip the card You would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself Hands down let s get started I m gonna call months of the year And if I call your month of the year that your birthday is in then you re gonna get up and you re gonna go get a card Are you ready If you have a birthday in January February or March go get a card How bout April May and June July August September October November and December let s go What d you get Chris let s see man What is that talk to me Red eight Red eight do you know what eight plus eight is Eight plus eight think about that Almost 16 go do 16 of those good job buddy Hey Paige you wait on the end of the mat there until Alexis is done What s your number Alexis Four don t hold the bottom grab up at the top like Brian is doing that s perfect yeah What was your number One What was it One One did you do one Do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card Ooh Steven Steven what d you get man What is it Blue seven It s a blue seven go Hey Ethan what d you get Now remember the line means what A yellow six Okay what are you gonna do with that yellow six Wait come here look at me you re gonna put a No you re gonna add a what to the end of that A zero and that makes it what number 60 Yeah let s go Woo look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station they are going up up down down they are getting their heart rates up What number did you have Maddie Um 50 50 holy moly Keep counting It goes like this Maddie up up down down that s one Every time you hit the ground that s one okay Woo Be careful That s okay just hold it up like this Watch watch you see how it whirls like this at the bottom There you go like that it can get pretty hard Yeah Chris I saw one card that was um um it was turned over Oh did you So I flipped it over Oh really thank you so much I appreciate you taking care of the cards for me Here you go five times two what s five plus five Ten Ten that s what it is Jamie what d you get Forty Forty Did you get four yellow Go Woo look at these hippity hops over here Outstanding Man are you guys doing a good job I like how you re going really slow at this station that s good balancing Ooh Chris way to get your balance back Slow down buddy woah Nelson I know Can you put one foot in front of the other Can you bring your other foot in front Wanna try it Ms Miller s right here in case you have to grab onto me Yeah look at that what a good balancer you are I balance on the monkey bars You balance on the monkey bars Yeah Woo Good job You did it good job All right what d you get buddy Blue four Hey are you supposed to have your card with you I ll go put it back for you remember to leave the card Hey Jane did you run through the middle of the Indian Did you forget Don t do it again go on stay on the floor Way to practice How s it going over here Paige and Ethan Keep your eye right on that ball Ooh Paige that was close Right on there good job How bout you come over here What is eight times two What s eight times two Paige do you know that That s a hard one Nine Eight plus eight Eight plus eight kids Six times two what s six plus six Six and six put the two sixes together 12 12 That s what it is Just keep going there s new music coming on there s new music coming on first grade Keep it going Way to go there Nelson I like that Woo Your arms hurt You re getting a lot of good muscular strength What d you get here let s see What is that Yellow seven What are you gonna do to that seven You re gonna put a what on the end of it A what are you gonna put on it A zero What does that make it 70 Go Woo Maddie you got a blue Nine Yes No kidding Don t go running What is that card A yellow four And what are you gonna add to that four 
 What are you noticing about it compared to these two This one s light brown These are all dark So I think this one s not getting enough water So we should water it What s happening because it s not getting enough water It s like drying out What s happening to the seed The seed is dying It can t grow And the seed s gonna die Yeah Because what s the first stage of a life cycle And you have water in it It s a seed Yeah And then it sprouts But on this one all stems are dying Oh wow that looks really dry So which one are you measuring We re measuring water Okay let s measure it Let me measure it Okay let s measure it and let s record how tall it is I don t know how you use it Yeah almost four inches Centimeters Here I ll measure it Seven and a half centimeters Can you hold it yeah Maybe if you hold it Oh no it came out It s okay It s alright we ll just Ours came out and then it s still good Just hold him up It s six centimeters Okay let s check Wow it s growing two times enough Keep it there and let s see Let s see if the rest of your group agrees Yeah I agree That leaf is up to six centimeters Okay so what in in a week how much has it grown It s grown three Three centimeters Three centimeters yeah Three centimeters Okay write and record it So that s parsley Write write Why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato Because the tomato is like a tomato has one thing and parsley has the same thing and they come out What do you mean the same I think maybe because parsley Because parsley has a rose it s easier because because a tomato has more time to grow because it like it s the kind of vegetable that has Which is actually even drier Can you guys help her out Can you help her out I think well I think that s growing better than the roma tomatoes Is tomato a fruit Day one Like it s growing a fruit that s what the tomato is Like a vegetable it s the fruit of the plant Yeah That we eat But I think that what I think it s important is that we grow this Yes Yes they ll grow at different times Once they grow it ll grow fast Yeah we started this one planting faster right We started this one two weeks later Do you think we need to water the tomato more though Yeah When you look at the parsley and feel feel how wet that one is And it s doing so well I know Compared to the tomato maybe we need to water more Yes Is this parse It s the parts No it s the gender I think they need to get more sun and water Okay so Abby s measuring her tomato I did it What do you guys want to do Do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem Top of the leaf Top of the leaf The leaf is part of the plant Okay so you re putting it down all the way down Down and round It s four Okay It s four Alright Four So every single time when you measure this plant are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem Is that what you re going to do Yeah It started four sessions ago It started four sessions ago This one started two weeks before This one Let s look at the measurements and how much for growing can you compare these two What are some things that you notice I notice that It s grown three and a quarter centimeters Everything else won t be able to have two more centimeters G plant Can you tell me which one s growing quicker This one are pregnant Are you sure about that Yes Actually maybe because This started out and this one not so here before Okay and we started this one when We started this on I mean two weeks ago Two weeks after this one Yeah So even though this one was started later what s happened It s growing More Faster taller yup Okay Why do you think and you guys even noticed that it was dry and it s still growing faster Yeah So should we keep water should we water it more and see what happens Yeah What do you want to do I want to want to since there s no more seeds in there because we took two of them out and then the other one died I think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens Okay go ahead you can plant it And there are sometimes seeds they just won t germinate They re sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won t they won t grow Maybe that s what happened to this one too Can I go through and bob it But in the inside of it it looks very dark But the outside of it does So maybe it s not as dry as we thought Yeah Now we have to take measurements again We ll just see if that helps There s only this one left Let s look at this seed What do you notice about it I know for we came from last time when we grow the parsley this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed These are not dead How about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed It s really small And things can use the lines smaller maybe because they re smaller things or like a sunflower Oh so you think maybe the seed the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be Yeah Okay On that some of the tomatoes are as big as that or bigger than that Sometimes the seeds are how they start out are smaller but sometimes the shape of it sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes but others not You mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant Sometimes yeah It could What about a flower or something Flowers seeds are different They all look different No So is that always the case No But some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger And so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster or slower compared to these two plants than yours And maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference Alright you guys can get online Yeah you can go ahead and water it One in here and one in here And then I want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you e done You might want to water it a lot more Let me try And then over it We finished watering our plants Do we each get a computer We need help When we type into trying capitals in it it deleted our numbers So Okay We didn t know what was wrong Well you have your title Plant Type Let s be more specific because you re not doing all the plants What plant are you graphing right now Swiss chard And Kale Did you measure them already Yeah And then we drag the numbers but then they don t I think it s because of all that room James where is your measurement for swiss chard for today Right here You want to record that Swiss chard And kale was What was kale again Seven This height look correct No What are we missing Do you guys notice The up need Oh I notice There you go alright Okay so what s going to be your label for your bar graph That s the one going along the bottom The bottom the plant height How high the plant reading Are you gonna what are you gonna graph then for your bars Hmm What do we always look at when we re thinking about our graphs We always go back to our data table right What are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not Seven centimeters for kale You re gonna have to put kale right there I know It s just that was the big plan I think I m on the tail now because Okay you have what s this one That was eggplant Okay And this is swiss chard Yeah Well here s that why don t you measure that You haven t measured it yet About five centimeters Did you agree Walt Yeah about five centimeters Is that what you got too Yeah So why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard and just kale Or are we gonna have a graph for both together What would be easier Both together I think Should we put it together How would we do that How would you merge that I think like both should have their own bar like in the same graph I think so too So which plant do you want to graph today Are you gonna do swiss chard or kale They really needed help Let s do kale Let s look at kale Okay What s kale Here s the kale Which one are we measuring James what did you get for the height for kale Seven centimeters Okay look see if Andrew gets seven Yeah about seven Okay And what was the height of it last week James So Andrew knows It was six centimeters Okay it was six centimeters So just put six centimeters here There you go Okay so lets fix this let s just make it kale height Or grow And then what s this what are you gonna put at the bottom Look at your table The height of kale Is that gonna go along the bottom How tall it was like in day one and day two Let s look What were the labels for our table Date and measurement Okay so that s what we re going with So the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side Do you guys agree James You think that s right Okay we ll try it Go date and then go ahead and type measurement Should we have a unit on it since we re talking about measurement Mhmm Okay So the whole point of And what s in row one One four 13 Okay write that You re gonna put the date there Will would you like a turn Mhm Instead of doing commas if you re gonna write it like that you re gonna put a dash in between I m gonna have Will Will type this time We ll take turns So type in the date Okay and then what would go here under the What are you gonna graph Like what s gonna be the bar graph part Six centimeters No no the height was the another beam So type that in 
 Yeah I wanna talk to you some more This is cool that s probably how you attract them is start doing this Hey tell me why you think Adam he s able to do this again Because he has these legs like his legs stick to the ground so I think they can do it because they stick to the ground to get the strength then he pulls it up and he does it again Hey that sounds like a connection to what we ve been learning about the structures and the functions Yeah so when it s time to start making those connections I really want you to write that down with your team Just make sure that that gets on your paper Okay I want you writing out how many paper clips is this beetle pulling Two grams Two grams right now mathematician get busy Okay I m gonna keep putting another one on here to make sure Put four on there let s see if he can do it with four Hey little buddy don t don t don t No no no no pull him away What am I doing He s making a sound He s making a sound He s making a hiss He s making a hissing sound You think Why do you think he s hissing Maybe because he thinks we re trying to hurt him Yeah for self defense Yeah alright Let me go check in with some other teams You all keep working on your beetle Okay What s going on at your all s beetle team He s pulling The beetle is pulling two times its weight Two times right now Yeah So how many paper clips is that that he s pulling Two Three three He s pulling three Your beetle s not moving You think it s because of the loudness Yeah Class city class should you be going to other team s beetles I know it s fun and I know it s interesting but should you be going to other team s experiments No ma am You need to be engaged with your team Okay We re trying to Okay Did he pull two He s pulled two and then we re gonna He has pulled two Okay So let s see let s just give him a little nudge in the rear When I put a pencil right here he ll go after it Oh well see if that works do you think I know like earlier he was trying to get out of the bucket Let s see if he can pull it He s doing it He s moving Oh my gosh I see he s moving some but I haven t seen the paper clips move yet that s what we have to wait and see Are the paper clips going to move Wait I have to do my job They re moving They re moving So he just pulled three grams Okay so Did the beetle pull three grams Beth where s your sheet Go ahead help Talk to each other about what s happening Woah you can t hold him you have to leave him on the table Wrecking ball Somebody pick these up I got it You hold him up good teamwork You hold him up You re hurting him you re hurting him There we go now we ve got four paper clips on there Now lets put the paper clips behind him Now Talk to each other Talk to each other I think he s I think he ll be able to pull many many many Right now I think the beetle may be able to pull Eight eight That s how many we have Oh this team over here has eight I might need to go over Woah wait wait wait Get a green Let s see him in action I am noticing that we underestimated our beetles didn t we We underestimated our beetles didn t we Yeah Our beetles may be able to pull more than we anticipated We can do nine Okay Not yet not yet Keep working mathematicians keep track He s going Talk to me team about what s going on He can talk It can pull nine times It pulled eight Its body weight It is pulling nine times its body weight Wow how many paper clips is nine times its body weight Nine grams Nine grams Holy moly Did any of you all predict that this beetle would be able to pull nine grams No we only did all four We only thought four he d pull four We only thought four We only thought four Okay are you all making any connections How in the world is this beetle able to pull nine grams of paper clips Nine times its body weight What do you think Oh now look when it s on the desk is it able to do it No its harder for him to do it on the desk Why can t it do it on the desk I think he might have a better grip on the construction paper What grips better What structure is gripping better on that construction paper Because it has It s because it s got it s got like suction cups and I guess it s not used to the slippery desk It has claws to pull it It s pulling it I think it looks really It s what Abby Even though it s really loud in here its still moving It s still moving even though it s loud in here that s right I think it just wants to go to Justice You think the beetle s trying to go to Justice I don t know about that Are you gonna try a tenth paper clip Yep Yes Look look ten Ten paperclips Let s see He s taking your pencil He s wants to get your pencil Oh why do you think Because it s wood Because he likes wood And what type of animal is the beetle Bess Betsy beetle But what do they do Why do they eat wood They are It s pulling ten Why does the bess beetle eat wood Look at him I don t know if he s pulling ten or not Look at him Because he s a decomposer He is a de He is barely pulling ten He s having to work really really hard Yeah I think it s probably time to stop adding them to the beetle you think I put max Maximum is ten Do you think we can add Class city class if your beetle is struggling and like arching its back and like flipping its legs but it s barely pulling it it may be time for you to give the beetle we don t wanna be mean to the beetle Our max was ten Okay So we re left on thank you for taking them off Alright class city class Yes baby yes Put your eyes on me Oh I m waiting I m waiting Thank you Most of us have come to the point where the beetle is struggling okay And having a hard time pulling the weight At this point if your beetle is struggling it is time to start the summarizer and the connector job Okay so I wanna hear you talking summarizing connecting what has happened Let s give him a rest Yeah let s give him Wait don t pull that Oh my gosh How many is he pulling Seven Okay here I ll bring you some more Where are the rest of your paper clips Right there Get off He s starting pulling Okay oh be nice to my beetle friend I m trying to He keeps on getting his foot stuck to my hand Hi little buddy Oh I almost touched it We learned before that beetles Hang on you re learning that beetles what That beetles are really strong but with their little legs and their thorax maybe Their thorax you think is what makes them really strong Because the thorax it may be the biggest part in their body Yeah it is probably the biggest part What else on their legs what on their legs are helping it Their Look at it I know what it is Their The thing that s sticking to the table and helping it move faster Okay so the sticky part on their feet Here let me do it Yeah okay You all have done a really nice job noticing what structures of this beetle are helping it to be so strong How do you think it uses that in the wild Like out in nature How do you think it uses that It s functional and it almost You may even think it s cool but he could use his wings to fly away Some beetles do have wings to fly away but what do you think is I need you in your seat Nathan what do you think it s using to move Its that s a lot of strength Its abdomen Right okay its abdomen is but in nature What might it use that for It might use it to catch its prey maybe Okay what does it What does it do What does it eat It may eat Casey say it again to your team Organic and it breaks it down It breaks it down What is that called What type of insect would It s a it s a d A d A d A d A D A disposer Not a disposer close A decomposer That s it Not a disposer but a decomposer good And so okay think it s okay Think about if it was trying to dig into the wood of a tree Wouldn t it have to be really strong It can make a hole In the wood of the tree That little thing the little might be to decompose the wood So it can bite and then break down It s really gonna have to be biting harder Yeah that mouth part is really strong to bite Okay so now may I have your attention how many do you have We have 10 You have 10 and it s pulling it let s send him home I want 11 They re moving look at his legs how hard they re trying to pull You might he might be able to pull 11 I m gonna give him one extra No No 12 Okay you all keep working on that you re doing a great job Thank you I wanna come back to my very first team Carrying 10 10 Ours can carry 11 Yeah It did Yeah And he pooped on the paper Okay it pooped Twice It pooped twice Yeah twice Okay let me put this here I don t know where to put it There we go So what are you doing Are you adding 11 We re gonna see our 11 puller You re gonna do 11 What connections can you make The legs are like a crayfish The legs are like a crayfish Yeah How They have joints They re jointed How do you think those joints help that beetle to pull 11 times its body weight The beetle is like a able to grab on Yes so Tim s saying something say it loud It helps it walk It helps it walk but And escape from predators And escape from predators how Because What might it do with those powerful legs What did we notice them doing in their containers They get under the what They get under the rocks and the dirt Like Tim like when he was on the corner Tim was like picking him up and he was holding on to the paper He was holding the paper Tim lift him up Okay Oh yeah it s neat I can make a connection What s your connection If we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk up stairs if we didn t have jointed legs If we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk upstairs right Is that what you said Coner You re okay You re okay Alright I want you talking to each other Help Halle she s writing down some of your connections Help her team help her Talk to Halle What s another thing The aphid s have pincers and the bess just have Tim s telling you something It has little like claws Hang on Tim s telling you something Listen to Tim The aphids have pincers and the beetle has these things that helps it eat out the wood They look like little They look like pinchers The beetle has a pincher like a crayfish A pincher like a Oh this could pull 11 Good connecting keep connecting 
 A lot of people thought the mass of the water in the bag would be less than the mass of the ice cubes in the bag How many people One two just three of you Okay Cameron do you want to start us off with your reason why Because the cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer then that water bottle will like explode because it has so much ice in it Okay So because the water when it freezes expands then therefore you re saying it has more mass Yeah When it s frozen Yes But when it melts it doesn t take up so much space so it has less mass Yes Okay Michael Do you or are you on the same idea as far as more as far as thinking there s less Was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it s going to be less Mine was the same Same idea Yeah Okay Hannah you got a thought or something Well isn t it like the same Isn t it like the same thing because it s the same thing It s just expanding but it s going to have the same mass When you re saying it s the same thing what do you mean by the same thing Like if you have water in a water bottle like it does expand or whatever but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass Okay so Hannah s saying it doesn t matter that it expands It s still the same amount of stuff and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass Is that correct Kay Houston idea on that Well about the water bottle thing it would be opposite to this cause when you start with water it takes up the entire bottle But the bag the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag So it wouldn t So are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt are you saying the mass is going to go up It s going to increase Yeah Okay Colby I d say that when a solid turns into a liquid its form changes but not its mass Okay so kind of the same idea as Hannah Only you re talking about the actual forms then It can change form without changing mass Hannah says it s okay to expand because it s still the same amount of stuff Okay Michael s got another thing thing to talk about Well when you put like the water in the bottle and then you like freeze it then you unfreeze it then there s less water than what you started with and it probably would change the mass Why is it so you re saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out Yeah Do you have a reason why that might be Well no it s just Okay any other ideas on this one Okay how many people thought the mass would increase then How many people said the mass would increase A couple of you Jared why don t you tell us why you think the mass would increase I thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice Like if you pick up a bottle of water that s frozen it doesn t weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it Okay So Jared says that water weighs more than ice Correct Anybody else have a different idea Anna Well because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass so if it thawed back out then it d weigh more Okay So Anna s using the example that she s seen ice floating on water therefore she s saying the ice must have less mass than water Correct Is that what your e saying Mm hmm Colby you got something to say about that I have something to say about that It will stay the same going off of what she s saying Oh going off of what she s saying Okay go ahead then Ice is pretty much the same as it s water it s frozen water so it still has the same density as water it s just colder So if it s colder it floats Ice because it s cold it floats in the water So you re saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass it has to do with its temperature Kay Houston Well I think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn t completely full There s some air in there Okay So Houston s saying there s some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand Okay Anybody else Anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the Oh sorry Anna Oh okay I disagree with Colby how he said that it floats because it s cold when heat rises and so if it s cold wouldn t it sink if it had to do with the temperature Okay so Anna s saying that heat rises and cold sinks so you don t think it has to do with temperature Yeah Okay Colby response to that or are you Well in water it works differently Warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually and cold water s more on the top Alright So if you put cold in ice it will float above Okay Oh I have some hands up now Michael Well when you re in the lake for example the warm part s on top and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises So you re using your experience in swimming or something in a lake Yeah It s colder the deeper you go warmer towards the surface you re saying Yeah so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath we float up Okay When we have no air we go down Okay so you re saying an ice cube has air trapped in it that s what s causing it to float Is that what you re saying And Hannah were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing Yeah so when you put your sweater or something in the water it s like the top is usually more warm colder Okay Alright Now people who think the mass is going to stay the same Who are those people Who thinks the mass will stay the same Gavin why don t you give us the reason why you think it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because nothing s lost when it melts Nothing goes away It s still the same thing He s saying it s going to stay the same because nothing is lost When it melts it doesn t get lost Okay Anybody else who says it s going to stay the same have something to add Gabe I said that Just talk louder I said that it ll stay the same because there s still the same amount of water melted or frozen and even if it s in a bag if it melts and tries to break down into gas then it s still in the bag so it won t go anywhere So Gabe s saying that it doesn t matter if it s frozen as an ice cube if it s melted as water or even he s even going as far as saying that even if the water liquid starts turning into a gas it s still going to be the same because nothing s leaving the bag Is that what you re saying He s going even a step further he didn t even mention anything about turning into a gas but he s saying even if it does that it s still not going to change Right Houston Well I disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top it doesn t freeze all the water Okay Hannah I agree with what he said Even if there s air bubbles in the ice then after it melts the air bubbles it s still in the bag It s still concealed in the bag So sounds like the people who are for it staying it s the same are really sticking with the fact that everything s in the bag Nothing s out of the bag or leaving or coming in and then the people who are thinking it s going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid and then some of that s through the temperature Michael one more before we move on About how it all stays in the bag well when you melt water it sweats So wouldn t it lose some of that So are you saying some of the moisture s going to be on the outside of the bag Like comes off the bag If you have it on the table then it comes onto the table Like how it has a Okay so here s my question to you then That water that s on the outside of the bag that you re talking about You were saying that water came from the inside of the bag Well it sweats from the the compression of the temperature So you re saying that s what s causing the mass to go up then Wouldn t that cause the mass to go down Okay so that s my question to you then is where was that water on the outside coming from Inside How is it getting to the outside I don t know Some scientific theory Okay Does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside Yeah Do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out James how do you think that water might be getting to the outside The moist is like when it What s it called Wait a minute The carbonate the condensation it like seeps out like the air it seeps out So somehow you re thinking it s seeping through the bag Colby I know how that happens actually Because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it s colder So it ll stick there and just condense there so it ll look like it s It s just water from the air So you re saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside It s coming from the outside which is different than what they re saying Cameron did you have any other ideas how it might be getting out there Kay Alright So we got some different ideas on that one Let s move on now to our alka seltzer problem This time last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease Let s start with the people who think the mass will increase So people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka seltzer Who are those people Alright We re going to have Kyle start us off on this one What s your reason why Kyle Well when the tablet dissolves I think after dissolving water will rise and make more Make more water Yeah Okay So Kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water and therefore more mass Sam different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase Okay so you re thinking it s going to increase because you re adding something to the water Colby I think it s going to increase because the alka seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside Okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass Jake you had your hand up for the mass increasing correct Do you have a different reason why it s going to do that So basically saying the same thing as Colby More gases Hannah Aren t the gases from the water in the alka seltzer aren t they going to just stay the same Good question So what you re saying then is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water so what are you saying the mass will do I think it s going to stay the same Actually it ll decrease It ll decrease Okay why do you think it s going to decrease I don t know Okay Who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease Cameron Why is it going to decrease Because the acid from the from the from the tablet the acid from the tablet is going to release gases and the water will go out of the beaker How is the water going to get out of the beaker Because the tablet will react with water and the gases will float away But isn t there a lid on top Maybe the lid will pop off or something Let s assume the lid is does not pop off Let s assume I have it on there tight enough that it s not going to pop off Then since air is lighter than water then that means that the air that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much and there will be more gas in the container So Correct me if I m wrong So you re saying that assuming the top stays on it s still going to decrease That s the decrease right Because the solid and liquid are going to turn into Gas Gas and gas is lighter than solids and liquids Is that correct What you re saying Yeah Alright Jared has something to say about that I think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be decrease Okay so he s saying that the tablet disappears then the mass will go down That piece that the tablet s bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore Kevin what are you thinking Pretty much the same thing that the tablet s going to dissolve into the water And so mass will go down Yeah Okay Who thinks the mass is going to stay the same It s not going to change Who thinks it will stay the same Why don t you tell us why it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because the water the alka seltzer piece is a water it s just in a different form But everything is still Okay So you re saying because nothing s going away it s still going to be the same It s just in a different form So kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water Gabe do you have a different reason than that No it was a lot like hers It was the same as hers pretty much Yeah Okay Anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka seltzer one Why it might go up down or stay the same before we move on Gavin I said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle it ll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water like the same amount Okay so you re going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet And since we re turning them into gases the mass will go down James I said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked once it mixes with the water it ll stand making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher The mass will increase because it ll produce the Alright Let s go to burning paper Alright Burning paper Let s start with the people this time let s start with the people who think the mass will stay the same People who think the mass still stay the same Colby s the only one Morgan Gabe Not very many Jasmine Morgan why don t you start us off for why you think it s going to stay the same I said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it s not going anywhere Okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere Jasmine you had your hand up Do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same I agree with her You agree with what she said Colby Burning stuff does not add It s still the object but it s more spread apart Okay so the mass stays the same you said It s just we re going to take up more space with it Okay Michael No Yes I was stretching Hannah I disagree with that because it when it burns I don t know if that s the word for it but how it s causing it all when you burn wood in a fire eventually all that will turn into ashes so I don t think it has the same mass or anything Okay James you got some more on that When that paper burns it ll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper and then that ll make it so mass will be decreased Okay so given the idea that we re taking the solid things and we re changing them into maybe non solids so either liquids or liquid acids they re not gonna have as much mass as those Edward what do you think Do you think this mass will go up down or stay the same I think it will decrease Decrease Yeah And what s your reason for that Cause when the paper burns it turns into a gas so some of it and then gas is has less mass than solid objects Okay so again back to that gas is less mass than solid objects Kayla what do you think Increase Decrease Or stay the same I thought it would decrease like what Hannah It ll disintegrate Okay So as a quick vote how many people thought on this one oh sorry Kevin go ahead Also I think it s gonna decrease because the paper s gonna burn and incinerate but also the match when you light the match it s gonna burn too Okay Some of you maybe forgot about the match I haven t heard you mention it until just now so that not only is the paper gonna burn up but so will at least part of the match Okay cause it s burning too alright A quick vote How many people on this one said the mass would go down would decrease And how many said it would increase And how many said it d stay the same So the majority of you are on the decrease side on this Okay here s my next question We ve now heard what a bunch of people had to say about each different situation One if it would increase or decrease or stay the same My question to you now is that after listening to all the people throw ideas out there has anybody changed their mind on any of these In other words like maybe for the ice in the water one I was thinking it was going to increase but after listening to every one now I think it s gonna decrease 
 Okay so what we re doing is you guys are trying to figure out which one of these invisible tapes yeah is the best So the first thing you gotta do is come up with a nice question for your problem that you want to solve Sharonda you wanna share what you ve come up with Which tape is the strongest Which tape is the strongest okay Now see that s good because you don t like We were discussing earlier you don t wanna say which tape is the best because you really don t know what does the best mean Strongest stickiest longest lasting but I like it which one s the strongest Do you ladies have any ideas I said it was Scotch Well we were gonna hang the same amount of tape up the edge of the table and stick a marble to the other side and see how long it holds the marble for and that s how you can determine which one is the strongest Okay so y all have marbles I have You got some marbles that sounds fine So you re gonna do a sort of a time test which one can last longest okay That might work You might wanna do a little test run tomorrow because if it s something where their gonna sit there the tape s gonna sit there with a marble on it for be able to get that done So you might wanna think about maybe adding marbles to see which one can hold the most or do something to the tape to make it drop the marble I don t know what that might be We re gonna come up with some more creative ideas I was gonna maybe cut like like this tape is cut halfway into it to see how long it will hold with the marble on it Oh once it s been cut Yeah That would be good okay But and again you have to make sure that you cut each tape the same distance You gotta be fair So what about give me a passionate sample hypothesis that y all came up with If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stay on it longer If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stick to it longer So in your hypothesis you re mentioning the type of tape and you re mentioning what you re measuring Okay I m having trouble finding the group control experimental manipulator Okay remember think about your variables think about the especially for your manipulated variable what you re changing between the groups The tape Yeah the types of tape I understand Okay I ll come back and we ll discuss the other ones Alright guys Josh Sir since y all have already been working a little bit give me a sample question what you re problem is the question that you guys came up with Our problem it was which paper towel sucks up more water Okay so you Absorbs more water Absorbs more water or sucks up that s fine We re just nice and simple it means the same thing So you guys are going straight for absorbency Yes sir What about a hypothesis Darren If Brawny Bounty and a name brand paper towel are tested then Brawny will absorb the most water Nice and simple nice and simple See you mentioned all the different brands right in the beginning and then you picked one and said exactly what it would do better absorb the most water Okay perfect Now have you got any idea how you re gonna test the absorbency Any ideas about your procedure what kind of method are you gonna follow to figure out which one absorbs the most water We re gonna use water What do you need with water Like water we need water We need water yeah We need water but how are you gonna use the water to test it First we ll get a measurement of how much water we have in a container And then we ll put the towel in the container and see how well it sucks up the water To see if the level drops and we ll measure it from there So you re saying put a known amount of water in some kind of container and we ve got tons of beakers we can use Then put the paper towel in there take it out How long you gonna let it sit in there Like a minute Well you gotta know You gotta come up with the time and it s gotta be right on Cause you don t wanna leave Bounty in there for 10 seconds but Brawny for 40 seconds That s not fair You ve gotta keep it equal But that s the kind of stuff you ve got to think about You ve got to be detailed Alright and then you re gonna measure what liquid is left in the container Yes You can do that Yeah that ll work okay nice and simple So whichever one leaves the least amount of water behind should be the best as far as absorbency Yes Okay For our procedure we re trying to think and like maybe you could put like three of the same stains on one sock and then test it without one You definitely need to use the same stain You don t wanna have Zout going against coffee and Clorox fighting mud That s definitely a good idea so what kind of stains might you use We ll use what kind of we got We can use food coloring Yeah food coloring I actually have some food coloring Or we could use I got some barbecue sauce Barbecue sauce As long as you do not eat it during the lab That s fine I like that Because that s more natural I mean Ketchup And that s already measured for you like in packets that may not be a bad idea Or mustard Maybe yeah now if you re gonna do those kind of liquids we ll have to find a way to measure it We can use hot sauce Or hot sauce Okay that works that is more liquidy that might actually work Because we can pour it out we can use pipes or you can use pipets or beakers or something to measure it out so that each sock gets the same amount You don t wanna again don t wanna put twice as much hot sauce for this to fight than this one that s not fair Yes sir Okay what kind of hypothesis Our hypothesis was if we test all three samples Test all three and then I believe that the Clorox will remove the stain faster So you re picking Clorox why d you pick that Because the Clorox is sponsored by more by more varieties of stain removers and they beat So in other words you ve seen commercials about it Yes sir So you re taking what you know inferences like we talked about talking about what you know and making a prediction This one seems familiar have you heard of Zout No sir Okay most people say they haven t I don t know why I picked the same one because that s the only one I d heard of And the reason why we said Instead of using a marble which I forgot at home and we used weights but they were way too heavy So we put a glue stick on a piece of each tape that was about 10 centimeters long and we made a cut in it that was one centimeter because one half centimeter was too steep or thick And then we recorded it and we found that the first one that dropped was this one which was a second it didn t hold on at all And then this one was 17 seconds and then Scotch proving to be the strongest dropped at 79 seconds 79 seconds alright cool So what does that data then tell you Sharonda You said when you collected it what are you looking at what you found out with your data What does it prove That the Scotch tape is better And it s not even close So I like how you guys have chosen to use a bar graph because I can just look at it I can just look at it and go wow look at that The bar is up so huge compared to the other two Okay so it s very easy to distinguish which one did the best Okay Did you find maybe ladies that you had any kind of error Well yeah the first time I cut into the tape I cut too deep like twice Cut too deep Yea and then we found out the weights just tore right away They were way too heavy They wouldn t even hold on when I let go So you re very careful about making it drop Yeah Alright cool Okay so what kind of data are you collecting Mark I mean what kind of data are you guys trying to put together We trying to figure our which one is stronger which one would last the longest Right now we re seeing which one lasts the longest for how many times we rinse it This is the first time we re rinsing it and then we re trying to wipe it up again Okay and this is still the This is still corn syrup Still the corn syrup Okay cool alright that ll work So how are you gonna organize this I ll chart a graph and we re gonna see how which one tears first on which rinse So you re just going straight up by the numbers before it rips Kind of simple so that gives you that generates you some numbers to use okay Alright Michael did you guys I know you re still kind of in the middle of collecting your data Anything you see that can be done better something maybe you made an error with Something that seems to not be working like you expected Dropping this one Okay That was one That was one alright anything else Maybe that you re noticing with your anything that you re noticing with your procedure that you could to make it This guy could help out a little bit more We could ve put this stuff in a little beaker thing would ve made it easier Put what in the beaker Our solutions and stuff so we could ve put it in there That way we have an exact measurement That s true okay so what what you re saying is that your experiment may have some errors because you don t really know what s left We got measurments but we don t have exact measurements So you think it would ve been better to do that if you were to do it again that s what you might do Okay alright cool Carry on Okay hi Jeff and Keosha Alright so you re right in the middle of collecting your data Do you have a have you come up with a data table yet Designed how you want it to look Not yet how do you think you want to You gotta make it organized when you put your data in How you gonna write it down Any ideas What about a graph Well you re definitely gonna have a graph too But you also need a data table to record it now that you re starting to get some results I don t know to do that like Okay well we ll just think about it then make something up What do you think will be the easiest way to organize Okay let s do this what results are you looking for The best thing stain cleaner Okay based on what I mean what are you using as your rule to say that they clean the best Color change or Yeah Okay How much it took off How much it took off how are you gonna measure how much it took off By by the color Or do we need to use something I don t know this is up to you guys This is your experiment What do you mean by the color Like how dark it went to light From darkest to lightest Okay you do that I mean you could compare it side by side That s a good way like a scale sure You got any other ideas You could do that Alright so let s just say you went straight up we re gonna compare the original color to the new color How can you organize that into a data table What kind of information would you need to put in there The color Yeah the color change Okay so the color changed You definitely have to have the brands you ve gotta know which one did what So how are you gonna write down the color change How could you organize that into a chart That s hard I know I know I think you already told me the answer What would you say you were looking for what did you say you were looking for The color change How were you gonna compare it From darkest to lightest From darkest to lightest okay So isn t this sorta like before and after So maybe you can have a somewhere in your data table a column or a row where you re talking about what the color is before describing it So it s gonna be what kind of data since you re describing it What kind of graph should we use We ll get to that in a second So what kind of data is that where you re just writing down like descriptions and colors That s what we ve been working on We re not using numbers Well we ll get to the graph in a second You know what kind of data it was where we collect descriptions and colors and words It s right there Say it It s You ve got a Quantitative Well that s numbers Qualitative Qualitative so that s what you re doing Now how you gonna put that in a graph From the darker shade to the lighter shade right Decide what goes where Okay that sounds good to me What kind of graph I don t know If you re trying to compare and contrast these Double bar graph Sure That would probably work Okay here so you guys have been working on which paper towel absorbs the most liquid I see y all have a data table that nice and simple Record how much water they Absorb Absorb how much water they absorb And what kind of conclusion Ms Goodwin could you draw for your data For my data I drew that Southern Homes had absorbed the most water And then Brawny absorbed the next absorbed the next most And then it was Bounty was the last Bounty came in last but only barely Only by one So Josh Yes Based on the results that your group got how would you how would that change your thinking In other words how might that change your shopping habits if you had these to choose from Well I would pick Southern Homes more than any of the other brands because it absorbs more And isn t that what it s supposed to do Yeah Okay So Darren looking back at y all s procedure looking back at your entire lab is there anything that maybe if your were to redo this lab right is there something you might would change about it to make it better or more accurate Yes I would use different measurements of water like three of them Three Yes You mean like repeated Like maybe for each paper towel do it three times Yes Okay alright that s actually a pretty good idea because when you do those extra trials it helps to eliminate mistakes Because you could ve found out with these two being so close if you would ve had time to be able to do it two more times you could have found that maybe on average Bounty ended up beating Brawny or vice versa you never know Okay Mia What about what about your hypothesis was it right Did you pick the correct one No I picked Brawny Brawny okay so what kind of new hypothesis based on this Let s say that you guys came up with a whole new idea that was different from what you did this test Like another whole procedure like Darren was saying do it multiple times maybe it s completely different What kind of new hypothesis would you make if you were gonna do a similar experiment with a twist to it I would pick Southern Home Just because it won this one Yeah Okay so based on your results you might choose the same one Anybody think they would choose a different one I d still stay with the same one Which was which one Brawny Why would you still pick Brawny Because it was close it wasn t it was like it wasn t that close but if we would ve made like more if we had tested it more then it would ve probably stayed And so do you think it s possible It is possible that if you did a completely different test than just seeing which one sucked up water maybe if you tested strength Brawny could have won that one Yes I know it could Okay cool I like how y all did the lab it was nice and simple And other then Darren s error did you see anything that anything else you would do differently Anything else that you feel that you could have done better other than just maybe doing it extra times Test to see like how thick it is Test the thickness of the paper towel Yes Are you straight So in other words have a second type of test Okay sure I ll probably change the temperature of the water Change the temperature of it Yeah Oh that s true So you have to add in different variables because maybe one of them works better under Heat or lasts better under higher heat okay Cool awesome Tim It s okay Tim doesn t have to be over here So let s see what kind of chart you have Now explain this chart to me Deontay because all I m seeing is check marks I did mine I just did something simple Okay that s fine I put my name right there and I put if it left a light stain I left a check mark and if it left a dark stain I meant stain I put a check mark Okay so I see some of y all are still working on your graphs and how you wanna display them Alright So why did you choose a bar graph So we can do like the levels of the stains we got like medium Medium Light and dark Let me see So you saying you re doing you re going kind of like a qualitative data light medium dark and you re just sort of shading up to the level you think that it had Okay how could you do that better What might be a more reliable way to gather data I mean the color change is okay I mean the color change is fine because that s what you re looking for right When you buy a stain remover you wanna see that it takes the stain out What might be some more reliable data you could gather if you were to do this differently for the future You need to come up with a creative way to get better data or more data maybe The more data we can get is by looking through the sock up under the sock to see how dark the color went through Okay so compare the levels and how much stain was pushed through the sock Yes sir Alright that ll work What else Or we can tell by if it s a light if it s a ring around a light spot then we can tell if it cleared and if it clears some color off of it So you re talking about maybe the shape of the stain or Yes sir the shape of the stain Okay possibly And if it s a ring around it like this one right here if it s a ring around it it s a light spot and we can tell it isn t t clean enough Alright so how about this Whose opinions did you use to get these scales I used my own for mine Okay Cause they think that one was the best and I think this one was the best So what might be think about this what might be a better way a more reliable way to get more data than just your opinions Ask other people s opinions Ask other people Again if you were to redo it do you think it would be a better idea to maybe ask some other people Yes Like going around the class asking what they think Getting a vote Like a vote like a survey Yeah a survey Or a vote okay Alright last thing Now that you ve finished it what kind of problems did you see Is there something that okay if I did this again I know we could ve had some error during this point like we could ve made a mistake here We saw that if we woulda let the colors and the stain remover sit a little longer that it wouldn t have come out 
 How much bigger is one than the other It s like a thousand times It s like four times Wait Those zeros are really skinny Well they weren t too bad It s quite a big difference isn t it So is our picture drawn to scale No No Can we make judgments on what s happening by our picture No Not unless its drawn to scale right Rachel how would we redraw that to make it more in line with our numbers Which side is bigger The one with the negative Okay so we want to make that three times seven to the sixth minus six much smaller right Yes Would you please redraw Make it about a fourth of the size I ll try You can just do a new one Don t forget arrow tips please Okay Now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side Okay so do we use our picture to make judgments Yeah Okay only if it s to scale Thank you ma am Okay Sam You understand that Okay Alright now one more thing we needed to do for the Yeah Go ahead That hypotenuse has got a curve It s okay We ll make allowances He doesn t have a straight edge up at the board Okay Raci what else do we have to do here Find the direction Find the direction Raci how would we go about doing that Okay so tangent No that s fine We can use tangent Which numbers will we use then Okay And Pardon me Are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now No We well yeah we re going to We just didn t write it that way To solve for Theta we would do inverse tangent okay Now what do I tell you always to do with this Make sure It s in degrees In degrees A couple of you had it in radians That s because in Precal we I understand that but So Okay now we have the angle Is that the angle of the resultant No What would you do Jonah 180 Add 180 because It s in the third quadrant Drew would you agree with that Yes Because Because the resulting forces can t They can t there s no forces in the other quadrants so the resulting force couldn t possibly be in another quadrant Okay but how do we measure that angle Counter clockwise from East Okay good Alright Any questions Sam Question I didn t add the 180 but then I put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest That would be fine So you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is Alright Now do you guys feel better about this problem Okay John Can you measure that from I said it was I m pretty sure this is incorrect but 12 and a half degrees west of south I mean now that I realize it s Yes you could have I guess it s technically the same thing It would have been west of south Did I mark it wrong Yeah Alright well just show it to me later I might have just missed that angle there Okay I ll make that correction for you John Okay Let s go on Jonah Jake thank you Jonah you re going to the board for this one What should I write We can erase all of number one Taylor would you please read the problem for us Sure A proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640 What does that say Newtons over Coulombs Okay let s stop there for a second Hold on Don t erase the nanocoulombs You see the difference between an N slash C and a lower case nc Sometimes if you re reading too fast you are going to mess those up I do it myself So always take a good look at the units Units help inform you what you have Okay thank you At some later time its speed is 1 2 times 10 to the second For A you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton For B how long does it take the proton to reach the speed C how far has it moved in an interval And D what is the kinetic energy at the later time Okay so Connor Calling on you again here Magnitude of the acceleration How would we go about finding acceleration normally if I just said Connor tell me how to find acceleration What s the first stuff that comes to mind f equals m a f equals m a Okay or a equals f over m f over m Jonah a equals f over m We re working with a proton Mass isn t given in the problem but is that going to be an issue for us No No because that s our table of equations So the mass of a proton 1 67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg So we have that part but we don t have the force So Rachel how might we find the force Isn t the e equals f over q so we can use the charge of the proton to find the To find the charge and what s e It s a constant No no no its not a constant Oh isn t it the 640 newtons over coulombs right And what does e represent Rachel The electric field Electric field good So if we solve this for force what is that going to be F equals Okay you can plug numbers in first too that s good Jonah Can you slow down for some of us please Yeah Jonah you re not supposed to be looking at your sheet so put your sheet down What did Jonah just write up there Okay he went too fast So let s back up He plugged in the variables He plugged in the numbers But do we all know where that equation came from Green sheet Green sheet And e is the Electric field Good okay And f Force q The charge of a proton Alright So now do you all know the charge of the proton It s equal to the charge of an electron Very good alright now we can find force right What was the force then 6 13 times 10 to the 10th I got 1 02 times 10 to the ninth That s the acceleration Oh my bad Yeah I was doing acceleration F equals 1 67 1 024 How did I get this problem right Oh there it is right there 1 024 x 10 to the negative 16th And that brings up another good point Write your work more clearly right Because if you can t follow your own how do you expect me or the AP reader to do that So do yourself a favor Make sure its clear Okay Where do we go from here Ann Back to a equals f over m And we have force and we have mass now right Okay now I have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two A John lead your classmates through 2 B Okay 2 B You have Do you want me to lead the class I want you to ask questions Don t tell us I want you to ask questions okay Okay So you need to find time So what equation would you use Jonah stop using the sheet No I told him he could use it Wouldn t it be velocity equals acceleration times time It is Yes Oh come on Jonah don t It s actually v o times x times t not x v o times t That s right Isn t it v o times t You are thinking of the equation for displacement Oh yeah x times v o Well v o is zero because it s from rest Alright Drew what would you plug in The speed that you re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration Oh the speed is 1 2 x 10 to the sixth and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem into that equation and solve it So t equals No John s leading Class what does t equal 1 96 times 10 to the negative fifth Negative fifth or negative seven Five Alright Sam you lead for part C Read part C You lead Part C How far has it moved in the interval And if you look up to the problem nope you don t have to look up to the problem You look up to number B which we just did Number B Yes you do Number B and you look at the time that we just found and that s going to be the interval Thank you Jonah So how are we gonna find time Ann Or distance Sorry distance Why d you ask me a question You told me to ask you a question No I didn t Alright anyone else know Gretchen you look like you know What s the equation to find distance in number C Distance equals velocity times time Nope That s not what I got But I guess you could do that You could do that No you can t You can t do that Why not Because I was gonna do that at first Gretchen but then I thought in my head that since the object s accelerating the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel I have an equation You have an equation Ann I do What is it How about x equals x the original x plus v o times times t plus one half a v squared So what do we know about v o and x o Ann That they are just zero So what can we do to both those first parts of the equation Just throw them out the window Drop it like a bad habit Drop it like it s hot So that would be half times acceleration times time squared And conveniently letter A letter A we found the acceleration which was what Drew 6 13 x 10 to the 10 Nice is just and the time in letter B What was it Raci 1 93 times 10 to the negative So if you pound that out on the calc Can we just pound it out You cannot just pound it out because you have to Do what Miranda I don t know Put the square in there Change back to degrees Oh you snuck it in Snuck what in The square I don t think I said the square No I didn t but Jonah thank you for saying the square for me Pound that out in sig fig wise what do you get I got 11 8 11 7 John If acceleration does matter couldn t you also use the equation v t Because I also did that and I got the same D equals one Write it on the board please D equals What s d I know it works I just don t know how it works I m going to tell you in a second One half v average times t So why will this also work then Let s get some of your thoughts Ann Because if it s the average then it s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just Wait a minute It s the average velocity and really the equation is the quantity vo plus v times t Yeah that s what I wrote down Right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity So wait a minute If the equation is vo plus v Then you just get rid of the No Yeah you do v plus vo times t the quantity vo plus v Times t would just be v average times t Okay let s write the whole equation out John one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t Then isn t vo plus v just v average So t equals v average times t Not v average No Yes But vo plus v divided by 2 Oh okay I m sorry I see what you mean I missed that Yes sorry But it can t just be final velocity Okay Is there another equation we could ve used I saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked Anybody in this class have one of the other ones Jonah did you You could do V squared equals 2 a x So another way v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x right Good job so you can see there s multiple ways of getting at the same answer right And D letter D I ll have Gretchen lead Letter D is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time So what equation would you use Sam Would it be kinetic energy equals times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared Yes And then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was 1 67 x 10 27 kilograms Thank you for using the unit And then we found the velocity in letter Given Or it was given right So 1 2 x 10 to the 6th Meters per second Thank you Squared And then you can just plug that into your calculator Sig figs 1 2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second Meters squared over seconds squared Don t forget you have to square the units Kilogram meters squared over seconds squared Kilograms meters squared over seconds squared Yeah What is kilogram meters per second You have to convert the meters I could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something Oh momentum That s not what we re looking for though right No it s not No we re good Okay now Better understanding Yes You gotta stay on top of stuff You can t let those distractions get to you Okay Pass your quizzes to the front face down I ll put them in your files for you Do you want to see I ll take yours separate Are we allowed to retake them Pardon me Can we retake them Sure Thank you You gave me a minus six Well I had everything Okay now we are starting the next chapter today so I have some handouts to give to you Do we have till this Friday to retake the last test Yeah and quarter ends on Friday so anything you guys need 
 Love the many questions that you re asking Asking questions is a great way especially if you re wondering something Feel free to ask it even if you go in a little bit different direction Also the more you reference the book you can give us some things going on in Brave New World and the more specific you can be the better that helps us understand somebody actually connected to the book and maybe how it s connected to them So two things to be thinking about But if you give examples the more specific you can of real world examples also the better off You guys are doing a fantastic job though Talking having a natural conversation letting each other speak and all that So continue with the next question Are we doing that on here What s that Are we doing what we re supposed to in here Yeah and my outside people ya ll are doing fine continue with whatever you want to put on here As long as it s related to the conversation obviously Ya ll want to talk about Bernard John now Yeah Absolutely Alright how do these characters show a variety of ideas about individualism and conformity I ll just kind of start out Here s my answer I kind of said that they were like the Russians who wanted their blue jeans They knew what they wanted and they kinda went for it And in the end society pretty much pushed them back into their place And was like No don t stand up and rise up against us Well I would say I see a similarity between like Bernard and John because they both had individual ideals but I definitely that John was a lot stronger in his beliefs than Bernard was because I think about how Bernard had at first he was all individual and he had these individual beliefs and then when he when they got in trouble kind of in a way all three of them with the uprising and all that kind of stuff He kind of went back on what he was saying And John he stuck to it like he actually did something about it When he actually kind of protested and he was able to go back to being an individual And he went into doing his own thing with his own beliefs So I just feel like John was a lot stronger in what he believed throughout it than Bernard who was kind of allowing people to look at him put on him worried about what other people thought about him and all that kind of stuff That s true Cuz like whenever Bernard was more of I guess a weirdo he does always like question society and why everybody acts the way they do But as soon as he started being popular he started bragging to Helmholtz about how like right here it says And I had six girls last week one on Monday two on Tuesday two more on Friday one on Saturday So as soon as he became just like everybody else he started to like it far more and it mattered much to him that people like people did what they did like not explicit relationships and everything So you re right John was stronger than Bernard I don t think John ever conformed he stuck to his beliefs pretty much the whole time Yeah he always stayed an individual like he made sure he didn t conform Was Helmholtz conformist or individualistic Because he did a lot of the same things that you know normal people do but he also read as an idealism at times I think he s somebody who he conformed to what he had to just to get by But at the same time he had his own thoughts and believed what he believed I just don t think he really stood up for what he believed in So we re Yeah I think so It s almost like it s almost like a fair weather friend He did what was best for him to keep him going got hit and suffered trouble I feel like I don t know maybe I m crazy but I thought Helmholtz was like reminds me of this is stereotypical but he kind of reminds me of like an old professor you know He like just like goes to work Helmholtz has like good thoughts about stuff but then he didn t like live the life Wasn t he some sort of He was like a top guy professor A psychologist or something He was a scientist Alright so kind of sticking on that topic What about the books and how they nobody really read how they kind of all of the books related to I guess individuality and the whole world what life was like before was locked up I can say the same John was reading Shakespeare and how Shakespeare is all about like love and tragedy and there s like sorrow and there s also you know the aspect of love with Romeo Juliet And how the people didn t really Helmholtz would his job was reading it to them and he started laughing about it because he was trained not to So I think if people actually read about it you know the feelings and how love is supposed to be Then people wouldn t go along with how their relationships would be because they d wanna maybe wanna experience falling in love with someone or having that one person would cause a lot more problems with that knowledge along with seeing how people how there s tragedy People are becoming sad and how in the New World people are always supposed to be happy and everyone s getting along Then in these stories there s like love conflict and everyone is fighting and it would cause problems because from that people could form their own individual problems and then they start to have their own individuality and form opinions and start asking questions which leads to a lot of things Books are they pretty much written to express those emotions in which the whole state is trying to block up anyways That was why they re there So the book do you think that the books are kind of what drove Bernard to be a nonconformist and then as he got away from reading and he started conforming back into society What I think happened cuz they were saying I think he was like bipolar or something and everyone else was like something He was shorter than everyone else and I think he was already kind of like put aside cause they were saying that they think he had alcohol given to him as he was a baby so that made him weird So all along he wasn t like everyone else So he wasn t a like no one accepted him for who he was but whenever he got famous or whatever people began to accept him Huh He wasn t able to conform is that what you re saying Yeah I don t think he was able to conform because no one accepted him for who he was except for Helmholtz I think if someone else was in his position like read even like saw a book they probably wouldn t even try to read the way he did They were so used to not I don t know not having books I don t think the same thing would happen to somebody else It kind of reminds me of I don t know if you guys have seen the movie The Book of Eli How the entire time he s trying to hide the Bible because that one guy wants the Bible because he wants control over everybody Because like if he has like everything in the Bible he could like tell people certain things and they would just listen to him so he could be a master Like in this book how everybody like the Controllers just want control over everybody and without books like I think it s just another type of their control That s a good example Also if you think about it present day a lot of people don t even read books anymore They mostly know that they can and you can watch the movies instead There is also technology where you can learn about something without even actually having to read the book So do you think in a way that s kind of like the same way of eliminating how they did in the story and how they eliminate books and there s more technology is like a weakness Today you know we re all about technology so we eliminate more books and there s more movies and more technology Real quick I wanna throw in one scene that I want you guys to think about also You just brought up a point about if people in the world today saw these books would they even know what to do with them What would they think about them We do have a point in Brave New World where someone does see a book that isn t used to seeing these type of books and responds to it When Helmholtz looks at the Shakespeare that John has So what did you make of Helmholtz s response to Shakespeare And what do you think that maybe suggests about people s attitudes in the World State Especially since the Helmholtz would represent I guess an enlightened view point in the World State You remember the scene that I m talking about Yeah Yeah he started off by laughing at it and didn t later on in the scene he kind of hid the fact that he had read it and that he knew what was going on I m just wondering where it all It s page 183 Page 184 says the second paragraph like third or fourth line Helmholtz said listen to the scenes of the world first meeting with a puzzled interest I mean I guess being the enlightened thinker Helmholtz is kinda curious about it and wanted to know more But at the same time he had that conformity which was kinda scaring him away from it Cuz he didn t want to get in trouble I guess He doesn t really seem to understand what s going on in Romeo Juliet because at the bottom of page 184 same page we saw him laughing about it because he didn t understand why the mother and father are trying to force the daughter on someone she didn t want So I mean it just kind of shows how different things were I guess that goes back to the differences in society between then and now For now and the future Like to do the last comments about John or Bernard comparing and contrasting I come up with something that didn t really get mentioned John the reason he s an individual is cause he was born he was like literally born and grew up on the reservation Bernard the reason he s an individual is because of his physical stature So Bernard is an individual because of physically but John is different because of who he is He was born like that so that s what makes they re two different people in individuality standard And that s why I thought that Bernard was so easy to go back to conformity because the only thing that made him different was his height And that s why John couldn t because of who he was I thought Bernard was the person that John would be if John had been born and raised in his World State where Bernard had The only thing that made John different is that he spent so much time on the reservation where everyone s different They value individuality You had some good ideas just to kind of wrap up with that last question Something to think about also you guys kind of hit it on this essentially what we have is two characters in Bernard and John that both do not fit into their communities Right And the world is saying everything is designed to fit exactly and if you don t fit then you re removed from that situation And the Savage Reservation you are basically shamed out of that group Now that s the way John he s trying to interact but because of his mother and because of his birth he is shamed out of it But notice whenever John goes to the World State and Bernard takes him and becomes a celebrity because of it All the sudden Bernard is very happy to be part of the World State So once Bernard can actually conform and gain advantage from that type of society he s more than happy to continue on in it John though being the way he is he s never had the opportunity to conform to any kind of society and he still has that shame culture inside of him that he continues to live by the whole time he s in the World State right So that s something to think about too is not only are they isolated when they are born and different Then what happens when all the sudden one of them can conform and can be a valued member of that society which John sort of is but it s more for him being strange and weird and exotic then it is him being a person and being brought into it Guys that was a great first half What I need you guys to do in the center circle is go ahead and log in to your computers Outside circle people jot down any last minute ideas you want on your paper responses And then in just a minute we ll switch So now we re taking notes as well as having the competition on there Correct and did that go ok for outside folks Yeah It was ok to do both We can still take notes while we re on the inner circle right Oh sure absolutely 
 About 33 33 so 150 plus 33 180 What d you get 180 180 so is that Did we double Went a little higher Went a little higher So you guys made a good prediction didn t you All right keep doing your trials nice work Heads up Madison Heads up Ah Can you stop it No you re good All right so what have you guys found out so far We ve been increasing but then we just It increased a little but I think we re gonna increase a little more Okay so you re measuring You ve all you ve raised your ramp to 10 Yes All right All right Now what was your prediction It would go farther based on height Because like from all the other experiments that we ve done Uh huh It s gone farther so And it has more force if the ramp is higher Okay Man that ambulance that thing moves All right what did you guys get Mary Robin when you measured We got 179 179 okay What was weird is that Like what s weird is that on the first trial we got 130 and then we went to like the like 50s and things Okay And then we went back to like the 80s and 90s Yeah All right so now we need to go ahead and do what You ve done your three trials what s the next Average Average All right let s see We got 182 172 and 179 533 533 and then what are you going to do Divide it by three Okay divide by three 177 666667 So we can round that up to To 178 178 Is that pretty close So you got Your trials are pretty close together 182 172 and 179 So you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp Was that true Yes So your prediction came true Let s turn over the back side and let s finish the rest of that lab part So were there any trials that your team did not record We only did it We didn t do that one because it flipped off It like hit this chip card and it just like went whoo It went like All right that s a good one not to include Let s write that down We didn t include one because it hit a chip hard Yeah Yeah that s good It just like flew off to the side and it went all the way like Did it really Yeah it just That s crazy It was funny because It was also funny because it was going straight but then it just That s weird Turned That s weird that it hit that That that caused it to you know make such a turn But then like The whole time it s been going to the the right side Oh okay So it s been curving Yeah it kind of like tilted and That s a good idea Yeah that s a real good idea Okay so question two What was the average distance the Jeep rolled with the five centimeter height So the five centimeter height On the back side of that We got an average of 30 93 93 all right so write that one down 93 Did that surprise you it would go 93 Yeah Yeah Is that farther that s what you thought I never thought we d actually get to the end of it Yeah that s a But then we actually did with those little toy cars Yeah And this is actually an older looking toy car Yeah Because whenever I roll one wheel the other wheel rolls just a little Oh yeah Okay So you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it Yeah Okay But I never thought it would actually go that far Okay So you re now on number three right What was the average distance the Jeep rolled 10 centimeter height That was 178 Okay So 178 It looks like the next question is did the Jeep roll shorter or longer distance Longer Longer Can we figure out how much farther Yes What would we have to do The 10 centimeter average minus the 5 centimeter average and then your answer would be how Like the distance between Well why don t you do that Why don t you pull that up The 178 You know it s always better when you can incorporate those into your answers You know it increased by one Or it was 85 higher It s always better when you can show your answer with data When you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid right All right so maybe can include that and then move on to that number five there Okay All right You guys are doing a great job Hey have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side Did you read all these first You gotta read this whole section of your lab first okay Yeah so I would read this part first and then move on okay All right All right how you guys doing Good All right so you guys have done your first trial on this one Now did you do this one here I don t Let s look at our directions It says change the ramp back to five centimeters high Did you do that No sir Okay let s do that All right Sandpaper And then I think it Doesn t it say It says tile floor It says tile floor so we re going to measure on the tile I get to race it All right are we ready Now I m going to move over here Now what vehicle we got here You should move over there because it always goes over here Oh it always moves over here Yeah It has a curve Yeah How about if I move back over here Will that work All right you ready Right here Yeah that s good Oh you re right Good thing I moved I ll hold it down Hold that down Now in your first experiment Annie while they re doing this what did it When you increased the height of the ramp did it increase Yeah it went faster It went what It went faster because it had more force Okay so it had more force So why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab it had more force All right It s more steeper Okay And the more steeper it is the more less friction it would cause so it could go faster Okay What was the force that was bringing it down the ramp Gravity Gravity So you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp the pull of gravity is greater Yeah because it s going more Okay all right It s going down going faster Okay And then when it gets if it gets down safely it ll just go farther because it has more speed Okay Great All right so we re on trial two aren t we Yes Let s do it Go You do have that it does have that curved roll Oh it landed on the On the back of it There s like a cargo of some sort in the back of it Is it is there a There s cargo in the 113 Wait wait hold on Let s double check What I would do maybe is bring your Jeep over Yeah but then it s 106 No but then it s Oh you re on the Are you going to the front Yeah Okay 113 yeah you re right No but then you re going at an angle And you don t let it go Yeah I mean either way I think you re going to get a As long as you That s the way we re doing it from here Well you know as long as you do the same thing every time then you should be consistent right Yeah All right one more roll right One more And then we have it yeah One more roll Jordan Here we go Then we have to add them all up Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun Dun dun dun dun dun The only thing is that Is that farther Don t you think it s farther Are we ready Maybe it s because of me Do you think you have anything to do with it Yeah You do huh Go Fire 117 How far 117 117 all right 117 So now wait Now Thiago the math whiz has to do his math All right so how do you find the average again We do We do We add them all up and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it Okay let s do it So we rolled it three times You ready Let s find our average Pencil please Oh you guys aren t even using a calculator No we haven t been We only use it for the division Oh you only use it for the division Hey I like that Sometimes sometimes Sometimes we still need it What do you guys got 10 That s zero 10 To zero add up the Four and three So 340 So you re going to take 340 and then you re going to divide it Divided by three And Thiago can usually do that You get 113 3333333 All right well check it out on a calculator just to make sure Okay How can you do that in your head without a calculator I don t know Yeah but how do you do that What did you say the number was Thiago It was 113 33333 All right here we go It s 113 come on Thiago 113 333333333 He got it All right nice job man All right so 113 Is that pretty consistent though Yeah Yeah because we had a 113 Yeah you did And that was your middle score wasn t it Yeah And really if you take the thing And then we gotta do this one No never mind I think if you take four here and you put it here Yeah if you take three here put it here then you have one more here Yep All right So now what we re going to do it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp Which we did And predict whether it s going to go We ll have to redo those won t we Yeah So let s erase those because you had the ramp at how high 10 centimeters 10 and we needed to We need to have an equal trial We need to have it at the same distance right Yeah So the question is Sit up for me Jordan I know we got a lot of space here What are we going to Do you think it s gonna go shorter or a farther distance It s gonna go shorter Why Because there s more friction Sandpaper s rough so it creates more friction Okay Slow down the thing Okay what do you think When it slows it down it may slow it down and then it says the car starts to turn just because Just because it s our car goes out to the side so it goes more to the side All right Than it usually does What do you guys think Farther or shorter I think it ll go shorter because The gravity may be pulling it down but the sandpaper is really rough like Thiago said and it would like stop it to make it not move anymore It would like barely get off the paper Okay can you guys like Say you re riding your bike And you ride your bike on smooth pavement and then you ride it on a rough surface Is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough Smooth The smooth right So can we use that to help us make our prediction It actually could be faster on the bumps more because if you hit a bump If you re going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump you could actually go in the air Okay maybe All right let s go and test this thing out and see if you guys are right Annie while we re setting up this lab can you go ahead and write your prediction And it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there Now I can t sit here can I This is the bad seat I gotta move Well I say you sit It doesn t go very far anymore on the sandpaper All right well let s set it up there That one there right And that one there Four centimeters more All right let s look We went 113 With the sandpaper how far do you think it s gonna go Let s make a prediction I think it ll go maybe half that or even less than half that Okay so what would half of 113 be What s that close to I don t know I think that would be maybe 500 500 and No you want half of it Oh five okay Half of it 50 I think there you go 50 yeah 50 All right 52 51 point 50 point like Okay All right are we ready for the first roll Let s do it Let s get our first trial Here we go We re ready Wait who hasn t rolled Has Emma not rolled Okay all right good I like the way your group s working together there All right Here we go Oh Should we use that trial or should we try a different one Try again Let s try one more Maybe we can get that Well scoot it right over here And we could even scoot the sandpaper like there Yeah All right you ready All right there it is It didn t even move off the sandpaper Let s give it Can someone hold that down Can someone hold that down please Here we go This is our test Is the prediction right The sandpaper s hard It is it s rough isn t it Yeah 49 Now aren t you on the front Yeah which would be a 49 Yeah but you mean Or maybe you re about 50 Yeah about 50 You guys were pretty close in your prediction weren t you Half It was like 50 Yeah Jordan said 50 1 2 All right you guys got two more trials right I said 51 1 2 You said 51 1 2 All right ready Yeah Oh man Really Let s like keep it down Or maybe we ll hold it down next time yeah Yeah I think that s the problem It s scooting back That was 50 47 Yeah 47 Okay Almost in half All right I ll hold it on this side Are we ready Here we go 
 Think out loud what are we doing OK you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to How do we do that Take 196 divide it by four Hold on let me hear from somebody that I haven t heard from Need to find the square root of 196 OK why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four Because all sides are equal Well if all sides were equal that s why we would divide by four Because to find the area of the square you have to square it So the opposite of squaring is square root So we would divide by four if we were given the perimeter If we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four But we were given the area so we need to square root 14 OK so the side lengths are 14 Multiply times 4 It s 56 Anybody see a problem with this OK so this side is on the inside of the figure So it doesn t count so instead of doing 14 times 4 We do 14 times 3 How do we find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi R divided by 2 2 pi R divided by 2 How do you find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi R divided by 2 So the radius that means 7 7 is 14 2 times pi times 7 So that should be 2 times 3 14 So the whole thing is 53 38 So then 2 pi R divided by 2 I got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14 So 14 divided by 2 is 7 Here Skye can you take this Thank you Put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem C squared OK all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal How many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure Don t you got to work it into two rectangles I think it d be easier of you did it the long way Does it matter which way you split it Either way you re going to have to split something right You can determine either of the missing sides In order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply 7 times 6 is 42 Where is I don t see a 7 in my problem OK but what does 7 represent I don t see a 7 what is It represents the length of this What length From the line on down to 6 OK Could you label that with a 7 Cause I still don t see 7 It said how many one inch squares OK so you want to multiply what by 12 87 87 times 12 Why But you made the 12 into a 7 OK so you want to do Where are you all getting 12 from A foot is 12 inches There s one inch not twelve Oh because I found the 87 feet squared I found the area of it but then you ve got to find how many 1 inch so you multiply it times 12 because there s 12 inches in a foot So what are we multiplying with 12 So we re doing 87 times 12 Shouldn t you divide though Try dividing What do you get when you divide Say that again In one square foot there are 144 inches Instead of going by 12 which I said originally shouldn t we be doing it by 144 Since one square foot is how many inches it is But I ve got 87 square foot But I m saying in each foot there s 144 inches So instead of 12 there are 144 square inches So instead of multiplying by now that I think about it we should multiply it by 144 OK let me ask you guys this what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area Could we do it that way Yeah OK let s try it that way What would 9 be in inches 9 feet in inches 108 108 What would 5 be in inches 7 in inches 7 feet 84 84 thank you Kashmir And 6 72 72 thank you Sierra OK we know what all our units are in inches Now when we find the area we re going to be finding square inches Somebody want to take over from here Skye do you mind if you continue writing Uhm yeah No I don t mind Thank you You can erase all of it My eraser got stolen So do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width right Yeah It s what 6 480 It s multiplying But that s wrong though Don t you still have to subtract I mean like 84 minus 60 because they re part of the No we didn t convert the 12 We converted the 7 Oh OK So it s still already changed Good question though What s the total 12 528 I just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct You are supposed to multiply by 144 Good job What did you say it was 12 528 How d you get that OK Next problem No You have a question Yes When you get 1000 When did you have 1 044 Oh and then you multiply by 12 again Because guess what 12 times 12 is 144 So that s what you re doing You re multiplying by into 12 and 12 right They way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15 From the very very top to the very bottom Thank you because now we know that that s 1 inch Can t you break it up Now that we know the basic triangle in the back That means you re breaking it up into a triangle and a square Yes The square on the bottom I m sorry Jacob The base of what The base of the triangle in the back But what s the base 5 The height is 5 and the base is 15 Well yeah but I was asking Jacob what the base of the triangle was Can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18 Because the width of the rectangle is 10 and I have to add the sides of the triangle 
 Five four three two one stop I m going to follow the same norms you are so if I want to talk I m going to have to raise my hand Does anybody want to start us off Sort of an initial response or something that s been on your mind or a place we can go in the play to start this conversation In the last act when Emilia and Iago or Iago s been caught and Emilia is piecing together all of these things that Iago s done how it all works and she s telling the others around him what he s done he keeps telling her Be quiet this isn t your place to talk you shouldn t be here But whereas most stereotypical women would have just kind of followed what their husband wanted and just you know kind of been in the background Emilia actually stands up and says what she thinks is right Yeah okay What also talked about was how Desdemona kind of juxtaposes that in that she s like the very stereotypical housewife to the point at which she refuses to even like blame her husband for killing her so we kind of it s interesting how those two characters are just To touch on the racism part I would have to say it s not and at least if it is that isn t the main focus of the play I d say that it s focused more on these complex characters and their web of lies and the plot itself isn t focused on if it is I think because I don t really think it is I kind of agree with Chloe I don t think that Othello is a racist or sexist play It does have racism and sexism in it but that s because it was written by William Shakespeare in a time when that was the norm You can t really look at it as a modern person because we think of racism and sexism so differently from the audience it was intended for They thought of it as more of the norm so it does seem more normal Like it seemed believable and normal to them because that s just how their society was Then it also kind of looks at like how racism sort of caused it like Iago hates Othello and one reason that he gives is that he s black and he doesn t deserve his position and he kind of uses race to his advantage to do bad things So it s kind of looking at it s not racist it s looking at racism and sexism and saying like how they can be used and manipulated you know Yeah I kind of agree with you I think this play is really about like taking advantage of people any way you can So like if you have something on them like they re a different color or if they re a different sex then you can use that to your advantage by like putting that as an excuse almost to take advantage Let s return to that Raise your hand if Iago was your favorite character in this class Come on I mean this is a I have to say I agree I would raise my hand to that question which I find troubling because I certainly agree with some of the opinions that I m hearing here that we have this interesting contrast between Emilia and Desdemona as two different ways women can live with male violence and we also have this examination of how racism and sexism are used as part of the plot to take down Othello But at the same time I have to say I think that it feels to me like the play is set up for us like Iago more Iago talks to us he lets us into his world into his mind in a way that nobody else does So I d almost feel like we can t blame ourselves as the audience for identifying with him for secretly making part of us rooting for him or he even made me sort like glorying in his intelligence and his capacity for manipulation and just his power And I wonder what we do with that because if you walk away from this play being like I love Iago Then aren t you also kind of saying in a way celebrating what he s done Do you agree with me Disagree with me I think his ability to like his like logic and how he like plans things like how he like manipulates a lot of situations and how he like schemes to like use people s like baggage I guess to his advantage is kind of like I guess like the way he uses it isn t a good way but like if you could use it in a different way I guess it like could be viewed as like a good thing So I think there s a difference between like celebrating what he s done and just appreciating like the amount of thought and like intelligence that he has in using it in a bad way because like you can like Iago and like him for different reasons than Oh I like what he s done I like how he destroyed this person It can be just you know I realize that this is a very smart person and someone I really would not want to be on his bad side But like you just sort of you realize like how much I guess yeah I ll just use the word appreciate again You just appreciate like how much you understand his mind and it s just really interesting rather than you love him Yeah I think it s more like sometime s it s fun to like root for like the evil character Because you wouldn t actually do it like if you play video games like Grand Theft Auto Like you kill the hookers it s not like you would have to do that it s just that it s fun Oh my God Well it doesn t surprise me that Iago s the one that most people come away from the play with being like Yeah he s so great he s so interesting right Because like he s the only character that you actually get to know Everyone else just kind of like dies They get drunk and like stab people or they cry That s pretty much what everybody else does and then Iago s the one who like lets you in lets you know what he s thinking when he s bringing specific elements like with each person in the play he s different from each person and you can see that through the play Well as she was saying like how everyone else was crying and like going crazy or like either having an awful time or having a good time like they still trust Iago even though he s standing there not doing that with them I mean just like the way he s able to still convince them whenever he s not he doesn t seem like he s on the like he convinced them that he s on their side but he s not actually doing everything they are or he s not really doing anything to show them that s he s isn t feeling what they re feeling Alex I have a quote I guess It s at around there And their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it they do when they change us for others Is it sport I think it is And doth affection breed it I think it doth Is t frailty that thus errs It is so too And have we not affections desires for sport and frailty as men have Then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so So it s kind of like talking about how the men control the women and so I guess like that s like the sexism of the day or like of that era and like this is Emilia she s talking to Desdemona and she s talking about how like men control them and all their thoughts are kind of implanted by the men like Emilia like she got the handkerchief because her husband told her to do that and they re all just really obedient and everything Chloe I mean I think that yeah it has to do with the time period as far as the sexism in the play or whatever but I mean because that it s just the way it was but I think that when you look at the female characters in the play like Emilia she turns out to be one of the most influential characters and she s the one that takes down the bad person It s her that takes down Iago pretty much because she tells him the truth and then something that none of the men could do or even question Then the other thing I would say is that the women s loyalty to each other especially Desdemona to Emilia because it s back earlier in the play I don t actually have it but Emilia I mean Desdemona sings a song earlier in the play something Willow willow willow some more stuff about the song and then when Emilia s dying she sings a line from that exact same song and she says she references my mistress death So I think a lot of it shows how the women stick together It s also kind of like I mean I agree with you and I mean it s not sexist it looks at sexism because I mean you see how Desdemona is the stereotypical woman of that time and she kind of does what her husband tells her to she doesn t rebel against him she is completely loyal to him regardless of how he treats her I mean he s hit her and she just accepts it Even when he kills her she takes the blame and doesn t rat him out and it just kind of you have problems respecting her because of it Like I mean she s a good character but you just can t it s really hard to respect someone who just accepts everything that is done to her like that Then you have to juxtapose it with Emilia and she was a really influential character and is able to rise above and kind of try to take down her own husband and go against it It s kind of looking at sexism and saying like you know which is better for you Which do you like more Look at how the sexism and the roles of women has affected Desdemona and then how Emilia s been able to rise above it Can I jump in Yeah I definitely agree with you but my thoughts are also going back to Act I Scene III because I think at the beginning of the play Desdemona is very much not a stereotypical woman She has married the man she loves defying her father Knowing her dad wouldn t like it she ran off and married him anyway When Othello s talking about how he won her heart it was by telling the stories of the wars and it s actually very interesting because it says that Desdemona would seriously She would be very interested in these stories even to the point where she wished she had been born a man Then when Othello says I have to go to war and the Duke says Let s like Desdemona stay at her dad s house Desdemona says No I married this man to be with him Let me go to the war also So at least at that scene I think that she s a model of a very very active woman who wants to go to war with her husband she wants to be with her husband When Othello comes out in Act II Scene III to stop the fight between Cassio and Roderigo Desdemona comes out too and says What s going on what s wrong And Othello says Come away sweetie let s go back to bed Right I certainly agree that there s a passivity in Desdemona by the end but I don t know if I see that so much at the beginning Go ahead I agree I think that like sometimes Desdemona wants to be the stereotypical woman and then like other times she wants to be the like rebel kind of because like Mr Proctor said like she completely rebels against her dad at the beginning and then also like she s not the stereotypical woman because like every single man like in the play has admitted that she s the most beautiful woman that they want her and all this stuff and so she has some power over them too But yeah I just think it s interesting how like there are scenes where she s the complete like stereotypical housewoman and then other times she s like completely passive Even though it s been brought up that she defied her father to marry Othello she s still I feel like she s still very like part of that time period as far as the role of women because even though Othello wasn t her perfect husband in the eyes of her father she still jumped from the control of one man her father to another man her husband So Tanya Okay so about Desdemona I think that like even though she did that stuff she still was a stereotypical woman Like we said before those women they re supposed to be obedient to their husbands so like whenever she does kind of like rebel and do something different from or like kind of jump in to the conver like Mr Proctor was saying like those examples she s doing it for Othello She jumps in like she goes to war to be with him and then she comes in like whenever he s in trouble And then the thing about Emilia is she s doing stuff for herself Like in Act IV Scene III yeah that s what we read she s talking about how it s just like she would cheat on her husband once It s just like she says The world s a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice 
 Can someone come up and put number one on the graph And then we re going to debate about it Anassia can you come up and show us where you think one should be Alright so what I think is I don t know if I m right or wrong or whatever but I thought kinda one is there Do you guys see it No OK back can you give us a reason why OK well it says David had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant so I kinda think that from home the restaurant must be close that s why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card We don t know if he has money on him ya know It could depend on circumstances but I think that the restaurant was hella close that s why he went back and went back home OK wait wait wait Wait wait wait wait OK So honestly who has that opinion So you think one is at the very beginning Mmmhmmm of his trip OK can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place Anassia can you pick someone Overwhelming You I put it right here Right there Right there OK can you give us a reason He s driving and then he goes to the restaurant and then he s driving away No This is the restaurant right here and then he s leaving and he s like Oh snap I left my credit card Then he goes back and then he s driving away That s it OK wait so whose idea do we agree with Sidius or Anassia Sidius OK but we still have to convince Anassia because she still thinks it s at the beginning right I thought it was at the beginning too You did Who convinced you Myself Yourself OK so if David is driving back to the restaurant then should his slope be what What should his slope be Negative If he s going back to the restaurant Right because if I m travelling this way my slope s getting bigger my distance is getting farther But wait I turn back so my slope has to be Negative Negative So do you think one is when the slope gets negative Yeah So are you convinced now Anasstia That it has to be negative for him to go back Yeah So are we OK with erasing that first one Well I have to erase all of it anyway Oh OK sorry OK So one should be where he s going back right where he s going negative OK Alright Is there a real end to it Well we re going to see once we get through them Alright So Sidi can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be No hands I would put two here Can you explain why Candy Wait just give us an explanation Yeah because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative He went back Close to his house Yeah near his house but then it s near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero Because the line there represents the distance from his home right I ve got a question OK You know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house We re looking at his car not looking at the tow away car aren t we So wouldn t it be considered constant since his car is moving So I guess the car is on the tow truck right So now wherever the tow truck goes the car has to go right Yeah Does anyone have a different place for number two No So we all agree that two no do you want to put two in a different place Put it in a different place Let s see what you think Put it in a different place let s see what you think Go I was thinking of putting it right here That s what I was thinking That s what I thought too Can you explain why Why Because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house So I was thinking that the first sentence so his car broke down So if he was not going anywhere then the time was going then constant so if as you see the time his speed never changes while the time is just going down That s what I think That s wrong We don t say that s wrong we say Well I disagree Well So convince him otherwise Because the car is still moving and if you look really really closer at the graph the last point isn t directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero Also if it was constant that means he would just be in one spot but it s clearly saying that he s being towed back towards the repair shop so he s in motion like the slope is showing distance and not speed Well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere So can I say two things One thing so it s a different interpretation of this problem right So if he was broken down and the car was just staying there then would this be a good place for two Yes If the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing It s not changing right Because time is going on but distance is staying the same However number two says he s going to the repair shop close to his house So is he just staying in one place No right So he s gonna go back home so if he s going back home so this slope would be negative or positive Negative Negative And it s going here s home right So where does he go back home Or very close to home Here right Are you convinced Danny Yes OK let s erase the other number two But Danny thank you for being brave because I could understand that interpretation Alright Danny can you pick someone to put number three on the graph OK number three is over here I disagree Wait wait We haven t even heard her explanation Wendy what s your explanation why Because it s stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it s kinda constant here so it can be stopped So why not the long one Because he s in the restaurant I suppose But then So if one is here if one is here it has to be in the restaurant then right Well then one is over there so then why would three be all the way over there One is here right No no no One is all the way at the beginning No Sorry that s Y But then it says that he got a three Yes but it s here Yeah he ate there so wouldn t that be the one Like wouldn t that be where he gets his gas Number three said that he went to eat but it doesn t say where did he eat Maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about Yeah maybe he went a bit farther and said OK let me go somewhere else so that s why So what did he do here Eat and gas It doesn t take that long to eat One hour People take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can t just eat while they re getting gas Oh let me eat while I m getting gas OK so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station The restaurant The restaurant So do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time Short Shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is right So we haven t gotten to the restaurant yet have we No No OK So could three be the place where he stops and gets gas Could it be Possibly We don t know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour Or maybe it meant five minutes Yeah you know you never know So if we interpreted five minutes gas and quick bite quick sandwich Could we put three at that place Yes Why Because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time I think that at three he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card Maybe the gas station is near the restaurant Why you make this so difficult That s possible though right I m like thinking of putting at the beginning Here Here is four Wait wait wait Don t go on four yet But I think the three should be before one Because you can t just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich OK we re going to do this because I like the debate you re having but I want groups to think about it individually and then we re going to come back but I want to put one thing for sure on the board OK so If if if if If If this is definitely Let s say this is definitely where David stopped to eat OK so this is where David is eating Eating as in in the restaurant Eating at the restaurant yes So here David is eating for a long time at the restaurant OK A long long time So that s the longest is this the longest time where the slope is flat Yeah So we re all gonna agree right now that this is where David is eating at the restaurant So this is where David is eating at the restaurant can you put all the other numbers in a logical place Because I hear you guys talking about logic Like he can t go to the gas station before he does what Goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card OK so I see that s one logical statement so in your groups I m gonna give you five minutes for this Can you put one two three and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it OK 
 Take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you re going to be working on And this we want to remind you that it s kind of dinner party conversation ish You agree with people at dinner parties You disagree with people at dinner parties but it s civil because it s friends that you invited over to your house You don t raise your you don t raise your hand at dinner parties You wait until you wait until You wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking of course because that s polite dinner conversation You add on to what one another says But like I said we don t necessarily have to agree And then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party somebody else brings something else up So you can raise your own questions as well So the seminar is open and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of The Veldt What did it mean like George having like I think that I know a lot of times where he especially in the towards the back he it goes back a little ways He s like talking a lot of things like comments turning comment commen I can t say that word He says they re going to turn the house down possibly for a month and how he pick out the picture painter And he was telling his he was like talking to his son a lot and like about not about doing what his son would not want to have happen and how he spoiled his children so much So he takes out there s a lot of things that his son his son and daughter it just doesn t say as much wouldn t like because yeah But he wasn t like he wasn t like I agree that Oh yeah I m gonna go die today I agree that it was He didn t want to die I agree that it was Of course he didn t want to die Who wants to die Except for if you re suici you know suicidal I agree that and on Page 15 where it says um it s mostly on 16 but starts on Page 15 Won t this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children s affections It assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents and now you want to come along and shut it off Kind of shows why that they hate them And because it because it s since the nursery is their parents it s like some guy who thinks he can tell you coming along and can tell you to kill your parents you know It s the same thing as they re doing though They re killing their parents Well But they think the nursery is their parents they don t think their parents are their parents They don t matter as much as parents If they d been nice to them and now they re going to turn everything off then isn t it imbalanced So now they re relying on the house because that s what they ve learned to do as Yeah It d be like take an example people are killing their parents And on Page 15 it says like I also think that it s the dad says I sen The psychologist says I sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now you re letting them die in some way So if they like they don t really know like when someone says no to them they ve been spoiled so much they don t even like well they just can t take it It makes them go all crazy and stuff So they wanted to kill them because they like couldn t fly to New York so Yeah Because I think And if their parents and if their parents and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents then maybe not But since their parents don t really take care of them it s the house that takes care of them Yeah And then the The house and the room replaced their parents Yeah Their parents and friends It s not like the parents could They don t have friends because they re the room they get all these adventures because of the room Yeah They don t have friends And they kind of like rely on the house to give them stuff all the time If the house refused them if it could then I don t think that they would want to kill it I think that it s just because they don t feel like their parents are actually their they don t they feel their parents aren t important to them So when they say no On page on page 13 the mom s saying That sounds stressful Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it And brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath The kid s like now relying on everything He s never had to do something for himself So he doesn t really like know Yeah He s gotten so like stuck on having everyone do things for him he thinks like doing your own thing would be like A challenge Yeah Like and I guess you can use an example as Wall E a show People get like so fat and they rely on everything so much that like they have to move in chairs and they when you golf it s virtual golf there s a robot for you So they just they take robotics and machines to the next level and they it s all they rely on And so many people don t have to work Yeah and weren t the ones that like bought the house that they were actually the cause because they were the ones like on Page 5 and 11 they even said that We were the ones who bought the house We were the ones who got us into this mess So but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children which made them mad So again they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house I think it Like don t you think that people would be sort of obese like Elliot said Yeah They would be They would be Yeah but then they d be like everyone else in the world But then they also Yeah and Getting exercise But they re obese And also I think that it s George Hadley s fault not necessarily both the parents because the mom didn t really do as much Because like well the quote over there it said that like she s the one who let them in for a minute But She just wanted to be nice She just wanted to be nice But I think like on Page two it says But nothing s too good for our children George said So I don t think it s as much Lydia s fault because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there She just wanted to be nice to the kids because George had shut it off so abruptly But I think it s more George s fault that they spoiled them and that therefore gets himself killed Does anyone know when this story was written Because I m guessing it was 1950 All right Because I was I m guessing it was wri I was guessing it was written when women weren t like thought of that highly Because Wendy only actually speaks once and is a sniveling idiot most of the time And Lydia s and Lydia Hadley is pretty passive And it s the guys that are have all the action and have anything really going on Except in the final scene Well yeah But that she on She says one line One line in the whole book basically I know but Lydia sort of has a bit of action Yeah but She doesn t do much She doesn t like She s pretty passive She doesn t like um disagree with her husband or her kids She doesn t do anything like that She just follows whatever her husband says Maybe she has a few opinions but not really And Wendy says four words alone in the whole thing so Well I mean you hear her screaming but other than that Is that a word Well that was Unless she s saying it Close enough at the same time as Peter like when they both come in and say Hello mom and dad Doesn t really count or when they both say Mommy daddy come quick But she s saying it at the same time She only says four words by herself in the entire story The screams are actually their parents when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being Yeah they realized that at the end but they didn t really make that very clear They re like suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar I thought the whole book or the whole story that it was like the kids screams But it s actually the parents What are Yeah because it s really not clear on that I figured that it s actually so they all Well I m it s more it s nicer to have like a mystery kind of Mm hmm Yeah I figured that it s the author s fault The what The author s But How is it the author s fault Because it s his story Well the author wrote it That doesn t make any sense But Carl the author Yeah that doesn t make much sense It s not his fault It s the it s totally off topic Yeah I agree with Elise When I didn t really get who the screams were until the very end where they said yeah that I think it s on Page um 19 But yeah that they were it says on Page screamed and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar So I thought it was the kids the whole time I thought Aaron was saying something before but then everyone What I was going to say is the a little while ago when I was going to ask you why do people think it s like Peter Hadley or other because I mean The other is both of them Because more or less the majority did George Hadley So why just those people who did that why did they do that I understand with Peter Hadley because it is his he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents But it s not his fault he got spoiled He can t help it if his parents spoiled him Yeah because Actually even if the parents had been played more of a parent role they would still probably have preferred the nursery because You don t need to the parents could still say no and the nursery does they can like do whatever they want with it I agree with the both parents part of it even though the mom wasn t as involved as George was the mother was not do posing a part in the kids life as being the mom and the house was So that caused them to think the house was their parents and the house was their family This is Indirectly directly I think You can go Directly the Peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying Directly Directly But indirect well directly the lions were Oh my God Indirectly but directly it was mostly Peter but indirectly it was it was kind of everybody s fault I kind of agree with like both the parents and then the dad Because in the beginning the parents are like slowly taking away some things like the painter and not letting them go to New York And that kind of builds up their anger But in the end the dad just wants to shut it all off And then the son starts getting really mad and like threatening them finally they like get really mad and then they start imagining the parents dying and then They ve been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing I think it was the parents fault and the inventor Because I mean none of it would have happened if they wouldn t have had the just like the super technology house and the nursery So it s technology s fault It s not the inventor s fault because he didn t know But it s not the it s not the inventor s fault that they thought though If he wouldn t have made it it would have never happened And also if the dad wouldn t have bought it it would never happened too So that s my two opinions They couldn t But they bought it but they made it and bought it to be a good thing not a bad one No one invented it so that you would so that it d be used as a murder machine They didn t just make it like on the advertisement Greatest Murder Machine Ever Perfect for murdering your parents We don t know like why he built it Maybe it was because of that but you don t know like exactly what his point of the invention was It was to like study the children s thoughts It was to study their minds Because the children He said that but what if it s not He s a liar The children were mentally impaired and they needed to be looked up on and they wanted to know what they were thinking so So a psychologist Another good quote to show that it was to show that it might have that it could have been the parents fault was that on Page 11 it said yeah George said Who was it that who was it said Children are carpets They should be stepped on occasionally Because the parents didn t they didn t do anything to the kids They They didn t really step on them that much until the end They just did what they want They just all of a sudden just like flattened them Yeah they just did it so abruptly Yeah they just started and let it go It was just like bam you re dead No wonder they wanted them dead Guys let s try and talk one person at a time or else we can t hear My turn Okay On Page 15 it says that the dad went from Santa Santa to Scrooge And like if he would have taken away like one thing at a time over a period of time I don t think the kids would be like like killing them But it says he just took all the good stuff away at once and they got like really mad That s also kind of dangerous though Because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter So it was they still could ve gotten mad It s also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away because they get more and more mad All the anger I have another opinion that I was trying to say but then I let Fiona go first That s not fair No that s not it s my fault All the anger built up because Anyway um 
 Viewing my art room from the front corner I have a storage area on the right hand side Entry to the art room and paint storage is right by the door Uh a cart for paint supplies that can be wheeled out into the room I have a large white cabinet for all of my paper and on the other side storage for student art work I have a dry erase board a digital white board and a bulletin board for instruction for students in the front of the room We often sit right in the center of the room There s also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in My tables are shaped around there in a U shaped formation each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling Indicating the table there s a red table orange yellow green blue and so forth Each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables In the very back corner is the teacher desk Two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that s hooked up to the digital whiteboard Across the back of the room I have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work and store some ongoing large artworks On the back wall I have more storage metal cabinets rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from And directly below me is our class pet this is where Shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating Like rabbits and dogs dinosaurs And kitty cats And puppies So first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures Listen so that we have time for working I need everyone to put in bubble We are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long long long ago The very oldest art in the whole world Are horses and bulls inside of a cave So the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals About horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them Put hands down put hands down dinosaurs yeah Well that was after the dinosaurs But I m looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here Does anyone recognize some of those animals Yeah Izaiah do you Izaiah Izaiah with a Z Do you want to go up and point Come up and show us some animals that you recognize Only animals who only only Listen She s the teacher right now What s it Kangaroo What else Let her answer Fish and turtle and um crocodile and a duck Yeah and some kind of a bird Good job Did you notice that these are all made with dots That s how some artists who live in Australia Kimberly come right here in front of me Turn around so you can see That s how some artists in Australia make animals And they kind of show what s inside of them don t they It s really good that you notice that Izaiah Do you have a comment I know all those animals Good so you were naming them right along with her Raiden why is your name up your hand up You said last time we have to finish our Oh we do have to finish those you re right We will don t worry Okay Next What kind of animal is that A horse A horse You know what it says at the top It s a horse of a different color Because what color is it Blue Kind of like the Wizard of Oz right there Why boys and girls Why is the horse blue What do you think Why is the horse blue To make the horse beautiful To make it beautiful Why else would it be blue Maybe because it There s another one It s a unicorn horse isn t it What Shhhh what I m curious Izaiah why would an artist make a horse blue Because it might be a unicorn Well it could be Why Because it might be a different kind of animal Yeah it might be a different type of animal horse Have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination And used your favorite colors in it How many people do that sometimes I know I do Sometimes I might make an animal but instead of making him brown maybe I ll make him pink and purple and yellow Ooooooh And make him a little bit more imaginative Sometimes at my dad s house all by myself What else do we have Another horse Here s a fancy prancy horse Now the other horse was kind of looking down but what s this horse doing What s this horse doing Jumping Flying He s walking or galloping isn t he He looks Look how he s standing Look at the two horses If you had to tell me how this horse is feeling Sad Why do we think sad Emma why do you think sad Because he s looking down He is looking down isn t he Maybe he s sad because his family just got killed by another animal Oh I hope that didn t happen He could be sad about something that happened What about this horse Happy Why Melanie why do you think he looks happy Because he still has a family of his own Because why Because he still has a family of his own That s not why That s not why Izaiah you might have a different idea than Melanie Isn t it okay to have a different idea Yeah So I need you sitting Kimberly and Regan you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun Izaiah so it s okay to have what was your idea about why he might be happy Because he s walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals Oh my but that wouldn t be very happy would it You think he looks happy Are there any other words you can think of to describe him He s prancing around Usually if you re in a bad mood do you walk around like this With your head up No I used to do this too That s not prancing that s stomping But prancing is when you have your head up isn t it Kimberly Kimberly Right here Come over here by me Maybe maybe he was doing this because on his arm There s something on his arm Oh it could be like a bandage couldn t it It might just be the way it s painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him Is that what you re noticing What are you noticing but one of my family died Awww That is sad isn t it Really really really old That happens sometimes I m sorry family died in a fire Guess what Guess what Shhhh Kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me Brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom not crawling on the floor You have to color inside of it You might want to draw his shell first to make it really big Look at mine Can I see Good job Make these lines really really dark Hey look at my turtle Go back over it like this Boys and girls if your paper s kind of cause you re pushing so hard then you re drawing dark enough Okay they should really be pressing hard with that Good go over it really really dark That s dark enough It looks great Oh Kimberly yes And put your name on the front with the crayon Well look Izaiah here s two choices for your shell You can start with an oval like that or you can start like this Okay Yeah but I think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle Which one do you like Make it really big Perfect There you go Look at my turtle Boys and girls I want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint Okay Keep darkening your lines Okay darken those lines We have to go and get our paint Boys and girls darken every line and I m going to come around and as soon as I see that yours is nice and dark I ll put the paint on your table Okay This is yours That s good that s good This is dark enough What I want you to trace over is the black parts And see these pencil lines You have to trace over top of them Or the paint will cover them up So what color would you like to use there What color would you like to trace these in Come pick a color Come sit down Tyler start working on your design No start working on your designs in the middle That s perfect Nice and dark Boys and girls see how dark these lines are This is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be You want to go back over it and trace it really dark That one looks good too Nice and dark That s awesome Start drawing I need yellow Boys and girls would you put your name on Pardon the interruption please come to the office please come to the office Put your name right here While you re getting ready to paint put your name on the front in crayon Nice and dark write your name nice and dark with your crayon Well trace over it with the crayon Look at mine As soon as you re sitting down Caitlin I m coming around to look Boys and girls when you re ready you may put your hand up and I ll come around and check your pictures You are ready Yours looks really nice Good He made me draw it for you Very good Melody I m waiting for that hand to go up Isaiah ah That looks great While you re waiting for your paint make those darker Shhhh Darken these a little bit Izaiah what are you doing Oh I like your turtle

 They re coming around They re coming around When you have it You re a Grand Old Flag goes under your seats What Do the Stars Do Put them in your hands William why don t you come sit next to Victoria Do you mind Because then you re a little closer Just move a little closer to Jeffrey Stand Reach Stand up Stand up Big breath Oh my goodness Relax Put your hands here Get a diaphragm breath instead of that kind of a breath Here we go big diaphragm breath Ready Breathe in Remember the beginning of the year when you were doing Ready Breathe in Here we go Let it all out Breathe in diaphragm breath Put your hand here Breathe Again Hiss it all out Breath in And you re going to go Ahhhhhhh ready Here we go Breathe in Start up Breathe in Good low diaphragm Relax your shoulders and ahhhhhhh Breathe in Do you see what you re gonna do Instead of hissing out you re gonna go ahhhhhh and let it nice and open and tall Ready Breathe in Ahhhhhhh Big low breath Ready Ready Here we go Okay That s far too sweet We need it to get ugly Let it get ugly and I want a slide I need to hear every single pitch Ready Really try and let that sound vibrate in your forehead Sing it like I want you to zero that sound right at me like you really mean it I know you do Ready Much better Again Get a big breath Again I want to hear every pitch on the One two ready go I love it Do it here Whoo Sit down Take out What Do the Stars Do Please my friends look at part one Big breath This is tricky because we start on a low so It s what do the stars Very very high Make sure you re sitting up with good posture Here we go I am so impressed that you remember so much of that That was beautiful We re gonna do it again We want a really round ooh and I need a little more emotion on Do you feel it Think about it You re singing to the stars How cool is that Right Here we go Not like celebrities either like the actual stars in the sky Here we go Love what I m hearing Is the word do interesting Or do we just kind of seem to hold it forever and it s kind of boring Speak really loudly Christopher what was your idea We could crescendo We could crescendo I think that s a great idea I think it needs some kind of motion So let s put a little crescendo on the word do Ryan what s your question A sforzando We ll try that in a second Let s see We ll choose which one we like better Let s try just a crescendo on do just to keep it interesting So it s Try and do it in one breath If you have to breathe Don t breathe at the same time as your neighbor Stagger Ready Here we go I love the crescendo We have to get it together for up Right Let s try Ryan s idea You want to do a sforzando on do Okay Let s try it Ready So it s That was your idea too Maria Let s try that Ready Here we go You like that You like it Raise a hand for crescendo Quiet A quick quiet hand Raise that quiet hand for crescendo Raise a quiet hand for sforzando Okay Sforzando wins That s what we re gonna do on the word do Love it It s really really pretty Make sure the word do You keep it really nice and open Claire are you sitting on a chair Or are you sitting between Rose and Garrety Just go grab a chair You don t have to squish like that Ready Here we go It s okay I know she came in a little late So that s why she s You looked a little too close for comfort over there Yeah very strong Yes Ready Just Lauren move in a little bit What happens there What happens there on that one It goes one up higher Thank you Rachel Right Can we start right before 11 Pick ups to 11 Ready Here we go What comes next Where are we That s how far we want to get today on that Look at where the clouds where the clouds can fly Notice part three does Is your pitch after the word higher lower or the same as the pitch in part three Higher lower or the same as the pitch as below Are you sure We start on the same So that s how you re gonna know to Yeah Is this gonna be beautiful This is gonna be Sorry I think this is gonna be really beautiful like which one we just did Yeah It has a lot of the same kind of qualities but there s some really rich harmonies and some really rich beautiful opportunities for crescendo and decrescendo and all that kind of stuff Yes The whole song isn t a cappella It s a cappella in parts Yeah It starts out a cappella which means no piano Jeffrey sit up It s a cappella for a little while and then the piano comes in Then it s a cappella again and then the piano comes in and then it ends a cappella So it kind of goes back and forth What we want to get from this for today from this piece is I want to hear your expression I want to hear that crescendo that decrescendo Same thing on the word clouds What do we think What should It s another one of those long notes So we need to do something with it What should we do with it Decrescendo Put a crescendo in it Energize it a little bit Should we try each Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better So the long cloud Two of them We have two of them So let s energize them and then we ll try backing off Let s see Ready I believe that s our pitch Ready Here we go One Two Do we like that Just energize it a little bit That was crescendo Do we want to try backing off Which one do we like better you guys Let s try the decrescendo Ryan question Oh one of each That s what you re thinking Rose So make one crescendo one decrescendo So maybe which one So first one grow second one decrescendo Yeah kind of pulling back a little Posture First one is gonna grow Ready I love it I love it Let s do from the beginning of that piece All right Think about your expression Singing about stars One two three one Beginning So it s and our do What were we gonna do with it I know it s hard when I m by the piano I won t be Ready Here we go Beautiful Beautiful I think that piece is gonna be gorgeous I can t believe it s only your second day on it Yeah You know what The clouds or the clouds can fly had a really beautiful crescendo lovely expression Put that one under your chair and take out You re a Grand Old Flag 
 Okay so ready to go here Okay I d like to take you back to the fifth century To a time when Attila the Hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of Gaul or Western Europe much to the chagrin of the Roman Empire But where I hear you ask Is Attila the Hun himself Well I fear he has perished He died in a drunken brawl would you believe on his wedding night And who am I I hear you ask to be telling such a tale Why I am Mrs Attila the Hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of Gaul Javelins and bows and arrows those were very well and good for tacticians such as Attila the Hun but what do I know about tactics Not much So I need something Very little you are right Josh the Hun is right So what I need is to get some sort of a war machine Now let s first think about what characteristics do I need in a weapon that would help us against to help us conquer the lands of Gaul What characteristics do we need in the weapon What do we need it to do Hurt people In other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or Force something else So a force we need to have some sort of force Range What else I m sorry Jackie Range Range the range would be a good thing especially if we can get beyond bow range right That would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far right Steph Efficiency Efficiency can you tell me more about what you re thinking Well being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering All right we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done We need to be able to not perhaps use every single Hun for it So efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it Anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages Yes Katie Possibly something that you could use again Oh yes if we only use it once that s kind of a problem isn t it We want to be able to use it repeatedly Good idea Other things we want to think about Joe Something that s mobile All right so maybe wheels might help or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried Okay those are good thoughts Jackie Accessibility like making sure it s easy to use and not like difficult to set up So if it takes a bunch of people and they re struggling to reset it maybe not a good idea Something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle All right so we ve had a good deal of ideas so far That s really good So I need some sort of a war machine Something that would have all of those properties in it Hmmm why what is this Message for you Mrs The Hun A message okay let s see Why it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet Ooh We have a picture of our new war weapon but here s the challenge I need to build the best trebuchet the best war machine that I can and I m not certain what properties what characteristics what parts of this machine I should emphasize How big they should be how strong they should be So I m going to need you to help me out I m going to make little groups of Huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet Each group can then test a different quality What sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet to see what would be the best one Caroline Caroline The weight on the opposite end All right the weight the counter weight and the load Both of those things and perhaps the ratio of them could be rather important Josh Like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle All right the lever arm and how it changes that could be an important idea Other things that we might be able to change to vary or test Anything else we might be thinking of Kate On the angle right there Ah yes the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with There s a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it So the angle of launch and changing that could be important Anything else we might try Anything else we could change We ve had some really good ideas All right so I d like to break you into your small groups and I d like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test We ll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information So I need you to prove your loyalty me Huns Build this trebuchet and test it and if Attila the Hun were here right now he d say What are you doing laying your duffs Get to work Huns Let s get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet And you can choose whatever it is that interests you You can choose something that we did or something different But what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work You have to decide I m going to change this part of it and keep everything the same until we take data Remind me first of all what it was you were changing Counterweight Counterweight so you re leaving the same object that you re launching We re just changing counterweight So what is that your weight Yes Okay so what challenges did you have if any in building this to test your counterweight We had problems with the sling and the pouch Like at first we made it really long so like that didn t really work It didn t go anywhere it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself it s kind of like too long So like it So a little engineering before you could quite get one to work but you did then eventually get one by changing the shortening the string and shortening the sling Yeah All right So at that point then it looks like you had some data and you took several trials Was there anything just off the end any pattern you happened to notice just as you were taking the data We noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like it would float and then just kind of fall So there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it Yeah like our data we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like really far to like back again What if I wanted to know not 600 grams or 650 but 625 How could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond if I wanted to know what s going to happen at 775 Make a graph or an equation Yeah Actually either of those would work coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph To me the graph is a very visual way of doing it You could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it s some other sort of a curve All right and that will allow us to look at other data points which I think would be very helpful So your job then between now and Wednesday is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were from your trebuchet without sharing all of the numbers but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found I think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down I think that s very interesting the fact that it s consistent So help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data Okay All right We can do that Hello Ready to share trebuchet Here s our data Okay so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing We were looking for the angle The angle okay and when you were trying to build your trebuchet what challenges if any did you have in trying to test this angle Well when we were doing it we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable So it couldn t be like super secure It had to be we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks so it was really easy to move Okay It wasn t a super intense trebuchet but it works Yeah we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks Now I m not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century but I think No like twigs Twigs We ll do it with twigs that s a good idea Alright so then it looks like you took some data at different angles and you figured out then the range that it went Was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data It s okay to say no Yeah we noticed you d want to start it like farther back like there d be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle Right Because then it s Because if it was positive it wouldn t really go anywhere Starting with angles that made sense that you knew would give you enough energy to start it All right and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try That the farther back you went the greater length that it would go So the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range Yes that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one Now what limited you or was there a limit You stopped at negative 45 could you have gone negative 50 or No that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small It wasn t like high up to go all the way back Ah okay all right You were commenting on being high up When we get together on Wednesday and we talk about conclusions we ll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do Where if you took the same model but just lift it up Lifted it up adapted it see if that would matter All right that sounds good So we ve got several angles to comment on If I wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees or negative 35 or at negative 50 is there some way I could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond Is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose Yeah you could probably think of an average you wouldn t assume that it would be like 100 accurate we wouldn t guarantee that but it would give a good idea All right so if you did some averaging work if you did some been thinking of Actually not so much averaging You could even set it up like Like side by side like triangles Okay okay So figuring out maybe the ratios Yeah that s That you should get here using your when you say your size and dimensions All right and that is an analysis that is so legitimate These are equations you can come up with You do have the option of doing it visually that is with a graph Where you have your angles one direction and your range the other Just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far You may find that there isn t enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you re certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that s easily recognizable So you get to choose however you want to analyze your data When we come together on Wednesday I will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one Some groups will find that there s no conclusion that the So that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers So that s your job for Wednesday and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test Also a bonus that we can measure data Okay All right thank you good job The farthest range It was 650 grams for the counterweight Six five zero Yeah Alrighty so that s good So we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that All right very good Fifth group tell us about your data and your trebuchet Okay our variable was the angle of launch as well Angle okay that s good And we analyzed it visually basically and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was the larger the range was The larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that Not really it just kind of continues As long as you continue to increase the angle you increase the range So you mean like the angle of release of the sling Or the like how far back the arm goes before you let it go How did you measure your angle Oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up the larger the distance was Okay so the larger the angle to platform Like what other angle could we have used The back arm Okay and this one was how far we pulled it back Yeah So isn t that the same angle then Yeah but we just measured it inside All right All right so slightly different perspectives we ve all found angles on All right our sixth group We varied the counterweight also Okay counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data We made a chart and a graph Okay so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed what did you graph We graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range That s reasonable The counterweight versus range All right and as you examined your chart and the graph data what did you come up with as a conclusion The more weight we put on the further the range was Was there an upper limit or not Not from the amount of weight that we tested I mean I would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle then it would probably would have bad results So that actually gives us a place to go in future If we were to try to add more to the slab that might be something kind of interesting to find out is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail That might make a difference with our big trebuchet We want the biggest one that was successful Were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet Josh The angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot All right and in fact if we were to combine that with your counterweight we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet Other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would ve liked to have added to or varied Steph When the sling did release we could never really tell where it did and we couldn t really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it s supposed to So you could never really tell 
 Like learning is supposed to be a privilege not a burden It s like Supposed to be Like that s why we re America We have the choice you re not supposed to be forced to do it Okay Um but like about them picking a random person they might they might not just go pick a random person if they have to vote because if they have to vote then they re gonna go see that candidate candidate s political beliefs are and what he or she is gonna do for the country Okay Trevor But if um they re not gonna know which one to pick if they re not educated or don t know about the person Okay What if they don t know how to read In their researching They don t know how to read Okay Do you want me to say my question Yeah go ask your question Okay um If only like when we don t have the law only 60 percent vote so how is that supposed to show what America really wants How is that supposed to show what president we want and what choices we wanna do But if we do get the other 40 percent that already don t wanna vote then they would just pick one and that still wouldn t be the the will of the big United States And outta the 60 percent votes you could just make your uh votes outta that What do you mean Like the people that did vote just choose a person who did get the most votes But we wanna see what America as a whole really wants not what a little over half of America wants Um our founding fathers vote for the right to vote for for freedom and so I think we should use that wisely Okay elaborate on that a little bit Say that one more time Um if our founding fathers vote for the right to or fought for the right to freedom then I think we should use that correctly So you think that if the founding fathers looked at this law they would say this is not what we meant when we said you know we want people to vote for our leaders they didn t want us to force people they still wanted it to be a freedom Didn t we like like have the law for like trying to get the opinion of the whole population of America The other 40 percent it still wouldn t be like their decision because they would just pick one they wouldn t really care So they re not really getting any difference by not having the law But we re not forcing them to do that we re forcing them to help America So you re forcing them Okay Jackson can you respond to that point Um Yes if you like if we don t force people to vote then maybe the poor just can t make it there And if we say oh you have to vote then we then we could like provide them transporation to get to there Also if poor people won t vote that means rich people will vote and they ll just vote for the person who they believe is gonna keep them rich and that they d not go against that Do you think that that represents the majority of Americans if only those wealthy or at least middle to upper class people are voting No No Because if the poor people don t vote they re already poor that s already bad enough and they don t get to voice their opinion and in a democracy too That s just even worse And that s a big segment of people right So you re saying that really a lot of these people maybe it s that it s not that they don t want to vote it s that they don t have the opportunity we need to provide some more public um opportunities like opportunities like public transportation to allow them to vote to make it easier Okay Cause it s not only poor and uneducated people it s just people that really don t care that much and like when making those people vote like kind of what she said they could most a lot of em could try and break the law if you force them to vote Because they just don t want to and they really don t care and like if there s somebody who has who doesn t care but they re being forced to vote and they have a really busy job and they have a lot going on they wouldn t have time to research or anything and so they could they would just have to go out there when they did have to vote they d just vote for someone cause they never had any time to do any research or look at something about the people to vote for Okay let s come back to that point cause I think we still have some questioners who haven t asked their question who s who s up next Jaylen Um you say there are different ways to give them their complete and to vote but what are those ways What d she say Well if you have things Hold on Let me let me make sure they heard what you re saying Say it again but say it louder Okay Um I say it s different ways to get them to vote but what are those ways that you get them to vote Does anybody have a ready response for that I can t hear her She s saying you guys are saying there are better ways than compulsory voting laws there s other and better ways so what are those ways Like just because they re poor doesn t mean they can t know that like you can like hang up posters or like get someone to hand out flyers or something It doesn t have to be all electronic I m not talking about poor people Well she s saying It could help anybody really but Okay Respond Well but there are poor people that wanna vote they don t have a chance to Excuse me Well hold on hold on a second Hold on hold on cause I I m not sure that y all are understand what her point is Say your point again Um With some passion With passion Cause that ll make your point Just scream at her WHAT are different WAYS that you can get the American people to vote Besides Besides posters because a poster s not gonna It s compulsory voting And besides these laws what are some better ways to make people vote Well y all keep sayin go and like pick up people and providing transportation well instead of doing that to make them vote you might as well just do that so that they might have the opportunity to vote rather than having to vote So you don t necessarily have to have these laws to still provide some public services to encourage people to vote Okay And like we all know that we get those like very long phone calls that are like vote for this person because they re gonna do all this stuff and like that then like someone who gets that phone call could actually think about it and then like maybe I should vote for that person and you see the big billboard thingies that have the big names on it and all the signs in the yards and so that could make you think well maybe I should go vote since all these people are saying we should vote for that person So you you think they should have an increase in in publicizing elections we should we should have more advertising when elections come up Okay Okay Well if you were to like have election um that would like cost a lot of money to have like a lot of um transportation going around So um and it s like not a lot of people are gonna use that transportation then why just like so why not just make them vote cause they already have public transportation out there Okay Let s top on that one we ll come back to it because we ve got one more question Uh if we didn t require people to vote what would happen if what would happen if like nobody voted decided to vote Say that one more time If we didn t require people to vote what would happen if like nobody decided to vote Or a small majority of people Okay Well people have different opinions like some people think that we put a voice out into the government and say what we want and then some people think like that we that every vote counts And basically there s like five three million people in America and I don t think every single one of them would not vote Okay Any other responses But we already have 60 percent voting I mean and so we know every some people are going to vote It s just the people who don t care about politics and just like when we had the survey people a lot of people didn t vote for the midterm election But on the other hand some people did We re always gonna have a group that doesn t vote and a group that is voting and if you make them vote they re not gonna care Even as more as they did when they weren t voting Okay I m gonna go ahead and open up the floor because we ve asked all the questions so pretty much anybody can answer or ask but let s try and keep it on the same topic so if you are raising your hand make sure you re responding to what the last person said Okay Uh let s see Connor Oh like you said every vote counts but like we need more people to vote so we know that like we know the exact number of like who is going to be the president or in the House of Representatives or the Senate So that theres a better chance that they will get elected Okay so we need a more accurate portrayal of what people think We need more people to vote so we really know what Americans think Okay Well I agree with Connor but going back to what everybody over there is saying they re all saying oh they they won t care they wont they wont care or anything and they wont pay attention to what happens but I mean if we can make like some kind of exception for like special needs people for the deaf and blind and then um also we can get people to stand out in front of a booth and once they ll go get there you can do a speech about both candidates and their ups and downs Okay so you re saying actually have people at the voting polls that are kind of breaking down the two sides Maybe for those people who didn t take the time to research it Okay Um one of y all keep sayin we keep sayin that they might not care but like in actuality if you if someone doesn t care and you force them to care not only is that kinda like convincing like brainwashing them it s also if you force someone to do something they re not going to want to anymore So that wouldn t be helping anything So you re saying it s it s gonna actually make them more bitter toward voting if you force them to do it Okay And someone said that it s gonna be for the good of the country for making them vote but if they could choose a bad a bad person cause it wouldn t be for the good of the country then Okay so if you force them to vote and then they go and vote for a bad person that s not gonna be helping the country at all Okay Jason Um like um you could um for those people that can t vote or um you could put the they could put the polls the voting polls near where those people uh live and um so that they could like if they can t drive there in a car they could just walk there because it d only be like maybe a block down their way Okay You could like open a public train like so they don t have to pay to go as much And then make it free Yeah For that day Okay Alexandra what do you think Alright um well like making people vote is gonna make them more interested in like the country and then they ll actually care cause like they re not gonna wanna like break a law and so then they re gonna actually care about the country and so they won t just be choosing a random person they re gonna actually start caring and start thinking about who they should choose You really think if if we force them to vote then they they will become more interested in politics and they ll go out and research it Okay Like just like if you make some make everyone vote then it s really not gonna change their opinion they re still gonna have like they re still gonna not really care as much as the person that would go out and vote without being forced So you re really not getting an accurate number of what they think they want because they still just because you re making them vote doesn t mean they re gonna necessarily pick the right person Okay Um they re always saying like that we still have this 40 percent that haven t voted well everyone like even the poor people and the uneducated well everyone knows that there s a presidential election or some kind of election going on you can t it s like impossible to not know about it and so really it s their choice that they didn t vote most of the people who aren t poor but they re like middle class like they won t make the choice to vote if Okay So you re A lot of people have made the choice to vote So you re saying the presidential election everybody knows about it everybody probably has an opinion because it s all over the place so and 40 percent are not obviously those 40 percent know that they don t wanna go and vote They ve chosen not to vote Most of them have chosen not to vote Okay You know I have to disagree with you when you say that if we just tell people to vote they ll just pick a random person What I think is that if people are being told to vote they ll just go in there and say well if I m being told to vote I just might as well just pick someone good You d think that they would actually try and think about something before they vote like the term look before you leap So you think if they have to go to the effort of voting they re at least gonna think about it They re at least gonna form an opinion Okay Um like you put of um you you could like make the offices make the person take the day off and like sort of give them the day off And that s 
 tilted towards the Sun you re closer to the sun which is heat which means you re going to be warmer When you re tilted away from the Sun then there s less heat because you re farther away from it it s going to be colder That s what changes the seasons Once again it goes in orbit Like you said the closer we are to the Sun or the father away once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit I think that tilt causes the seasons and the closer we are tilted to the Sun that means it s like Summer or Spring then if we re tilted back it s Winter or Fall I m kind of understanding what you guys are saying Because I m thinking of it as like say like the globe that s sitting right there say that Ben was the sun You can use that if you d like Say that Ben was the Sun the Sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe because the globe s tilted So there wouldn t be much Sun at the top of the sphere because that s the most tilted away from the Sun So it would cause Summer lower and on the other side it would cause Winter Why are you shaking your head I disagree I think the Sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom because like Antarctica and stuff always cold and it s at the bottom So I think it hits more in the top and in between like by the equator Because as you go down South it s more warmer but still if you go down way down to Antarctica it s totally freezing they don t get no sun That s not right Because there is like sunlight in Antarctica and stuff It s just cause like the latitude and longitude and like because Because Antarctica s at zero degrees So it s cold down there I want to know when the Sun is going in its orbit if it just goes from this to this like boom or if its turning and its like facing the Sun like that like I don t understand that Okay So our question is what Like when you re going around the Sun and its on its axis like this tilted and it goes around eventu Does it just like go like that Like real quick And then it s like shifted so the bottom is getting more light and that would put us in Winter What do you think Kaylie You haven t said anything Do you think that our our tilt s going to just change No I think it s like whenever we re rotating like it goes around the Sun in the orbit Can I show She s saying that as it s rotating it s staying the same it s just that it s changing because you re changing position from which way the Sun is Can I show an example with the globe Yeah please Say the Sun was in the middle Say like the globe is right here Say we re right here it s Summertime really close and the Sun s right here And as we go around like maybe like we re right here and this is Fall and then we go to Winter And as we turn this way for the Spring and then we re back to Summer again because we re going around the sun so But the only problem with that is we re still going to be tilted away when it when we go over towards the Sun We re still going to be tilted away won t we Well the Earth s always tilted Yeah but we ll be tilted away In the Summer you re tilted towards the Sun Let s go back to does the tilt change Okay so we re definitely talking about this tilt and I m guessing there s a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt Yes So if you think you understand the tilt help everybody else understand We re not getting this tilt in what you re talking about So explain it the best way you can and help each other okay so I don t get this tilt Does it just flip flop What do you think Anna I think it stays the same What about you Shana You haven t said anything yet Well as the Earth goes around in its orbit it shifts just like a little bit that way you re like closer to the Sun And then during the Winter we re father away Is that how it is We re closer towards the Sun in the Summer and we re father away in the Winter Yes Who doesn t think that Could I try something with the globe real quick Yes Could I borrow Nick to be my Sun Yeah Be his Sun Nick Come on Sun Go out there and stand in the middle Pretty dark Sun Yeah you are Okay we re gonna say that this little pin here is where the Sun is hitting today All right And we re spinning woah spinning that way It s spinning it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning but it never it never tilts back towards the Sun That s what I don t understand does it just go like this This is a really good question This is a really good question Now I want wait don t move yet I want go ahead be the Sun still And I want you to walk around and explain to people what you re talking about Number one show us the tilt Okay that s the tilt Show everybody the tilt Okay everyone this Nick move you re in the way of people Just duck down just crouch And this is the way of the tilt the way it s tilted that way But as we go around it s still tilted that way And this side here is still far away so what It s going to stay Winter all the time Or is it just going to like flip And be like Hey guys look Now we re Summer but we re upside down That s what I don t understand He has a very good question okay His question is why is what hemisphere are you talking about The Northern Hemisphere Okay So why is the Northern Hemisphere always tilted towards the Sun how he s walking away Because his argument is that Oh I have it right here Go ahead It says Because the Earth s axis is slightly tilted when the North Pole is laying towards the Sun and South Pole is laying away from the Sun And when the South Pole is leading towards the Sun the North Pole is leading away from the Sun It says As a result the number of daylight hours in the Northern and Southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the Earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator the hemisphere that leads towards the Sun has a long day and short nights Does that have to do with anything See I Wait Does that have to do with anything That s Sabrina s question Does that have to do with anything So summarize what you just read to us Does the tilt have like also have to do with like the days and like the short days and short nights Does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights and long days and short nights Shawn you re shaking your head yes You think it does have to do with it Say yes Yes You think it does have to do with it Why Who could help him explain why would a tilt change the length of day Move over Lucas Because like it s if like it ll be indirect Sun if it s tilted away from it And instead of like I don t know I think it is because I think another thing in the direct rays because the way we re tilted it s the number of daylight hours because of the less Sun as much of the Sun because of the tilt and how the Sun hits it when its on its tilt I think like see how it tilted that way No why don t you use it Why don t you boys sit down and let Pass that globe over to Byers and let him explain What I think is You know how it s tilted this way Maybe it ll tilt the opposite direction for the Summer Like instead of it being tilted towards this it ll tilt the other way for the South Instead of the North be showing the South would be showing That s what I think Where is the Sun That s what I m not understanding The Sun would usually be in the middle You need a hand Yeah Okay go ahead be the Sun again The Sun s in the middle And that s why if it s tilted this way we re getting our Sun but I thought if it would tilt the opposite way like instead of being tilted this way it d tilt that way then the South would get more Sun Okay So how But what you re asking is the same question as Lucas Yeah How does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the Sun That s what you re trying to figure out Whenever Lucas walked it around the whole time what hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun The Southern Hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun And the Northern Hemisphere was pointing away from the Sun Ben No I thought it was the Northern was pointing to the Sun and the Southern was pointing the other way But it remained constant the whole orbit Yes That s what I couldn t figure out like how did it just like did it like flip around and all of the sudden Maybe the Sun it changed What do you guys think Does the Sun move JJ you haven t been in here yet I think like every day it moves a little to the other side Wait what does The Earth The Earth moves everyday Yeah it might Like it tilts every day It tilts the tilt is changing Is that what you re saying So the tilt changes What were you gonna say I think the It The Earth like doesn t move like when it stays in one spot I think it might like flip Like kind of like just go around like Can you show us Do you wanna show us Sure I ll try I was gonna say maybe like as it s as like the Earth turns around maybe it like tilts forward every so often and backward So you re telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips Yes Okay so what are you saying It just goes around like this and eventually it just like spins around So it spins on top of its rotation Yeah What do you think Brad I think yeah I kind of agree with him Wait with who with David While it s like going around its orbit it just like tilts So the tilt is changing Yeah What do you think Alec You haven t said anything yet I don t agree with him I think that it spins while its moving around Don t raise your hand you don t have to raise your hand Only this like what Nick just did or maybe every day it goes a little bit and tilts like this And the Sun hits more of the Southern It s like everyday goes a little bit little bit little bit so where the South starts to get more Sun Because like when we re in Summer and Australia has Winter So when we re in Winter Australia has Summer So And it s in the Southern half and we re in the Northern half Wait Tiffany you were shaking your head Do you agree with what he s saying Sort of yeah Because if one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight the most likely it s gonna be warmer than the other Like he was saying when we get more sunlight and the temperature s warm up here the temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere get a little colder if they don t have as much sunlight and not as much warmth You see what I mean Like say I m right here the Sun is tilted so you see how the Sun s right here And then it tilts a little bit like this We re still getting Summer sunlight but Australia s getting more sunlight I have to agree with what JJ said earlier It tilts everyday So the tilt is changing You think that the tilt is changing Morgan you think the tilt is changing No I don t think it s changing I think it s staying the same because even I think the rotation helps because if it goes around the orbit even though its rotating it helps Like Nick you re the Sun like and the axis stays and when it rotates the Earth rotates and it s like kind of it like helps us I don t know like indirect sunlight I don t know Something like that I can show what she means I think Go ahead I think it s also about the gravitational pull Like when it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull As it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull Okay when you do this Grace please explain to me what it is So that everybody here that s watching can try and make sense of what we re talking about I think what she s saying is like say Nick s the Sun again Since the Northern is that way I think she s saying is it doesn t rotate but this is but we re kind of going around kind of like this So then it changes So now the Southern is towards the Sun and the Northern is that way So now it s changed She did something very different in her orbit Did anybody catch that Yeah yeah Like she it didn t move it just went around like around the Sun What do you mean it didn t move The Earth stayed still and just moved at one point It didn t do that Okay let s do it again okay And I want you to make sure that number one everybody sees where you start and everybody sees what happens to the Earth as she s showing you how it s going around So explain to us What is this Where are we starting Okay we re starting out this way with the Northern towards the Sun and the Southern away from the Sun And as we are rotating I don t know if all of you guys can see this But as we re going around Stop there It s not moving So since it s not moving now the Northern is kind of like facing away and the Southern is facing towards the Sun now Keep going And then just make sure that the camera can see what you re talking about as you go around Okay So did everybody see that Who doesn t understand that Who didn t understand what she did right there Okay So Now I don t understand actually wouldn t it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis and then start rotating again I m not sure what you mean by that Like you spun it like this All right But the Earth is going like this the whole time Would that end up stopping and then it go like this Or is that still happening It s not turning like that It s just rotating around the Sun Wait Sabrina you had something to say Okay So here s what s happening Lucas is a little confused about your explanation okay So we just have to go through it again What did you have to say Sabrina The earth doesn t change its tilt It stays like an exact same position but when it goes around the Sun it gets like different ways like the Sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers Okay wait why don t you try to show him Maybe it s just a different person Maybe it will help explain it okay So the more people we can get information out of remember the more we re gonna understand So start and tell us what s happening And just make sure the camera can see what you re doing The Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun and the Southern is facing away So this causes colder weather and up here where it s facing the Sun causes warmer weather So when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here the Southern is facing towards Wait is the Southern facing towards The Southern s facing towards the Sun And the winter is facing away Which causes it to be warmer down here and Winter up here Who can help her out because What I don t understand is Go ahead go ahead I don t understand it because it s still changing from day to night but then it s shifting so wouldn t it have to stop spinning and then shift If it stops spinning we re gonna die Not necessarily Okay wait Ben start from the beginning and explain what s going on Nick is our Sun still Put your legs in so he doesn t trip Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun Southern s away And it s still spinning it doesn t change Okay And so stop there and what s happening The Southern Hemisphere s towards the Sun and the Northern s away from it And what happened to the tilt the whole time It didn t change It what It didn t change It didn t change it stayed the same But that made more sense Like I couldn t figure out why it wasn t spinning but now I do And then it keeps going And then it just goes back Now I understand Okay Let s use this model and try to figure out where are the seasons happening So where do we live Anna We live Yeah where he s pointing What s that called somebody America North America North America let s get bigger Northern Hemisphere What Byers The Northern Hemisphere Okay so we live in the Northern Hemisphere Right now what s happening It s Summer It s Summer in the Northern Hemisphere Does everyone see that Yes Yes Anybody not see it s Summer in the Northern Hemisphere see it Yeah Okay so 
 Isn t it nuclear fission when like fusion No fusion is when they combine Nuclear fission is like when they split apart right Yes so it s a fission process See Ah So that s a I see that that efficient Efficient It increases the safety though right It s impossible to explain No I m just saying does it No I don t understand Am I the only one here Apparently to you though So why is it that when the atom is unstable it s radioactive It could be it s removing protons and neutrons I think you guys can discuss this Isn t it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom or something and then it gains the neutron and that s when it starts becoming like More vulnerable More vulnerable and it starts like a chain reaction You guys agree I agree I agree I agree with everybody That s right So how can radiation help them Like Amy said It could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources Like you said What else though Like cancer Cancer Cancer I mean I had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away It kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication Any last thoughts Okay that s fine thank you I have only one major I guess comment about that one I noticed Steve used a lot of vocabulary words He did remember a lot of the words and I think he planned for that And then I liked the way that David actually redirected the group He asked the group How can radiation help us right at the end and then people responded to that So he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group So and then people were able to respond So that was a nice way to create a discussion Okay question number two Three Three I m sorry Okay I mean How about number four next Okay I m going to do number four next No Do number three The one with three No I m going to do four No I want to do three Okay number four is going to go next You have two minutes to prepare Number four Just ignore it What is that A microphone Oh it works So they can hear me right now Oh It s recording Well why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the USA and what are some arguments for nuclear energy David put that away Okay Jane who s going to go next Me Jane Okay so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on Nuclear power plant nuclear power plant Well pick several The nuclear yeah The nuclear power plant can help us create more energy I mean well it s Nuclear radiation for my argument You know what Dano was saying No He was just going to put power plants Do you know what it is Yeah it s where they Yeah Okay what does it do Creates energy Okay Okay what other evidence are you going to use though The fact that we are running out of well we re not running out of but in the future we might not be able to find enough energy So we need to start We need to start thinking about the future like Jobs and stuff No future things that are like the future and what s going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply Like what if we were running out and start thinking about that Okay so the next person Okay so the people on the outside if you were recording the vocabulary last time I want the people on the outside to switch so that you re recording something different So if you did evidence first switch to vocabulary If you did vocabulary switch to evidence Oh Sindi sit like right here Okay this question is why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U S and based on the video we watched what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy I think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U S because it doesn t release chemicals therefore it s eco friendly making the U S more green Environmentally green I agree with her because another reason I think the president might support it is because like like right now we re in an economic crisis what you call the thing And then like making new plants may create more jobs for people It ll create jobs for building them and then it ll also benefit everybody for clean power I agree I agree because it builds economic stabilization and it ll create jobs for the future like for more years because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need you know like to build it And once it s built you still need to work with it so I think the job s going to last for a while I agree But if we re in an economic crisis like if we re in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it Like where s the money going to come from Well we re already in debt so we ll get even more debt Yeah it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor We d get funding Yeah And we have to like think about the future and how it s going to benefit you know for the economy and making more power plants would just provide like a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff And more you know we ll get more electricity You know if we build more nuclear power plants Yeah and not just 20 but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that needs luxuries rising electricity demands It won t leave the U S behind and all the new tech stuff And the more factories and the more power plants we produce we make the more electricity and the more factories it will get more stuff It will build the more jobs and that will raise up the economic problems Yeah because more stuff will be done that way So now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy What do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of The thing that causes cancer Probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off Well they don t give it off the water the coolant or whatever And then like they don t have nowhere to store it I think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build but they didn t build They re going to run out of space to put the waste in Also it s going to cause cancer to everyone But doesn t it cure cancer and stuff It has benefits but more like some freak accident can happen like what happened in Fukushima Or the third mile At the Three Mile Yeah So say you never know what can happen that s the downside Because if it does happen then it s like downhill from there because people start getting sick then their kids start dying and I don t know Yeah and like Giovanni said if we are in an economic crisis like where are we going to get the rest of the money We re just going to get it from debt and stuff like that We re going to help raise it up but we ll also fall more in debt Yeah Going back to the nuclear waste can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem Because it s just there Kevin I think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution That s what I think Cause more what It causes more war and pollution War Well I mean This isn t on camera right Okay someone else Wait what was the question again Elaborate on what is nuclear waste Nuclear waste Why is that such a problem for us Well it s a problem because there s nowhere where you could actually safely put it Other than like I think they have this I read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes That s the only place that you can like get rid of it Don t throw it in the ocean because it ll contaminate everything You can t just like leave it in the ground because then it ll probably like leak And also doesn t it if it rains if water gets in it it s dangerous So that s why they have to find a place where it s not like Why is it dangerous if water gets into it Soil I guess The waste and the water mix and then like it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it ll mess up the ocean or like water And we end up drinking it And scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste like they re thinking of shooting it out into space or anything One thing nobody talked about was half life What does the half life have to do with nuclear waste I think a bunch of years What does it have to do with Obama Say it louder What Say it louder We re talking about that noise Wait what was your question What does half life have to do with nuclear waste Half life nuclear waste So energy So why is nuclear waste bad exactly Oh because they haven t determined the amount of years of when the half life is I think they determined like So they so it was an estimate It wasn t actually a fact they just estimated that so it could be before so they wouldn t be able to prevent to prevent it from affecting society Oh good So let s just get this done Let s try the next group okay Thank you I know Bryan I don t need to look it up I know this already Okay Do you guys want to break before you go up Okay you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself So it s not a shock Okay question number three let s come up People seem anxious let s do this Okay no phone Diana We re missing people Yeah we are Okay so people on the outside you guys should switch So if you did evidence you know So what you did one time evidence looking for evidence and one time you re looking for vocabulary Okay So people on the outside make sure you re checking different parts Okay so what I might change the question you guys What It happens Okay number three What recommendations would you make to President Obama regarding clean energy and climate change So for example they re trying to build two nuclear power plants in Georgia So what recommendations will you make to him about building in Georgia Building in jorj ee uh Georgia the state Um I think he should make sure that employees aren t making careless mistakes such as the human error in the Three Mile Island I think that he should promote programs on alternative energy but not just nuclear energy But he could also use nuclear energy because it could because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20 of our energy already comes from nuclear energy So we could just get more energy through nuclear power I think we shouldn t use it because of it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer Okay nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates nuclear power plants create toxic waste I would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it s most struggling Recommendations I would make to Obama regarding nuclear energy is that to stop because it s too dangerous to handle and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists they can use it to murder to murder me or destroy countries We can t prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants then the nuclear radiation which is unstable can harm by radioactivity and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit Fukushima And this means that it can happen to anyone even us That s what I wrote I think it could be a good idea but I think they should focus more on how it could harm people to try and control the harmfulness so it won t harm people Yeah I think it s a good idea I think my recommendation for Obama is that it is not good to nuclear because it s going to affect us it s going to affect our pollution And he s going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn t do that Yeah I agree with Charlie too We don t know what nuclear energy could also like harm us which ways Or I mean we do but I mean it s better Like we could just focus on studying more like having more thoughts Like ask him what s better It s like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we re using now So I have to change one question Based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read what argument has influenced you the most The Fukushima argument So go ahead and explain it to the group though Because um things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us like human error And I think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage the area which is nobody can go because it s radioactive and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like I don t know thousands of years just for the half life and we won t be able to use that space anymore It kills everything People got cancer 
 Does that include slaves Yes Does that include women Yes Okay So how are we supposed to take uneducated people s opinions when they obviously don t know what s gonna happen Because a lot of people in Russia I mean if the Russian s knew how to read they would write a song If they knew what was going on and they were smart enough they would obviously write a song about it I think John Locke had one more thing to say is that right Yes okay and to answer your question about the government The government was created to protect people s rights it wasn t created for you to abuse power and just do what you think you need to do they are only for them and it s not doing what it needs to do then yeah the people do have the right People aren t dead so obviously I m doing what I need to do and I m protecting them If that s all you care about then that would just be easy not to let people die Obviously they re not having problems where their lives threatened We have all these like If you re wherever you live Anyways wherever you live if your king or queen wasn t doing what they thought to protect you guys and you had all these invaders coming in then you could argue being mad at them because they re not protecting you and doing their job That s when you know they re upset Plus you re saying that your people aren t educated but they re educated enough to know what their rights are and how they should be treated so I mean you can think you should be treated in a certain way but I could say I think I should be able to slide on this floor right now but I might not know if I slide on this floor right now I m gonna die But because I m not educated in that kind of way But your king or queen is educated in that kind of way so they re not gonna let you do stuff like that We re not asking for stuff like that we re asking for our natural rights I know that they What s the word The end result Conclusion I know the conclusion of you guys getting your natural rights and the way that you guys are acting for them In a way I m gonna get you guys what you guys need to get your conclusion is gonna be a whole lot better than what you guys are hoping So what s the point of having your natural rights if you re going to abuse the law It doesn t mean you re going to abuse the law it just means that you re gonna be more cooperative towards the law You re attributed to a beggar if they don t give you your natural rights It s like a two way type thing If they give it to you then you re gonna be happy about it and you re gonna want to follow them and listen to them Instead of trying to revolt and kick them out if they re not gonna give it to you Alright so we say government is a good thing bad thing or kind of in between Let s go around the room real quick What would you guys say I would say government is a positive thing because it stopped some starving and it keeps everything in place Okay good We re in between Because it s there to protect your rights but if they re not gonna be there to protect you then they shouldn t be there at all Okay so it has to be done in the correct way Government is a good thing Any explanation why Because if you don t have a government then you aren t organized and if you re not organized then you re like chickens would be in your home We think that philosophers they write what they feel about us and they don t do anything about it and they don t understand where we re coming from You philosophers are lucky men You write on paper and paper is patient Unfortunate Empress that I am I write on the susceptible skins of living beings Meaning that they write on paper because they can put out they opinion like that but we have to be responsible for all the people in our country and we re trying to do what s best for them In your opinion Frederick We think government is interesting because we need a government to be organized But government also does a lot of bad stuff We think the government is completely necessary along with religion because it brings unity to the people And I think the laws and religion kind of go hand in hand because I wouldn t consider myself a Christian but others probably would because of certain stuff I write in books that s why they consider me as a heretic but the bible says Thou shall not kill Killing someone is also against the law Thou shall not steal is also against the law I feel the government is good if it uses the right power basically for their rights and things As long as It should be there we feel it should be there but it needs to be used appropriately We believe sort of that the government is a positive If you didn t have a government as a base structure for your country If you didn t The government perhaps is a positive Due to the fact that the government helps you if you need it to an extent I agree with Catherine the Great in the fact that it sort of really helps with the territory I ve been interviewed by many people and specifically saying to many people I ve said it that I m capable of saying whatever I want So my country is there and I get to do whatever I want If you were the king you d do whatever you want to Theoretically Alright Voltaire Pretty much the government is an abomination I mean there s way more bad and nasty leaders than there are good lawful public leaders that do good stuff Too many leaders take advantage of their people in their kingdoms so I think they should just all go away start over with enlightened total What about slavery What do you think about slavery What do you people think about slavery What about slavery Anybody have an opinion Is slavery good bad or otherwise I wouldn t say slavery is a negative then again I wouldn t say that it s a bad thing either I guess you could say mostly slavery came from Austria due to the fact that if you get in trouble with another country and they sand to the Austria you re pretty much going to be a slave for the rest of your life You pretty much work for them You work for the Pope himself and you work for the Roman Emperor Voltaire I think slavery is a necessary evil A necessary evil Well we disagree with because we see everyone as equals and think everyone should be treated equally and it s part of their natural rights such as freedom Exactly that would be considered one of their natural rights Rousseau Serfs which were similar to slaves very good Last comment there Thomas Hobbes I don t think we really have an opinion on slavery but if the king decided to have slavery in the country I think we should respect that and do it for the betterment of the country Respect the authority of the king No piling up because that s what slavery is there for Okay Very good Any last minute comments I think we re almost out of time for our salon discussion I heard a lot of good ideas Does anybody have any last minute comments that they want to add Yes Frederick A lot of things that we have to say I didn t get Three things of everybody s opinion All you guys are really self You re not sinners or anything For lack of better words And I wouldn t read them meaning I would probably do anything to get support from my people and I d do anything for my people Like my dad would do anything for me he raised me well And slavery and natural rights and all that mumbo jumbo shouldn t be from you because you re not them You re not just as you re not Voltaire and I m not Thomas So you can t overrule anybody else it s not right Very good Excellent job ladies and gentlemen Thank you for attending our little salon here Hopefully we learned some new ideas and got to hear some other opinions of people throughout Europe so let s give yourselves a little round of applause Alright you are now done with the salon You can take your little parts if you want and put them up because you are no longer those people you are now you in modern day times Back to modern day times But I do have some questions we are not done with our discussion but you are not longer your person you are back to being you We are not done and I m going to ask you your questions now Please listen What was the purpose of a salon We ve talked about this from what you ve right here What was the purpose of a salon Exchange ideas Exchange ideas any other purposes Sometimes like Joseph did over there but to find out what people thought of you Okay to find out different opinions Okay maybe see something from a different side or viewpoint It was a devised to discuss music who gets painting time Okay so it has an artistic point to it as well It was just another way for us to learn about taking notes and stuff Like research on our person and then hearing what the other people thought But as far as back then is what we re thinking about Oh back then Oh Yes you were right about what you said Just to exchange ideas and go back until people like it Would you say there were effective back then Yes We haven t talked about results we kind of left off talking about these people and how they talked about things and came to the salon Do you think this is going to be an effective method of discussing The conversations we were having with them over there like how they didn t think that we were listening to what the people were saying and how we were just gonna stay the way we were and stuff but actually they got to hear our thinking about moving to where we need to go it s gonna take them a little longer to get there Okay Do we have anything like salons today Do we have salons today Yes What happens at salons now Right so it s not so much political all the time in exchanging ideas about government stuff but they re still kind of socialization and gossip going on Is there anything that we have in place or anything in our society today which you can discuss opinions especially about government or problems that you might have in life Um Since salons don t really go with that but So if you have a problem with your country or with the government or with something that s going on we don t have a salon to go and meet like this and talk with people but is there anything that we do that Or any other thing Another way to voice your problem if your dissenting and you have a different agreement or a disagreement with the government or with anybody anything What can you do Don t we have press conferences What do you mean representatives Write letters Write letters to who The government Congress the government okay They also have environment issues and worldwide problems Worldwide problems Okay that s kind of similar Where different people come and talk about their issues their problems and maybe how to solve them You kind of have different levels like if you have a problem with like if it s about the school you go to the school board Okay President or people who are trying to be president they have the debates on TV Okay good As far as being an average citizen what can you do Say there s an issue with the world or an issue in our country or an issue in our city that we want to see fixed what can we do you think to maybe go about fixing that or trying to get that done Protest Protest Is that allowed Are we allowed to protest Yes Were you allowed to protest back then It depends on where you live at Depends on where you live We have a different government now right Back then it was monarchy now it s more of a democracy So what we re seeing here a little bit a little bit different method and a lot more opportunity There s a town like 
 Well I can start I just kind of wanted to follow with Lina s going back to the very beginning of the book and sort of I guess a response to Mariana s comment I think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish so it s not about making this huge change in one moment cause that s never going to happen It s about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step And since we are young adults you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives before you know it things are gonna change So even though it seems discouraging like oh it s really hard and upsetting and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting it s about continuing on and taking those little steps Yeah you know at the same time I think there s something hard about it but it s not something that is beyond our control It s just we don t want to appear confrontational Because I thought we were having this discussion on Friday I was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying and was listening if there were any instances although it doesn t count as racism you count it as prejudice by definition I was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit Because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom s boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her and he said Oh I wish you were white he wouldn t do that stuff if you were white This was a black girl There was this other in my physiology class Isn t that not racism Well that s not Do you think she was serious or don t you I don t know but you know even if it s joking it s still a pretty serious thing to say And besides there was a Mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends some relative saying get a bean or a shnean But you know even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where I could have said Well no that s not an appropriate thing to say That could be offensive to people But you know I didn t just because I didn t want to be confrontational So obviously that s some fault of my own for not getting involved there Going off of what Tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever I m wondering if you re considered actively racist if those jokes don t bother you Like I hear that all the time in my third block class and it doesn t bother me It s kind of funny sometimes Because a lot of the time it s not interracial it s the same race You know what I m trying to say There s no Armenians but I can t roast another Armenian Should I throw this This is not gonna work Laser it bro Maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it I think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of show how comfortable we all are with other races and I make fun of my parents I make fun of my teachers because I m comfortable with them Maybe we should talk about that And I mean I can do it because we love each other and it s okay it s unconditional So even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other I m scared So going back to what Lina was saying at the beginning and what Tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing I felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma She makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today and not to say that it s not a giant problem but I feel like one can be passively anti racist whilst working actively towards anti poverty anti hunger anti war and making a difference in the world whether it s in the field of racism or not And then going back to what Tomas said about the and I lost my point what was it It ll come back to me Who wants to go I think Tatum would agree with you and she would even I think say that while you re actively combating say poverty you are having a positive impact for say poor African American families And she points out the correlation statistically speaking between ethnicity and class But one thing I want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that I think that one thing that it means to become an adult and I m thinking what Holly said is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants And I think it s really as simple as that what Tatum is asking of people That she s asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you I want to hear from other people I got my point for Tomas it s coming back It came back to me I had two points when I asked for the yarn then I forgot one of them and I just remembered it I want to encourage other people to speak up too And we ve got 10 minutes left There s a lot of voices that haven t been heard yet today What I m gonna do is something that I m gonna encourage other people to do too I m gonna toss it to somebody who s not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard I ll keep it short and then I ll throw it to someone Okay Toss it to somebody who doesn t have their hand raised though So back to what Tomas said about the confrontational thing is it s really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing And it s the fear of the reaction of either one of those that I think stops most people from speaking up Like either confrontation or you re appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more So Samuel Yeah sure Well I was gonna say out of what Chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually I think while sometimes it contributes to racism and I have a problem with telling too many off color jokes and gender related jokes But I think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff So if you look at people like comedians say like Dave Chappelle how many can say that he s a racist person because he makes lots of race based jokes in his comedy On the contrary I think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out When Tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there s no such thing as being passively anti racist I think what she means by that is like it s sort of hard I actually got to mention you know our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is unweighted or whatever It s kinda difficult to how should I say it I don t know what I was trying to say I can t put it out into words but anyways I kinda agree and disagree with her It s like you can do little things to change however what I was trying to say is that it s a lot out there and it may be difficult That was all I was trying to say I don t even know Here you go What I would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we re addressing it sorta kinda in a way but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society And then for some people that say it that aren t actually trying to make a difference it s like I mean it s gonna be hard to make a change and be like Hey let me correct that Because to them it s just like all fun and games But to us it s like okay Yeah It stopped It died I agree completely with what Laticia is saying Although for instance how Sam was saying about Dave Chappelle although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner it s not like people make jokes so people understand that Oh we need to break these stereotypes I ve come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it Obviously yes by making these stereotypical jokes yes we re addressing it but my point I guess is just it doesn t necessarily prove that people are anti racist Alright I just wanted to say the question the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti racist And it s because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being From when we re born we re exposed to racism consistently And because of that we can t be passively anti racist Our default setting for the most part is being racist Not overly racist but we are So it s not possibe just to not be racist by being alive Once you come to being in this world you are racist You can t change that so that s why there s no such thing as being passively anti racist You have to work at being anti racist It just doesn t happen So I completely agree with what Wyatt s saying The way I look at racism is it s like a poison and once you ve been injected or you know whatever to it it stays in your system forever And there s always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there s always gonna be a little bit of it in you So before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it Which would be parents or teachers I don t know I m a source of it You know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like Oh yeah my teacher said this and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around I don t know it s not you I m just saying I don t believe you Yeah I agree with Wyatt and Brooks because I think that we were talking about how Disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says basically right There are always implicit messages which aren t necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things There are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples speaking So everyone s totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words So yeah If someone s gonna hit you in the face it might as well be this I want to go back to what Brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism I mean how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists They don t even try They might just give you some parental info on your surrounding Or just say those joke you were talking about So you re saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids I m saying that parents should know how to combat racism and they don t even try Going back to what Ryan said earlier I agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich so people won t want to use it anymore 
 In the Lion King like I was thinking about it there s no democracy in any of the movie No there isn t Yeah and how the Lion King s like everything seems really British you know like very England monarchy type stuff But in the Lion King what bothered me is when it said like the two hyenas like Cheech from Cheech and Chong was one of them and then Whoopi Goldberg was the other one I was just like how could they do that and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas Like don t they think about that stuff Yeah I was thinking the same thing Did you think about it before when you first read Cinderella I think when I watched the Lion King like I thought about it I mean even when I was little I think it registered in my mind like That s a black woman s voice Why would her voice be in this animal and not any of the other voices Right I don t know Disney intentionally did this They were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes so I think the mentality of that was why fix what s not been broken and when they should have fixed it But at the same time Mufasa was that really what s his name James Earl Jones who s like Morgan Freeman Right Mufasa was an evil Like if I had to pick a God it would be James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman Mufasa was the good Simba s father right Yeah With like the really deep voice You made a good point though about no democracy in Disney movies There isn t because there s no democracy in marketing There s no democracy in the media What are the six big media conglomerates Disney Disney GE What else GE GE Newscorp Yeah Newscorp Then Viacom Viacom Time Warner And Time Warner But why can t Cinderella be a first lady Why does she have to be a queen Like why can t she have some other magical power Why can t we instill some like actual life in there But that s still not this is still not the classic but then I wouldn t be surprised if Disney will come up with another story I hope they do Well they came up with Tiana right Which added the gender stereo the roles the racial roles or the racial stereotypes Tiana is absolutely beautiful The image However there are again the pre existing culture and norms that Disney is too scared to move away from because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry I did promise you a reading on we do have time I promised you a reading on China as to what happens in China Before I do that I just want your input on the Disneyfication of children s culture with the article that you read I know you wanted to talk about it you were really excited If you have your article in front of you you can use that You can look at it I also jotted down plenty of notes but when you reflect on what we did today I want you to think these books these books are books are media music is media videos are media okay Food for thought for next time when we have our discussion Does media construct an image or a message There s no right or wrong answer but think about it Does the media construct an image or a message Okay As you read your read articles So Hannah to you go ahead The whole like Aladdin where how they changed the verse the lyrics that was like awful That was crazy Like I think I have a different opinion from everybody like truth hurts to me I think it s just like I don t care that it says that Like I didn t notice that no one notices that while they re singing Like while they re singing that no one like realizes oh Cut off your ear Kids don t Like if your was in And that actually happened back then that actually happened The ear one didn t bother me as much because that s kind of true But the whole it s barbaric the like that was awful It shouldn t be Because if you think about where it is if you look into the history it is barbaric and they used to do it And in some places they still do it It s the whole Hammurabi An eye for an eye You know it s that culture Yeah it s true it s true so why not teach what actually happened But I don t really have a problem with it I mean like But if that s the only way that you re looking at the Middle East then that s wrong Because they have a history with beautiful art they invented math and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff that you can t just look at the problems that they have now or the violence that was in their culture because there s violence everywhere I mean that s just stereotyping They cut people s ears off in the Middle Ages in England just as much as they did or at least as the same They did worse things probably in the Middle Ages than they did in cutting off people s ears It s just unfair that they portayed the Middle East like strictly as a barbaric violent place in that song It just makes it wrong I think it was like in general and it was because Arabia was so bad in an oasis like that Yeah they weren t specific it was just Arabia but like it took there was like Indian things about Aladdin that it wasn t supposed to be India it was supposed to be like Israel or totally different There were a lot of like Middle Eastern elements rolled into one so it would make one thing like if you went to the Middle East if you went to like Pakistan it wouldn t be what they say it is or if you went to India or you went to Israel like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one Which looks like a different Why did they do that What would you think They didn t look into it they didn t bother to do the research Yeah they probably didn t Because their culture is so different than American culture that they just thought that they could just skip over it Like I thought it was gross that they didn t even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript Like if it was in English they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper but they just you think that you can just go like this on the board and that looks like Arabic writing That s not Arabic writing is really complicated And the whole thing with all the accents how all the bad guys had accents and the good guys didn t The bad guys had like Oh the beards and noses Bigger beards and then the good guys they looked American I think it made you assume the worst like reading that just made me like Wow like Oh my gosh it s not really giving you the information But yet you didn t notice it when you watched it though right Yeah I mean you didn t at all I did though But then when we re older we go back in history Maybe that s because I have that class and we realized that it s all war with religion and like I know those times Go ahead Religion what about it She noticed that I did notice those things like you can kind of tell like different culturally wise like the different Indian elements in Israel or the different like Pakistani influences but and they had like Hindu going on It s just really really weird But I did notice that but like I don t know maybe like Hannah said she didn t notice that but because she didn t grow up like learning to write Arabic No And like reading about all that stuff I guess it s also like how you grew up Right Someone who showed America like without photos I have a question When you think about it when we talk about American culture we view it as pretty homogeneous of the American values Okay there are these values and that s all there is But we know that that s not true Do you find that to be with these movies by blending all of those different spaces and all those different cultures do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children that the Middle East is highly diverse okay And not everybody looks the same or writes the same or behaves the same but Disney has done something that the media does What does the media assume That everybody who watches a movie Is going to react the same way It s going to react the same way right So the media assumes that homogeneity attitude Yes The problems in the past 20 years in the Middle East like when little kids grow up and it s like if I look at a picture of Osama bin Laden I think Jafar because he has a beard and he looks like that Like we re taught that that is evil Do you really I don t That the person with the turban and beard is evil because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world just happen to be Muslim totally extremist Muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don t practice Kind of like most Christians during the Middle Ages didn t go out and chop people s heads off in the name of Jesus It s the same thing Right You know But we look at those pictures of those Middle Eastern men and we think bad because of it which is like Jafar and Aladdin That s when acceptance comes in like You have to accept what s true and what s not Exactly Talk about ignorance I mean why do we have to accept that Because it s not true Because it s not true there are thousand and thousands You don t see me going like Oh I m making bombs I m not like saying acceptance like it s not true I m not like saying acceptance like Osama bin Laden like accepting that s what he looks like to like Jafar Like that s who he was so that s what he looks like You know what I m saying Yeah but I don t see that If I see if I look at Osama bin Laden I don t see Jafar No I don t either I don t identify it at all I don t either but you know what I m saying Yeah like little kids like 10 years from now if they watch Aladdin and they re going to grow up and what s going to be in the news is September 11th and Osama bin Laden But what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else Like Ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid and still done all the horrible things that she did to Ariel Right Like it doesn t matter what you look like they create these evil images of people like all old ladies are either really smart or they re evil They either have wisdom or they re out to get you There s no in between Or the zoo keeper in he had a German accent he was evil and that was during a war the movie Or like the three crows right That were talking in like the very like I don t know African American inner city slang and they were just all that stuff that was just really It kinds of makes it like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like we have that image like up here like tell them it looks like this so when we see them we automatically assume like Oh man it could be a terrorist just like when we watch a movie like Oh that s the bad guy So like it s the same as if they re doing a cartoon and if we re in real life Right so that leads to problems that we have with profiling for example Putting people on one side or yes It doesn t really relate to the article but I was watching a movie with my mom and I don t know what it was called but there s this like I guess class project or oral presentation that someone had to do and this girl chose to write about her religion which she was Muslim and she wrote about like 9 11 and she was like Just because they did that doesn t mean we re all evil And like I don t know she had all this stuff and then the principal like told the FBI or something and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from Just because of that That s it That s when like a school needs to teach acceptance That s not the end Or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance Everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber and like Go kill yourself or Are you gonna bomb all of us And we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion I remember when I was in sixth grade there was a girl she was Muslim and people used to throw markers at her and stuff and call her a terrorist It was around 9 11 and stuff like that and it used to like upset me because I used to feel really bad Because she like didn t do anything she barely even knew how to talk They d like throw markers at her and stuff just because she was Muslim Like because like no one has acceptance like no one learns that it s just like people make inferences like Oh man it s a bad person so let s stay away let s shy away let s make fun of them instead of like when you re going down the street and just like we were talking about earlier how there s like if you see a big black man you re gonna put your phone away you re going to take your phone out and try to call your mom put her on speed dial You don t have acceptance either Like you may say we should get it but you don t have it It s just the way we grow up We don t suspend judgment You don t suspend judgment It s difficult to do so There is this conflict between acceptance and our values Because the values that we have that think by this individualistic view of what it is and in doing so you divide people into groups and construct images about those people and it s as simple as reading a children s story okay or as watching or turning the TV on in the morning and just watching the Disney Channel or Noggin or Nick Jr or whatever There s messages that we impart on our children there s messages that we impart on ourselves Or picking up the newspaper I don t know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper but there is a big there s a dichotomy between how different areas are described Immediate areas our city compared to our surrounding areas Right so media is biased They re systemically biased okay There is no democracy but here is the fundamental thing as an American we pride ourselves in democracy we pride ourselves in leadership so what do you do What path do you follow How do you

run and kick This is the one that s kinda tricky Y all remember this one You gotta know which direction to go in Four balls going in a circle Is Jessie going first Alright Alright last one Last event You guys remember this one right Run and kick you re gonna start Start right here in the middle alright Arrows going to number one first When I say go I start the clock Fast as you can run up to this ball Just pass it through those two cones Then we re gonna go this way following the arrows to number two Same thing pass it through those cones Number three pass it through these cones Then to number four pass it through those cones And as soon as you kick that ball the clock stops Alright Remember you don t have to hit it real hard on these Just kick it easy nice and soft and aim it between those cones Jessie you re the first one up You ready Start on that arrow in the middle and I ll say go On your mark get set go Boom alright Go faster if you can I know you can go faster than that There you go There you go Alright You wanna get that one right there Jessie Taylor can you get that ball Colin you get that ball right there We re gonna set em up and go again Alright Taylor You wanna go next Ok Yeah you can do that if you want That d be great Thank you Colin you ready to go after Taylor Alright Taylor are you ready Ready On your mark get set go Boom perfect Beautiful Awesome Terrific Good job Get that ball for me Good job Taylor Aim it right in there nice and soft Thank you for getting that ball Colin I don t know are you Is it my turn 
 You re totally fine So you guys will be using I m assuming a meter tape Yeah For measurements And then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we re good Strength versus strength qualifies ten times Ok so I like that you re making everyone go clockwise everyone s doing ten alright And then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot Ok There s a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on No shoes on ok perfect You guys are good Ok so wingspan what are your units you guys are measuring in Centimeters and you re going tip to tip right And then what was the ability again They ll take their shoes off try to touch their toes And then we ll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot Ok good In what units Centimeters Centimeters Did you say take shoes off or no Yeah Ok cool You guys can start collecting data I ll come back to you Ok what do you guys got Same thing we got yesterday Recap me Hair color You were hair color Why the hell don t you have something else I don t know Ok so here s my question Cause I was thinking about this last night You re gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data How would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color Ok so you re gonna assign numbers numeric data to shades Zero to ten Or one to ten One to ten Yeah One being the lightest The lightest lightest We should probably get this straightened out before we do it right And then ten being the darkest Ok before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm Draw a line out so I could see where you re getting your number data And then what is your characteristic That was your characteristic What is your ability How many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet Ok so we ll probably do that in the hallway Does that sound fine Meter tapes are up there That s a lot of guys So give me a real quick scale then you guys can start Ok One and ten So that s blonde and really blonde And like really dark brown So where would red fall in Like me Like right there So you re gonna make blonde one end The low end are we all in agreeance on that Yeah and mine is like in the middle Ok and then the other far end s gonna be the darkest brown Yeah Or black Or black Are you gonna have everyone taking data on that Or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color You know what I mean so there s not a ton of variation Measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger And then hopping on one foot right On your tiptoe Or no balance balance And then once your heel touch into the ground it s done And your hands can do whatever you want Ok are we shoe on shoe off Shoe off Shoe off and is it right or left foot Right foot for everybody Ok Right foot shoe off on tiptoe Max two minutes Max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground Or their other foot Or their other foot So it could be either or Okeydoke So just a kind of a flashback to remind us This has been a couple daytime span here Our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil So as we work through this unit we re gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past We ve been specifically as I ve said before looking at one specific fossil foot fossil length right The idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together we start to get a clear image of what s going on Again our goal was to determine if there s a relationship between the characteristic you chose the ability you chose and a person s foot fossil I asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit That could be an indirect relationship a direct one a trend or no relationship What I m gonna ask you to do for a minute talk to your neighbors Compare your data Make sure we re on the same page in determining a relationship And then I d like you to come up and post your data It s gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data So for example if group one what was your characteristic For fossil length Hand spans We re gonna put characteristic on the left side so they re gonna right hand span for us And then what type of relationship did you guys see for that Direct Direct so all you re gonna do is do this That s all we need to report Ok in your lab packet you are going to find some little graphs You re gonna be asked to record everyone s data I ve also given you a supplementary sheet cause you re gonna need more graphs I messed up and didn t tell you So what s gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here You will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you ll be looking at everyone s data and drawing conclusions ok So take a minute to talk to your groups I ll come around and give you some markers Determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are Post them on the board and then we ll talk No Can you determine it No Cause they re not They re just kind of clustered It was like more not clustered Ok so we re gonna have a trend fall in between where I guess the trend really is between 15 and What are we lacking You know what it was 12 30 last night Fossil foot length stride length Ok so we re having a trend falling between what s our lowest Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones Ok I think that works So you re gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there Need help Ok whatcha got Would you draw a line for a trend Yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning So this person s kinda like an outlier right so let s just for argument s sake take them out Does that help clear the data up at all You could say no it s ok They re all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times Ok so we ve got a pretty wide range here right For trend we tend to see more of a skinnier range So if you look at our options it s definitely not a direct or indirect I would say based on what you showed me right Trend wise it s kind of a wide range So what would we determine what s our other option No relationship Yeah I would probably go So up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation ok Here s your marker With this one cause it s kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area But then there s also the increase Ok so here s my question That s a good question When I look at this data right If I had a pick excluding this line if I had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall where would you pick Up here Why Yeah it appears to be going this way So that would indicate that you have a direct relationship It s kind of the easiest way to look at it Ok group number one Hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height What kind of relationship are we seeing here Direct so the bigger the foot fossil the bigger the hand span So just to clarify hand span we re talking tip of thumb to tip of finger Correct Why do we see that So I asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section so you might want to turn to that page everyone cause you wanna gather some ideas here Why are we seeing this Why do you think we re seeing that relationship What did you guys say Because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size You re not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands Usually Ok So I have a question for everyone in class I bought some new shoes and I like them Do you like them They re so big on you They re a little loud Don t worry I won t wear them on testing days They look good What s the problem here They re like way too big like twenty sizes too big How do you know Why do you know that my foot s not this big Yeah it doesn t look proportional to my body And exactly what Megan said bodies in general are proportional Now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long really lanky arms Or you might know someone that has extremely long legs They re kind of fitting outside that pattern But in general bodies are proportionate right And so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics right Because of this idea that we are proportioned You re not gonna see Shaquille O Neal wearing a size three shoe He ll fall over He wouldn t be able to support his own body Common sense applies here That s a good one Jump height So you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there s no indirect or direct relationship Why do you think we saw that Jump height is an ability versus Ok jump height is an ability you are correct It depends on muscles versus structure Ok so it s depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot I remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high I could jump in itself so I guess with your foot depending on what size shoe you have that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body By having them reach guys What was your point When you set up your lab Cause I remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you re gonna have them make a mark and then they re gonna jump Well it s so that the taller people didn t just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them Cause then it s already the distance like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are Ok So you re saying that by measuring the height you factored that idea in So Mr Bieber isn t totally outjumping say Adrian who s a little bit shorter So you already kind of factored that in Why did we not see a connection though Megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe opposed to foot Cause everybody kind of jumped the same There wasn t any variation So it didn t really matter what foot size you have Ok So when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly They found the same general area in that same general pattern That s why theres a trend It was all in just one spot So in general when we re looking at fossils would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil No Probably not Which kind of makes sense anyway Group two Group two didn t get their data plotted but let s take a peek They did foot fossil length and height If you were to make an assumption if there was a relationship what would you all assume would be the relationship Direct why direct Cause it s proportional Bingo bodies are proportional You re gonna see that pattern as we work through this Proportional ok Average stride We didn t really get a graph but it didn t look very direct It was a little more indirect More indirect I think so Like this So you re saying longer No no Like there wasn t really a pattern Oh so your e saying no relationship Yeah Does that make sense Alana says no I saw this Why Well just based on the proportional idea if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs So you re arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship I think a direct You would say direct Claire and then Barrett Well cause we had the same thing but a little bit different And well backwards It couldn t really be that accurate because it wasn t a very long distance and people had different ideas of walking Some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower It wasn t just like an average So you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct But you re saying you agree that we should see direct No we should see an indirect An indirect Longer leg shorter strides Direct Longer legs longer strides But you re arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn t lend itself to collect proper data Yeah Ok good point I think it was also just I was asked just to walk like I normally do and I don t take very long strides I kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when I just normally walk Ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am I supposed to walk So maybe we could have captured it in a different manner We could have designed the experiment if you re already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride I think no relationship is accurate because my stride length I would assume is based on how long my legs are I have very long legs but everybody knows I have a small foot I mean I m still proportional like I m normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else Ok so you re kinda arguing that maybe you re not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional There was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides It was kind of just all over the place Ok So what are we labeling this Direct question mark no relationship question mark If we re basing it on the data that they had I d say no relationship Ok if we re basing it on the data even though we didn t plot it Looking at their actual data we would say no relationship Could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship Yes So for our data collection we ll leave no relationship But keeping in mind that very valid point that if you re gonna have longer feet more than likely you have longer legs More than likely you re gonna take longer strides But inherent as Claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment that maybe that didn t shine through Group three Hair color versus foot fossil length No relationship Is this shocking to anyone Yes Even though they had a great numeric scale Why Why no relationship Bubs I didn t have anything to do with it It s like a gene base Hair color is determined by Your DNA Does your DNA determine your foot length Yes it does But not the same gene Ok but not the same gene Ok now you re getting very technical I appreciate that Yes sir I think its partially because Would you think that there would be a connection Like smaller foot lighter hair Well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity Some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others Ok so maybe you re arguing the sample size The idea that we were to survey globally maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller would have different I could see that Yeah Well I think it has nothing to do with it because I m six feet tall and Franco s under five feet and we both have dark hair So obviously Yeah it s got nothing to do with it Ok so on face value looking at hair color Would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color No Ok I would agree There s no connection there No connection My question though is There are organisms that lived in the past And we have very I would say We have certain ideas about what their coloring was like How would we come up with that then How would scientists come up with that idea Of the coloring of certain organisms Caroline Well if you say that lizards would be or dinosaurs would be green it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don t know for sure So you re thinking evolutionary connection It ll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment Yeah Yes Claire I think you also said a few days ago About how you re supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now So if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now Ok so again you re doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color possibly due to some benefit we can assume in the past Good nice job 
 So does percent always have to be 100 No Because I see none of the percents up here are 100 They re all lower than 100 So you think a percent can either be 100 or less Yes Okay okay So that means you think this can be called an improper Okay Ian Three fourths and the decimal 0 75 are the same What do you mean by the same One s a decimal one s a fraction Well I mean like they re equivalent Ah Equivalent So does that go back to what Alana said Alana which ones did you have there One half and 5 So you re saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with one half and 5 10 Yeah Okay Alana no Well I did one fourth three fourths 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters Ah you did one fourth what was the other one One Wait one fourth three fourths All right 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters Ah Okay quarters I can think of money Quarters Or Yeah 25 cents 75 cents Yeah 25 cents is one quarter 75 cents is three quarters Three quarters one quarter Excellent Good good Ian Everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal Oooh So you found a way to connect every single one of them So everything can be made into Say it again A percent fraction or decimal Interesting So you re saying that I can take this percent and write it as a just a percent Or as a What else Fraction and decimal So okay he s connecting all He thinks all three of them can become equivalent From the views before Excellent Ian Six fourth one fourth and three fourth they all have a denominator of four Ah yeah What does that mean that they all have a denominator of four Well they re all like sets of fourths What does a denominator represent in a fraction The um bottom number When we write it as the bottom number when we re literally writing it what does it actually represent What s that for How many equal parts it s split into Ah the number of equal parts it s split into So let me go back to Ian Ian is saying that everything can be written as also as a fraction a decimal and a percent So can everything be in four parts What if it s in five parts Does that matter I can do the five parts as a percent or I can do four parts as a percent Yeah What about what Alan said Percent is it up to a hundred and that s it No depends on the range that you set it So can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100 Well like when something you did in Earth Science we did to see if our grow dino grew over 600 Good connection Okay So what did that mean if it grew over 600 It like grew bigger than times Over six hundred times its size Yeah 600 times its size Okay So is it possible so is that an improper percent No but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100 meybe we can t go over 100 What happened here You tell me about that percent It s less than one percent Is that possible Can you think of a real life example when you d have less than one percent about growing something expanding over and over to 600 times its size Can you give a real life example of when I would have 0 When you fail a test Oh Well I could fail a test with 64 What does it mean if I fail a test with 0 Other than I m in big trouble at home What does it mean What would that mean if you failed it with 0 What would that mean about what you did on the test You didn t get anything right Yeah you got zero right nothing right Didn t get a single question right Can it be less than zero Is this less than zero Yeah No It s less than one So where is zero here Tenths is that zeros No Where s zeros Between Where would they go Would they go in the ones place tens place Ones In the ones place We have zero ones So is this less than zero Yes No No No because it s 0 1 Interesting okay So can I have less than zero percent No You can have a negative but If it s negative percent Can you have a negative percent What do you think Well I was going to say something could be like one point like point one percent less than something if you re comparing two things Okay your percent of increase or decrease have you looked at that in Earth Science yet Standard deviation Okay We ll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase decrease I m talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent And whether that s below one or zero Okay so can you give an example of where this could occur Where I can have less than 1 It can occur I think with that fraction Okay but that s just a made up Can you give me something in real life that I could have less than 1 You can have an example of more than 100 So my question is does percent go from 100 to one or zero or is there anything less in between What do you think Like a gas tank in your backyard Okay Like when you call in to get it filled and it s really low The meter s low and under one Okay that s typically not going to be measured in percent it s going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank it s going to be a volume situation Oh Okay but we ll talk about that So let s keep that in mind We re still trying to find an example when we have less than 1 Think of one Alice Like on the labels and stuff on the vitamins less than 1 of your recommended day or something I just so happen to have here vitamins You re right And there are some examples when if I take this I m not going to get my daily 1 I m going to get less than that But there s some of these in here ooh like if I take one of these I get 100 of vitamin C Now I drank a glass of orange juice this morning when I took my vitamin What happened to the percent of vitamin C Where s it at It went over 100 Over 100 So there s a real life when I can get over 100 of something Anybody get over 100 on a quiz or test ever Over And how do you get that Bonus Ah bonus questions So we re good with coming up with more than 100 But we re still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it s less than one percent So we ll go back to that Any other connections Let s see if we can connect the ones we haven t done yet Anything with the leftover ones One fifth and 20 are equal Okay Box right there They re equivalent to each other right How did you know they were equivalent Because one fifth of 100 is 20 Okay she did one fifth of 100 because we think of again we keep going back to a hundred for 100 is 20 out of 100 Excellent What else One tenth and 10 Ah what can you say about one tenth and 10 They re equivalent Again equivalent Going to go back to Ian Ian they re finding the percent and the decimal but there s no fraction there Fraction with a percent but there s no decimal Is there a third for all of them You said there s an equivalent fraction decimal percent for all of them No But there can be The decimal would be So what would you like to add here Ian Let s go to the which one You pick one Find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we re missing Well 150 and six fourths is equal Okay Do we think they equal each other No Yeah Yeah Convincing but not yet you haven t convinced everybody Do you think that equals Okay four fourths would equal 100 And one fourth each fourth is 25 and if it s two over then I ve got two fourths left over And that d be 50 And they can also equal 0 5 So now we need the decimal piece 1 5 What did you say Alan Uh two fourths can equal 0 5 So what do you think six fourths give me the decimal that I ll put here We agree that these are equal 1 5 Oh so there is a decimal that goes there How d you get 1 5 Oh because one and a half Got it See where the half came from You said Ruby you had told us that one half and five tenths were equal So if we have that one half here we do the same thing we combine it here to get the 50 Okay So any others What s the missing piece Ian Uh you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like another Well pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece One in one thousands One thousandths One thousandths and 0 1 Ah Are these equivalent No Yes No You re going to have to convince them Ian It s the day of Ian convincing I don t know They are Why do you say they are Because one percent over a hundred Well because that s tenth that s not thousandths It s not one tenth it s one tenth of a percent So here s another question then Are those equivalent No No So be careful That s not one tenth that s one tenth of a percent So could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one thousandths Yes Yeah but when you divide it by 100 Ah so we keep hearing divide and multiply by a hundred so when I convert from a percent to a decimal or percent to a fraction I m using powers of what Ten Ten So the question is Is that the equivalent to that Yeah How do you want to do it Ava Um Can you fill in the missing piece Can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here with a missing decimal that I have I have the percent and I have the fraction but we think we re going to get all three of them Can you tell me what decimal that is Um zero and one thousandth How did you get that Um divide by 100 Ah Dividing by 100 What do you notice happens when we divide by 100 It goes back Okay when we divide it It moves two decimal places And the decimal place moves two places over So did that happen So are we convinced that these three are now equal Yes Can we see that now But you divide 0 1 you divide it by a hundred to get Oh yes you re changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that Okay Yeah Now that Ava gave us the decimal is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other Yes Because now you when you read that you read it as what One and one one thousandths So are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction decimal percent for every fraction every decimal and every percent Yes So why do we have all three Why not do everything in fractions do everything in percents or do everything in decimals Why do we have in real life all three things going on Alice Because for some things it s easier to picture it in percent in decimal Okay so picturing a visual to go with it can you think of an example of one we use or in real life Well like with money It s like easier to think that it s going to be 25 cents or 0 25 than like 25 of a dollar Yeah wouldn t that be interesting if they said how much is that salad today Well it s something percent of a dollar Okay Ian Well with fractions one third is equal to 0 333 and keep going Ah so if we did with fractions or decimals we might have some repeating 
 Okay alright Okay okay So that s his position He s going to stick with it for a minute but then he might have to go around he might change his mind alright Okay This group agreed with Fernando okay That it s because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter Who would like to share they re thinking I ll call on you if you don t So what do you think Well I think it s because since the Earth like orbits around the sun like in an oval when it gets here it would be warmer because it s closer to the sun Okay And it s winter when it s away from the sun Okay So can you go and draw that on the board what you mean Because I heard you say that the Earth orbits around the sun in the shape of an oval Raise your hand if you agree with that Okay Okay Okay So that s the Earth and it s orbiting around the sun and he said that the shape of the path that it travels as it orbits is an oval okay Anybody else in this group has something to add to help him defend Fernando Okay I see Can I read what you wrote Sure He said that the orbit is not a perfect circle So that s sort of what he s saying there Is that right Yeah And how would it not being a perfect circle affect the difference in summer winter temperature or heat Well we know that the Earth if it was a perfect circle the seasons wouldn t change Okay It would be the same Alright Okay Depending where the Earth is Alright okay Anybody else have something they want to add in this group Okay Now anybody based on these two groups Anybody want to move from their group to these two groups Not yet Okay that s alright Okay Now let s go to Raul okay This group agrees with Raul and he says it s because the Earth s tilt changes the angle of the sunlight hitting the Earth Defend yourselves So I remember learning that the tilt of the axis is the reason for the seasons But I read the question again it says the Earth still changes and if it doesn t change it stays the same Okay Let s read it again Read it really simple It says it s because the Earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight hitting Earth Okay So it says the Earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight Yeah Does it say it changes the tilt of the Earth No Okay So you going to stick with what you said or you want to change Can you show me If I give you something can you show me what you mean Alright Okay So I m going to give you an apple and I want you to pretend it s the Earth okay And I m going to stick this bamboo skewer through it well it didn t go exactly right but just pretend So what does this represent based on what you just said This is the axis of the Earth So this is the axis and what does the axis do Okay So the Earth rotates around the axis which is what Ryan said right Okay And be careful because I just poked myself I want you to be careful Okay So can you stand up and show me what you mean and let s have someone else in your group that agrees with you be the sun and stand kind of in the middle of the room right here okay Alright So she s the sun you re the Earth show us what you mean okay Okay Well the Earth orbits the sun Alright What s the word you were just about to say though Revolves I think that might be okay too What do you guys think Do you think revolve and orbit might be the same Yeah Okay alright It doesn t matter Okay so you re going to have to make the Go around the outside of the desk for your orbit okay Well it orbits the sun in a tilt Okay Which one is tilt I forgot how many degrees Okay Alright okay So keep going It orbits in an angle Alright Hold it the way you think it s supposed to be Okay I think it s this one I m pretty sure Alright So she s tilting it but now and it s tilted Right now it s away from the sun is that right Yeah Okay Now keep coming around Of course does it make a little job to play that No But we re just imagining those who were in this room Okay Now stop there for a minute Is your axis pointing where you want it to Yes Okay alright Keep going You guys need to make space for her to come through on her orbit Okay alright So does that help some of you How many people think that she s right That the Earth tilts as it s going around its orbit It s actually kind of spinning on its axis while it s going around right Is that right Yeah It s spinning the whole time right What does that spinning give us What does that spinning give us Day and night The spinning gives us day and night okay Right Okay Because one side of the Earth is facing the sun it s what Day And the other side is in Night Okay alright Okay alright This group over here You guys agree with Susan Susan okay And Susan said that she thinks it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in summer than in winter So what do you think So like she said that its axis is tilting but as it moves around the sun the northern and southern hemisphere are closer and farther away Okay But on this side the southern hemisphere is closer Alright And when it comes over here the northern hemisphere is closer in the sun and Alright Anybody else in this big room have something to add Well I agree with her Natalie Because as it is tilted I believe that and so when it goes around the sun shines bright and as it s turning and so as it goes around it will change where the light is hitting it Okay Can someone add to that or give us more detail I m also pretty sure that like the state of Texas it s more closer towards the equator and so it doesn t have all of the seasons Okay So you think that places on the equator right here they don t have four seasons Summer fall winter right I think they do have seasons they re just not as different as like Okay So there s not much that difference in the heat from the sun and the winter versus the summer Yeah I think they re always getting the same amount depending on The same amount of what The same amount of sunlight and heat Because they re getting it directly almost Okay Alright Why do you think that What makes you say that So you think the orbit is elliptical like this group Fernando s group agreed But it s not enough to change the difference in temperature I don t think heat really varies depending on I mean it varies but not in that small of a scale depending on where it is And so just that little teeny movement ellipse or something will not change Okay alright Okay I think we have another group over here How about the Shakira agree ers Do you want to move now Okay Okay Everybody if you want to move to a different table go for it now okay Nobody agreed with Warner huh Okay So Eva s out alright People don t think that it gives off more heat right in the summer than the winter in Warner s group right So we re down to And Shakira s out right Alright Who said to me that they didn t agree with any of them I changed my mind You changed your mind Okay Alright So here s what I want you to do now okay I want to do another little demonstration okay Would you be the sun Okay And would you be the Earth Now here s what I want you to do for me I want you to orbit around the sun I want you to pick a spot Like let s say that yellow bucket okay And as you re going around I want you to keep the axis pointed at that yellow bucket no matter where you are Can you do that Yes Alright Give it a try Alright Alright Now stop for a second right there Okay He s still pointed at that yellow bucket right Keep going Alright stop right there He s still pointed pretty much at the yellow bucket and you re tilted over a little bit right Like she said Because we all kind of agree pretty much These two groups agreed with that What season is it right now In the northern hemisphere What season is it right now in the northern hemisphere Winter Winter Why is it winter in the northern hemisphere Because it s farther away from the sun Okay So it s pointing away from the sun right Do you think it s because the northern hemisphere is farther away No because it s tilted away Tilted away Yeah Okay Alright keep coming around here now Keep pointing at the yellow bucket It s a little bit hard to do huh Okay stop right there What season is it right now Would it be spring Perhaps It would be spring in the northern hemisphere What is it in the southern hemisphere Fall Okay So it s the opposite right Okay keep coming around here Alright keep pointing at the yellow bucket Now what season is it in the northern hemisphere What season is it in the northern hemisphere now This group over here Somebody in this group the table What is it Summer Summer Why is it summer in the northern hemisphere Because it s closer to the sun Closer to the sun And it s like kind of like Are we like a few hundred or thousand miles away from the sun A few hundred or a few thousand Or like a few million Yeah Okay So in the scope of that it s hard to picture do you think that the distance between this spot and this spot is that much compared to the sunlight coming over Yeah To make it that different Okay So you think it s more the tilt Exactly Okay I m not sure in your past science classes what is it about heat energy and light energy pointed on something that makes something warmer or colder Anybody have an idea Depending on how direct it is because what I was thinking is like if this is the sun and can I come up Come show us So if my pencil s the heat and the light it would be coming from here and it would be coming and it would hit with him this one more Right And this one will be direct Okay So I think what he s saying is that both the northern and southern hemisphere are still getting sun aren t they Yes Because we re so far away that the only which side of the Earth is not getting sun right this minute This side When it s rotating it s night time But during the day is it still pretty much light in the northern and southern hemisphere Yeah Yeah So what he s saying is that it s more direct to the hemisphere that s tilted right toward the sun It s still getting sun and somebody over here said something about the equator the places on the equator Those over there Who said that Say that again Like states or I m not sure Any locations right So like for Texas as an example I m not sure if it s exactly on the equator but I know it s really close to the equator Okay Closer than we are Yeah Okay I just read somewhere that it doesn t have all of the seasons Okay Yeah Somebody else said I think as much difference or variation Yeah Okay So this is summer in the northern hemisphere Now we re going to cut across our orbit and save time go back over to that side and what season was that again Winter What season was that again What season is it now in the northern hemisphere Winter okay So which hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight now The southern hemisphere And what season is it now in the southern hemisphere Summer Summer okay Alright Because the heat s having to go around Okay So let s go back for a second Raul s group said it s because the tilt doesn t change but the tilt as you re going around changes the angle of the sunlight that s hitting the Earth okay That s Raul s group You guys still agree with that Yeah Okay And Susan s group said it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in the summer than it is in the winter Anybody want to move groups now Wait Does that mean more direct or Well Or literally closer Literally closer Okay Anybody want to move groups Okay That s okay You don t have to change alright And this group with Fernando that is because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter Alright I m going to show you something and I m going to see if it changes your mind okay Do we get to eat the apples afterwards Well we ll see okay Alright Okay So take a look up here Alright This is a simulation What do I mean by a simulation You can come back and sit down with your group What do I mean by a simulation It s a photo or a video of what actually Right It s not out in the universe looking back at our Earth It s not from the space station or anything like that okay So take a look Alright And look at what s happening with the axis It s a little bit hard to see on the screen Okay Did you notice how like what we tried to do It stayed pointing the same direction right Let s do it one more time Okay alright Okay Now does this look kind of like what he drew on the board at the beginning Does it look like an ellipse Yeah Or an oval Yeah Okay So I wish I had a glass a clear glass We do right over there We have a clear glass That s alright We can use this Okay There is one over there We can use this Okay I want you and you re looking at this kind of from the side Does it look like that When you re looking at the rim of this cup or the rim of this glass from the sort of the side does it look like an oval Yes Yeah Okay Let me make sure you can see that It does doesn t it When you re looking at it from that angle But look at it straight down now What does it look like A circle It looks like a perfect circle Let s let a couple people experience that Look at it from the side now look at it straight down With this one you re almost looking you re looking like right here Okay So the glass it was right there I want you guys to try it too okay Alright It might But what I want you to think about here is this is sort of what you guys probably saw in your fifth grade science books maybe even in your middle school science books We ll have to take a look at the pictures in our books You know publishers the people who print the books they don t always do things the right way for us to work And do you know that there are many hundreds and thousands of adults maybe millions of adults who think that the orbit of the Earth looks like this because this is what they saw in their science books when they were kids growing up But just like the glass what happens I m going to do it again but I m going to flip it over We re looking at it from up above So look what s happening now It s a circle Yeah And did you know that the Earth s orbit it is slightly an oval but so slightly that it s really close to a perfect 
 Scientist number two I want to know what your question is what is your variable that you re isolating and what are you measuring You guys ready Okay so table two Or table one Our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes even after they ve been rinsed And our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used and the dependent variable is how they changed from before when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them Cool and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain Tomorrow We also were planning on taking pictures from before and after so we could like compare those So you may want to do a scale like Marley did with the intensity of her hair dye as well okay But get it set up today make it really controlled with all your measurements and just change the type of oil Alright scientists do you have any Our experiment is we re going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges Okay using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water I don t know I read your document I don t know what the positively charged particles you are but did you work it out Okay so what s your question then Our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum Okay does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls them coming together scum balls Okay good Table three what s your question Um how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water like using what we re going to use mainly olive oil and toilet paper Okay Perfect And testing the independent variable is testing how long we re going to stir How long it takes to make scum and then our dependent variable we re going to take the observations of time Okay so the question is how long does it take to form scum balls Independent variable is the stir time and the dependent variable is the How long it takes How long it takes to do it Uh huh What are you going to measure though We re going to actually try to measure the surface area of the Cool so you re going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time Okay that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot Okay table four what s your question How does temperature affect the oil and water How does temperature affect the oil and water Awesome And we re trying to figure out how it will separate How can you separate it What are you changing in the experiment We re changing we re going to use regular temperature and put it on a Bunsen burner and put it in the freezer Cool and you re more than welcome to use the freezer in the back Good idea Alright table five what s your question Does heat affect the scum ball Does heat affect the scum ball And our independent s going to be amount of scum and the amount of water and the dependent s going to be heat Okay so your independent now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever so your independent is really going to be temperature So I feel like you have two independent variables Why don t you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate Is it the amount of water and the amount of scum Or is it temperature Okay We were going to change the temperature Then keep the amount of water and the scum constant Because you can t do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures It means you re testing for two different things While you could do that it s two experiments and we don t have time today So just one experiment Alright table six So our central question is is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes Okay And our independent variable was the amount of oil And the dependent was the shape Okay so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes Independent variable is the amount of oil or scum dependent variable is the shapes While I m over here I just want to draw your attention to the back of the room That is the waste beaker which has scum on top of it right now It s every kind of oil that Copper used yesterday So if you want pre made scum I encourage you to use Copper s waste from yesterday So the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water But the top portion of it is just that less dense oily scum okay Alright table seven what s your question It s can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter Okay So we re trying two different types of oil and we re going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container Okay and you may need to use two of the same identical filters so just make sure you re really consistent with your measurements between those two filters Good Alright I m excited about their project because Copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting So check back in with this group later on if you want to see what s going on with the filters And table eight what s your central question Does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water Does oil collect the most what Does oil collect the most of each thing Oh the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water Okay so you re going to look and see what it attracts And what are some of the materials you re going to use Dirt sand and pebbles Dirt sand and pebbles awesome So your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract How are you going to measure those results Mass Mass Okay cool You may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass If you get too big it won t measure on our balances Which brings me to my next topic which is safety talk Conservation of materials Did you guys get a lecture yet No because Sam is too busy with her Why don t you go over there and see what they re doing Go talk to her Thank you Alright lady scientists What s going on We re like I thought that we didn t need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn t have enough time so we just did the small amount and then the larger Amount Okay Now that we did the middle speed we re actually seeing a lot different stuff because the balls are actually coming together That underneath and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top Okay And this is thicker than that one Okay let me get another group over here because they re also trying to form a scum ball and I d like them to see your results Terrence and Catherine and Maddy can you guys pause and come and check out this group s experiment I don t see scum It makes me mad Ooh this is so cool Why does it look like that I want it to look like that Come on over These guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls Can you guys talk about what s your independent variable What are you changing We re just changing the different speeds Okay and Yasmine what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three The dirt oil and the water Okay and they used the black potting soil dirt Is it the peat moss In the plastic bag That s peat moss Okay good And Taylor it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom what s that Don t know Can you guys fill her in Toilet paper Toilet paper which makes sense because there s a lot of toilet paper over there Okay and so far your results have been they ve just done the high speed and the low speed right And they re like oh it s the same nothing happened nothing happened right They came back today and this is the medium speed and what s going on A lot of dirt balls are actually coming down and forming together Because they were all little pieces of dirt and now they re making big globs of dirt And that s weird So does time sitting overnight have anything to do with it That s what we talked about with these two Actually this one because and this one too because we didn t see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one And then this one I just noticed that it s actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil Okay are the highs and the lows working the speeds yet Have you tried to re run the highs and the lows today No Re run the highs and lows you have a good seven six minutes See if they start to form clump balls Not sure if you can use this one Can I go get a funnel Sure There s one on the table I am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not If you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything or you could leave it how it is It s your choice Got about seven minutes okay Thank you Yes cool Hey you guys have some diesel fuel on your table Any information research observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome The three of you all together Alright so We got 97 no 47 94 for all of them Okay let me put the camera on you four Ready Let s talk about it Is that okay Okay so you isolated your variable different types of oil You made everything the same same size same amount of water same amount of soap time soaking everything was super controlled right Okay and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board Yeah it was 47 94 like it jumped between them two numbers constantly None of them like Consistent so it was consistent Alright so any initial conclusions Yes I said that since all the things were like a darker color and the oils were kind of close I guess in like how they felt and what color they were I guess that maybe if we used a white shirt maybe there would ve been a difference because it would ve soiled it more Do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric Yes Yes okay alright Let me hear your conclusions and then I m going to This one that had water on it is different looking than this one like the material looks more like Like dry or something right So there s some qualitative difference I know that this one needs to be flipped over Because then it s the same side of the fabric Okay so water That one s whiter Lighter okay so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking And your control This one is darker Your control was the same as all of them The 47 94 Okay And you Any conclusions yet Um I don t know I kind of think the sand thing is sand because I know the one we put on the paper like it went all the way down to 40 something so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was Okay and Lauren what was your central question My central question The central question of your experiment Oh it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there How much of it was still there Okay or if it would affect the fabrics differently Okay but your light probe is saying no they re all the same so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever Should I take that as data I think you should take it as data yeah And it s okay you addressed your question which was how does oil affect it different among shirts In your case with the soap maybe not at all differently I d like you to try one more thing involving paper towels And what you re going to do is you re going to see you re going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there s any oil that s absorbed on the paper towels okay So that can be one other way to take data To see if there s still any oil still stuck in the shirts Okay Okay Goggles on Goggles on Goggles on What s the highest temperature we could put it at Are you guys boiling You can put it all the way up you just have to be really cautious Get your Hot Hands out the big glove Alright Heather s group I m coming over to you guys Ready Okay what s going on over here We put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt Okay ooh Salt when I was a waitress we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out Maybe you could put a second Wait that s kind of like clay I was going to say flour because that s what we do if I spill What do you notice It s starting to kind of clump When we had the clay it was really really clumpy but then it It the uh Yeah like the clay just clumped And then we had to get before and that didn t really make a difference it just sat at the bottom My hands are sticky Oh thank you While you re here do you remember the charge of the particles of clay Positive or negative Negative Okay so negatively charged particles and now you ve added sodium chloride which dissolves in water You ve got an A plus positive CL minus negative And you re clearly getting a scum ball No What happens when you turn it off It just all settles at the top When we put clay in there for the first time it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top But nothing of the magnitude So that motion really helps it to stay together Yeah that s what we did We put it at 500 RPMs first and then we dialed it back down to 100 Let s apply this to the water treatment plant Was there motion at the water treatment plant Yes Was there clay in the water Probably From where From the sediment on the bottom of the Schuylkill From the sediment on the river Now remember the stuff that s going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home so it hasn t had a chance to go in the Schuylkill River yet Okay Would there be any clay in the homes Not in the homes no Not in the homes Not in anything flushed down the toilet Yeah So yeah there could be some like clay like sediment sand particles going through Or at the very least we could say that there s probably some negatively charged particles going through some kind of silicates Shall we throw away the fabric Sure Who knows what s in feces right Alright so what I think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form Have you talked about CeCe s experiment yet No Go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed Also Matt Ian s sorry Catherine s station is using sand specifically and I forget what the other material is It looks like peat moss and they re having no success So go ahead and do a little quick walk around And clean up Motion Can you let them give them a 10 second overview Yeah And then go Taylor pull it together you ll be okay You re good Okay Did you get any scum No we didn t we just got into lumps The fastest way we got a layer and then everything the soil settled on the bottom And then for the middle speed it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in Clean up clean up 
 Also causing habitat loss Anyways Indirectly through our use of C02 emissions It says that It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and we want to keep that right We want to keep it naturally occuring we just wanna work on our Levels Yeah Because our impact is not exactly natural It s not like we re trying to stop the unhuman related processes Just like what we re doing to increase it Because like it s been staying at a level until we started releasing a bunch of CO2 and then it went up so it s kind of obvious that we re the cause of that So I don t think it s going to go down then what it was before normally Yeah I think it s highly unlikely that this would ever happen Yeah and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius is a lot too I highly doubt this would happen If we reduce the CO2 emissions in what we re doing this is kind of ridiculous Give some more evidence for that Why Yeah why Explain why do you feel that way Because carbon dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle yeah But we re contributing to make more of it There s so many economies and stuff that are dependent on it right now that are not going to get rid of it for a long time Therefore there wouldn t be such a drastic change in the amounts of carbon dioxide that there wouldn t be a drop of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius Because we don t plan to tamper with the natural Flow of the carbon cycle We just want to tamper with our which will take a long time anyway So we re going to be up and up and up for a while But we kind of already did tamper with the CO2 the natural ones because yeah we re trying to reduce our own personal emissions now that we re doing it now but we ve already gone in and tampered with it We ve already cut down millions and millions of trees We ve already so can we talk about I m trying to touch into what we ve done in the past and how if we kind of try and back out now then we leave the Earth in a sticky situation Does that make sense Well I do have a question I don t remember does the greenhouse effect exist naturally even as like a little bit right Yeah we just made it bigger So it s like they re claiming that without the greenhouse effect the Earth s average temperature would drop drastically well obviously because the greenhouse effect exists naturally but we re making so much of the greenhouse effect that we re trying to bring it down to normal levels We re not trying to bring it down below normal levels I think they re saying that this is going to happen if it s below the normal level but the problem is that we are already above the normal level so if we bring it down it s not going to make it a complete effect anyway I mean they are right saying that it s going to get significantly below as everyone said it s not going to be to the point where life will not exist But I mean the process by which sun penetrates the earth like some of the heat is retained because of that effect And what we re doing is enabling the Earth to retain more heat than it normally does So by releasing some of it by reducing emissions we are making the Earth much much cooler But we also can t get rid of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere So those would stay there and our temperature probably wouldn t drop as much probably still would drop maybe not as extreme And also we live in a world where we use so much carbon dioxide there s no way that we re going to get it to the level of just the natural processes I mean at least not in a ten year period I was wondering how long it thought we were going to slow so called global warming It doesn t really give us a projection I don t think we re going to have another ice age for a long time I mean we re having a mass extinction as it is the way we are right now I think if anything reducing it would help stop the mass extinction I think we ve kind of talked about all we can at this point Alright so at this point if you feel like you have talked a lot in an effort to get you to stop I m going to have you actually I want you to scoot your chair back like a foot or two for the next one to give some other people a chance to talk Yeah I have two you want the good ones with lotion The next one sorry is Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Somebody want to read Okay Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas Today Mythbusters Daily exclusively reveals what climate scientists have been hiding from the public Water vapor is actually a much more prevalent and potent greenhouse than carbon dioxide Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere between 30 000 to 40 000 ppm while maximum estimates put CO2 around 370 ppm Due to its abundance water vapor s a much more important greenhouse gas so human inputs of CO2 are negligible We should stop focusing on CO2 and refocus research and funding on reducing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere Would that be parts per million for ppm Yeah parts per million Water vapor unit really really Okay We have a whole water cycle I know we have the whole carbon cycle and everything but we have contributed so much to the carbon cycle I mean and global warming hasn t really been a problem until recently gee I wonder why Maybe because I don t know we are emitting a lot of carbon I mean it s not like we ve been emitting more water you can t create more water Okay Yeah I m done I m sorry I think if you explained what the greenhouse effect actually is it will disprove the water vapor theory Because the way the greenhouse effect works is completely unrelated with water vapor How Well because like isn t the greenhouse gas a gas that lets in sunlight but it prevents the heat from leaving or whatever or something right But water doesn t I don t think water does that I thought it was a greenhouse gas We learned about that in chapter 20 But We did it on the worksheet maybe or the thing that we had for homework last night It s considered a greenhouse gas That s all I know You know what effect it had Sorry No it is a greenhouse gas I remember reading that But You can grab a textbook if you d like Keep talking Elizabeth Water vapor has always been there It has always been at this level Am I wrong Well I mean if our CO2 emissions are increasing and global warming is happening then you would be releasing more water vapor I mean heat would cause that to happen But then technically this is an effect it s not a cause then Is it possible to be both Maybe Like a positive feedback loop What do you know about water vapor It s a greenhouse gas We know that now Isn t it when water evaporates Clouds Nope that is an excellent point Hold on you guys what do clouds do They block sunlight So if the global temperatures rise there would be more water vapor because there would be more fluctuations of creating water vapor Don t look at me look at your people And people who are on the outside are not supposed to be talking Well just like Well she can finish Sorry sorry no go ahead Go ahead finish She said you could finish Oh Okay Well when water vapor think about it when you like boil water it s hot and it creates water vapor So increases in global temperature there would be a possible connection between increased temperature and increased water vapor Hot air rises Which way would it be though Because if increasing temperature causes increase in water vapor does that mean increase in water vapor causes increase in temperature Well you said that water vapor is clouds so wouldn t clouds would block sunlight so wouldn t that decrease temperature But that s kind of like contradictory Can that happen though Like how hot air rises and cold air drops so maybe forgot what that process is called Well it s like sometimes when you re on like islands or something that it s like all cloudy but still really hot and humid so maybe it can increase the temperature I have a question At what altitude do clouds form It depends I mean they can form at ground level That s what s basically fog What s the highest altitude that clouds are going to reach For the most part like on average I have no idea that is an excellent question But like what part of their is it under the stratosphere There s a laptop over there if you guys want to get it No one s ever asked me that That s a really good question I don t know I know that they re throughout the troposphere but I m not sure how high up in the stratosphere they go That s a really good I don t know Can I read something really quick Four natural greenhouse gases in the troposphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide These gases have been present in varying concentrations in the troposphere during most of the Earth s long history Fluctuations in the troposphere concentration of these gases especially carbon dioxide and methane plus changes in solar output are the major factors causing new changes in the average temperature of the troposphere over the past 400 000 years And then it just talks about how from the beginning of the industrial revolution human actions have led to significant increases in carbon dioxide and therefore it correlates the relation to the increase in temperature of the globe I just read another thing Additional clouds can have a warming effect positively back by absorbing and releasing heat into the troposphere Or a cooling effect a negative effect by reflecting more sunlight back into space So they can have a warming effect So should we be worried about water vapor more than carbon dioxide No Why Because doesn t the CO2 cause the warming which never mind No no keep going That was good keep going That was it Okay Well based on what she just read and based on everything we know about carbon dioxide we know that carbon dioxide can lead to a lot of effects A lot of them bad And one of the major things is that it does lead to more water vapor and if water vapor is such an issue in terms of global temperature increase then you would think their first thought would be decrease carbon dioxide emissions But no Can we directly regulate water vapor No Can we directly regulate CO2 Yeah we can decrease our emissions We can switch to alternative vehicles We can find other sources of energy I mean there are a lot of options with water vapor we just have a water cycle We can t tell the water vapor to stop rising into the clouds like Yeah can you just pause for a moment No we can t do that because it s a natural cycle Are we done with that one So what do we have so far Nida Well that heat would cause the release of more water vapor and clouds can trap and release heat but they can also cool And concluded that clouds are water vapor first of all What we were saying should we worry about water vapor more so than CO2 Probably not because we can regulate CO2 but not water vapor And water s a greenhouse gas I call that using science I have a question for you In nuclear power plants how the steam comes from the cooling tower Is that water vapor emission That is considered a water vapor emission Okay so maybe we could control that aspect of it control the steam One additional thing to just sort of keep in mind and we ll talk about this later is what we call residence time Does anyone know what that is Residence time is how long a chemical stays in wherever it is And so one of the things that we re concerned about when we look at a chemical is its residence time So if we re talking about a water pollutant what s the residence time How long is it going to stay in water Is it going to break down quickly or is it going to be very persistent and is it gonna last for a really long time So when we were looking at greenhouse gases we re also looking at what s the residence time in the atmosphere How long does an average molecule stay in the atmosphere And water vapor tends to cycle in and out of the atmosphere a lot quicker than some of our other greenhouse gases Its cycles are usually on the order of days whereas others are on the order of months to years versus like do you guys know what CFCs are The ozone depleting compounds Chlorofluorocarbons we ll talk more about those as well CFCs are also a greenhouse gas but their residence time in the atmosphere is more like hundreds of years Hundreds of years to thousands of years That would be something we would be more concerned about So like the residence time of something radioactive could be like its half life Yep And then a third factor that we look at is also how potent of a greenhouse gas it is Some gases have more warming potential and some gases have less warming potential So we also want to look at what is its potential for heat trapping versus its concentration And we ll talk a little more about that too Alright we have two left I d actually like for you to pick one I m thinking maybe you should do the freezing temps one because we already kind of talked about the cloudy one but if you want to do the cloudy one you can do the cloudy one You suggest the freezing temperature one That s my suggestion but I won t be upset if you overrule me Let s do freezing temperatures Does anybody want to write

 Alright I heard the term velocity So I think that sounds pretty good Velocity of a skateboarder the more important you re going to have I like velocity Keep talking amongst yourselves I m just kind of here to guide you along Make sure the people here I don t want anyone to have their back to each other I know the room is difficult to do that but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group I know it s difficult Wait The whole class Oh yeah I want the whole class to discuss this I thought you were doing like table and table No no no I want everyone to talk Sorry Okay You guys can talk just like I talk across the room Feel free to do so So someone when we ask their velocity You need more length to the tracks Steeper You don t have to raise your hand If you re looking in that person s eye or you re looking in my eye feel free to You need a longer track Distance Is it the friction I will tell you that we re not going to look at friction as part of the system Let s look back at that proposal for one second Just want to make sure I didn t miss anything It s always good to look at what they give us Let s see What science terms are in there Quantitative Qualitative Okay Energy Oh We got energy in there Energy transfer Oh energy transfer Okay So I think they want something to do with energy It said quantitative We should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy right Do we have them Yeah We do It s half mv squared right And then What Christina said we re going to be collecting data quantitative we ll probably have to use some formula that associates with this I agree Okay Okay He gave us the formula E sub k 1 2 mv squared Energy due to the gravitational field E sub g mg Alright Let s make sure we know what each of these letters stands for M mass and the unit Kilogram G Acceleration due to gravity Lauren said force of gravity Okay You want me to write that in Which one is it Oh its the effect from the gravitational field Okay that s fine You will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force but what are the units for this Meters per second squared So that can be kind of confusing if they re calling it gravitational force and then they re saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units Acceleration Acceleration right So I m going to put acceleration due to gravity Okay Good H is height Yeah h is height And that s in Meters Sounds good Okay So now we go over here Mass and kilograms and then velocity and that s in meters per second Good And then if you remember that force doesn t like careless errors so maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units So what are the units that we re going to have for E sub g and E sub k What is it Joules Joules Oh that s right How do you remember that I m smart Okay That s good too Oh there was a pretest that had that on there That sounds good Okay Great You re taking that prior knowledge Energy is a jewel Energy is a precious jewel Alright You want precious Okay there s jewels There s semi precious and there s precious What are they diamonds and rubies So energy is a precious jewel Kilogram times a meter per second squared Newton Newton Good Newton times a meter A joule A joule Right Over here mass and kilograms Kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared don t forget the square Kilograms times a meter again is a newton Newton times a meter that s going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then multiply that by that meter and again you get joules Okay We want to make sure that we don t did everyone see how we got that joule there Meter times another meter right Yeah Because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton Times a meter remember this is meters squared because of that Oh okay Okay So you know the boss doesn t like careless errors so let s make sure that we have the appropriate units Okay I don t mean to interrupt you guys Why don t you continue with that You ve got some formulas here now For potential energy wouldn t mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants so height is the only one that that could manipulate So if the height is the greater distance from the Earth then it would have more potential energy because they re directly proportional Yes Let me ask you guys I can t help but interrupt once in a while right But I just wanted to If I put this marker on the table does this marker have potential energy What is the reference point Oh oh oh The table No The center of our planet Yes Okay So I heard a fight I think that s a good thing The more danger the more fun I thought right Yes They re going to wear their headgear Is this guy wearing any head oh he s wearing head protection Why is that important by the way So the force doesn t apply to your head Okay I like that Ah Inversely proportional right I like that yeah So it increases the amount of time decreases the force So yeah danger is an aspect here but this guy seems like he s doing okay He s got his headgear on but that s definitely if you re designing a park you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren t going to be injured There are going to be accidents with skateboards but they ll wear their gear I m going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier Okay So how high do we want the If we want it to have a bigger potential energy transferring the bigger kinetic energy we might want to have the height from the reference point which is the ground and kind of higher I heard reference point Let me see if I can put a reference point on this I did just put a little click a button and get the reference point okay I think the thing should be on the ground Yeah The weight s like it s safer and it s possible Do you want me to just to extend the We ve got a couple of things going on here I m sorry A couple people said yes they wanted me to put that on the ground So if those people could say that again that would be great Say that again You want to put it on the ground And I think I heard a dissenting voice in the crowd Someone that said something else I did Oh okay I said that if you increase the height it s still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side technically you d be able to go back and forth They haven t brought in the supports for this herculean innovation That s right I mean I don t think it really is going to affect the design structure so Whether it s on the ground or I ll just pull that down That s fine Yeah I don t think that s going to make a difference That might make it easier for the person to step off the track too when they re done You know this guy s going to get really tired There s no friction so he won t have to step off on the nice safe track But you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn t go back up as high so if you have Alright One at a time I like this Someone said something Christina said something and I think Karuna wanted to add to that He goes just as high like there s no change because there s no friction So Yeah then he doesn t go up to the top I could put the pie chart in sure And can you start him at the top Alright So I m going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to he s going to climb up the ladder right There s like a pretend ladder here And then how s that Yeah Okay Now I noticed when I did that something happened The pie chart Oh yeah Why Sounds like a height there that s increasing reference point is greater I like that Okay I m going to let him go I don t know if I can do that actually but I will try Yeah we can play around with it Make the sides taller then he ll have a greater distance to travel and it ll actually be more I don t know if I can yeah I don t think I can do that I don t think it ll it only allows me to click on the blue dots there You have to add track to do that You want me to pull those off to the side Okay Okay So you made a little bit different half pipe Oh no Alright So you don t want to look there s some thermal energy What s going on with that Okay That might ve happened But why do I now see red in the pie chart Yeah There s a force that will allow for the energy to transfer Good Let s get him back on that half pipe and you know guys I don t think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up So I don t really think that is going to make much of a difference But we do need to collect some data and start with this proposal so Where did we leave off I think there was something that we were looking to collect there Height Okay good Let s continue with that please Well measuring tape Oooh There is a measuring tape I don t even see these things Measuring tape oh It even says fet okay good So how s that look No no Well what do you want me to do with it Going to the ground That s not the ground From the reference point Oh alright I m right on the reference point Go up a little So what do you want me to measure Well where am I going to measure From what to what The reference point to the highest point Okay I think the highest point would probably be the center of him but they do have that nice little red dot Can we just agree that we re going to go with the red dot Yes Yeah Why don t we go there It can t be diagonal Okay Is that good Yeah Yes Shut the lights off for this measure Okay Now this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with I wonder if there s any easier way for me to get this Oh Oh that s pretty neat I suppose I could use a measuring tape or I actually have that so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier if it could speed things up So what do we want to say for the height Seven I don t know if I d say seven So we all agree it s somewhere between six and eight yes Yes I d say 7 2 And it does go over the seven a little bit so height equals seven point Two Four Six Zero You tell me or it s going to go forever Let s start over again Seven I don t think it goes to the half mark 7 1 Maybe we need a show of hands on this Who believes it s 7 Who believes it s 7 meters No one s raising their hands that s good How about 7 1 7 1 meters Alright I got one person there Now I m looking at this from an angle right And anytime you want to make a measure you do want to have your eyes right above what you re measuring and obviously I m just going to move over here just so I can get a little bit better And then what else can I do to try to really measure this well Pause it Yeah I think I m going to pause the animation Now if I was making an actual measurement I d make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever I was measuring What do we say about oh that s good What do we say about these measures that we make in science They should be you re only as good as your measures Yeah You re only as good as your measures What does that mean Kristen It means that if your measures are not precise and consistent then everything else won t be precise and consistent Can someone elaborate on that a little bit Or do you want to add to that No someone else can elaborate on it Okay Are you sure I can give you a little more No Okay Let s see Who haven t I called on at all today because I want to make sure I get everyone You haven t called on Jill Alright I m sure she doesn t mind repeating it for you I think you said you re only as good as your measures Because if your measures aren t precise then all your other work that you re using the measures for Yeah if you measure something for speed It would be wrong Why Well no if you It could be you re right If you make some poor measures and then you go to graph it No If you take distance and then multiply it by time then speed would be wrong Like if you had the wrong distance then speed would be wrong and then making it after that your graph would be wrong Well it would be wrong right from the perspective you said distance times time and speed is distance divided by time Did everyone hear that Yeah That s okay though You re saying we don t want to get off the main idea here If you re getting these distances wrong and then you re going to graph your slope is going to be incorrect yes So remember in science we collect data From that data we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns graph it look at trends and patterns So if everything starts from our measures those next steps aren t going to be correct 
 Yes I think if it s really really quiet and you want to talk about something then go ahead But if a lot of people obviously want to talk probably a good idea to raise our hands Okay what else Be involved Be involved yes I will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion Because everybody has an opinion but I need you to express that opinion What else Don t criticize other peoples ideas Don t criticize other peoples ideas Okay What might you do instead Suggest something give your outlook give your opinion Okay Give your argument But don t insult the other person s ideas This is a safe place to share ideas okay Now we re going to have three jobs I m going to need a task master a reader and a time keeper Time keeper You want to be the time keeper Alright you need to let us know when we ve got about two minutes left of the class I want to be the task master Okay so what does the task master do They make sure that everybody s on task Yeah what else What might that look like Subjects get off or out of control So people get off subject we could a little bit of crowd control What about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands You get to pick on one Yeah task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk Okay Yes Is there a praiser Actually that s a good idea Let s have a praiser I want to be him You want to be the praiser Alright Michael is the praiser What s the praiser do Oh can I do that Dang it always You can team up with me Can we This class yeah you guys want to be a team Okay So what is a praiser What are you guys going to do Give compliments Okay give compliments Compliment their ideas their expressions okay And then I need a reader Preferably somebody on that side of the room I don t know how to read I m unavailable You ll read No Who would like to read About five seconds before I call on someone I ll do it Okay so the questions are all up here there s five of them You re going to read them so the whole group can hear Okay Okay Alright so task master Oh I m here Okay you re on task now and we re going to start by having the reader read us the first question Okay should people own ideas I don t really think so I think it should be shared like for public opinion Like public knowledge like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet Great thought Thanks You re doing good Well I think that the information should be shared but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it I think that if you come up with an idea shouldn t you have some like you have conferences everybody gets together and talks about stuff So why don t you have scientists and stuff that like created this idea come together and have a conference and talk about it so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff And then the people that made that contributed to it have like a patent I guess you would say or just like copy or not copyright it Like discovered by or Yeah like that Good opinion So coming together would be easier then Sometimes I feel like if If no one gets credited or gets yeah They won t want to like They won t want to Put the information out there Yeah put the information out there Like they won t have something to you know Work for Work for There you go Yeah because I think that everybody like wants a part of getting like Because you want that credit because you put all that effort into it So why not get a little bit of credit That makes it worth it How do you like that one Okay second question Should people own genes No Yes Well you kind of already own your own genes I mean you kind of they re your own Like any unless you clone yourself I mean nobody else has the exact same stuff You could Let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene The breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video which is actually a lack thereof of a particular part of a gene that is patented by a particular company Which means they found it they spent money to find it so they own the patent on it If you are a person you don t have to be female just to look for this but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it That s what it means to own a gene I think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money that can be like Oh I m going to put a patent on that so boo ya can t take it Yeah I don t think that s right I mean if someone they should like put it open to the public because I mean if it s a gene like say breast cancer they should t just keep that private and make they pay for it Yeah So it s sort of like owning a part of a human If you own a gene by a corporation it s like owning a part of the person who has that gene or doesn t have that gene So It s sort of a moral issue Would you want to be owned by a company just that little tiny part of your DNA I wouldn t Excellent point You would Good job Jenna I wouldn t Oh okay You practically just went against everything we just said Anybody else have any input I agree with Jen Okay third question Would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer Yeah No I would not Well it depends on what age I m at Because like then you have that whole impending like doom your whole entire life like Oh I m eventually going to get cancer might as well just die That s why I die But if you do know then you have the chance to actually deal with it You re going to have to deal with it anyway Yeah but if you knew you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life You would know you would live life to the fullest I would I would live life to the fullest if I knew that I actually had this cancer I would know and I would do the best I could to live my life without settling Yeah so the shadow of you that eventually And that would just push me forward considering Drive yourself Whatever I do Yeah And maybe just maybe if I knew I would work to try to cure it myself So then I would be helping other people as well I would want to know Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions Please feel free to share I think my what s it called my opinion I d want to know so that if you didn t know and you have kids you could be passing it on to them and wouldn t that hurt you to see that to have your kids have cancer Like I would think that And then if like I did I would want to know I would like Jen said live life to my fullest and Because some things like if I was per se white I would go tanning wouldn t that hurt your cancer Because like radiat Well that s what causes it you know what I mean I d just do things differently if I had it Remember what they said in the video it s often a maybe It s not a you will have this it s a maybe There are things that they can check for that they can say definitely you will or will not get like Huntington s Disease which is a very devastating disease Remember how they talked about Tay Sachs which kills very early Huntington s is somewhat similar but it kills later in life And starts to show signs mid 30 s and usually death is somewhere in the 40 s or 50 s so that s significantly earlier since life expectancy is in the 70 s in this country So Would you want to know yes or no if you had something like Huntington s which is definitely a yes or no but what about in a situation that s a maybe I don t want to know if it s a maybe because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not I would still want to know Yeah because what if your body starts shutting down like one night and you just start twitching in your sleep Wouldn t you want to know that s from cancer rather than your brain s messed up and drugs or something I don t know Yeah I think I d want to know I mean like instead of just not knowing what s causing all this stuff happening in your body Some think it s because I m a very curious person I d want to know what s going on I would want to know Because like Jenna said like one night you re just having a seizure or something you could take like medicine like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have rather than just like trying to deal with it and like that you could die because you never even knew what was happening So I d like want to have that back up plan with me So just to clarify we re talking about an offense end rather than a defense team So rather than waiting until you have it and reacting taking preventative measures ahead of time Like an inhaler for asthma Some people have to take their inhaler every single day twice a day morning and the afternoon but there s other people who don t have it as severe or a higher risk not as high as a risk who only take it when they re having an asthma attack So what you re saying is having like the pill every day constantly I would still want to take that chance So you would you want to take the pill Yeah If you know you have cancer early enough can t you get rid of it Can t they get rid of it If it s like Yes the earlier you know the better chance you have Yeah that s why I would want to know I don t think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer that doesn t mean you re going to die from it Like you could get hit by a car today and nobody could tell you that nobody could predict that So I don t think I wouldn t want to know like if I was going to if I have cancer or anything I don t know I don t think it s You don t know that that cancer s going to Yeah and then I m just going to be in fear all my life like thinking like Oh I m going to die from that When that s not necessarily Like the you know exact thing that you re going to die from Like it s not a guarantee so Very good Yeah it s because of that Great job It s because of that maybe that maybe like you might be like how that guy on the video said you have a 99 of getting a heart disorder you might be that one percent that doesn t get it And you spend your whole life preparing spending all this money on preventative measures and getting all these pills setting up stuff and then you go through your whole entire life and you don t even get it That s true That he does have a point But then wouldn t you want to take those precautions because You d be happy that you did but then you spent all that extra stuff But what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it No I mean you don t like you don t get all the stuff just in case and you don t take it s like you don t even take the medicine It s only for like when you have like Travis said if you have a seizure you can take that it stops it Well that s kind of just like getting hit by a car Exactly Preventative measures is like looking to see if there s cars and if you don t look I mean you could get run over you could not But then you also like what if you lived in fear of getting that taking all these precautions is kind of wasting your life trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen That s why people should at the right age when you have the right maturity decide whether you want to know or not and not have it mapped out when you re born whether you re going to die or not Or by what In the movie how they just like took that thing Right That would be freaky as a woman Like you just went all throughout nine months of that and now you get to find out that your child s going to die in it s kind of freaky That actually brings us to our next question Okay What genes would you want to know your children had Why and how would that change you as a parent I wouldn t want to know at all I mean that s part of giving like human birth the surprise I guess It s a gamble You can t always like create the perfect human being Well if you could find out what genes they were going to have could you fix them Like how that person got rid of the forehead thing Right now no But that is a direction we re heading in You can right now completely sequence your child s genome if you have the money and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that That s messed up I don t care what my child would look like I don t really care But I just don t like you could prevent it from having these like life threatening diseases like cancer or Huntington s or like Parkinson s Disease Alzheimer s But then again that s a way of like too like I would want to know life threatening diseases but not because like you can cure like seizures You can like can t you Like my friend s been cured of that She had them and then now she doesn t anymore because she took medicine and stuff now she doesn t have it But there s people that have been taking those medicines and then still have it now which doesn t make sense Is that cured or treated Treated Yeah Cured means that you no longer have the disease Treated means that it s managed with medication or It s treated then Wait it s cured Yeah it is cured But anyways How would that change you as a parent knowing that You would know what to do if you have it Stay with your child at all times I don t want my kid dying Your kid s going to be in like a stroller until age 13 See it wouldn t change me as a parent It just wouldn t change me I think it d make someone stronger Because going through all of that hard times like with your child and it being sick and stuff wouldn t that make you stronger than having a normal healthy child And make you closer to them But you would still love your child the same way You would still try to have the best memories with your child either way If you knew that this that your child was going to die or not You would still do the same thing Except maybe change their diet or Take more precautions Yeah more precautions Pad their room They re going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something But you wouldn t change your experiences with your child I would Well I wouldn t Would you Bernard What Change your experience with your child Yeah Just don t go to Disneyland it s not worth it It s not worth it he won t even remember it Nope Oh the fifth question What does any of this have to do with you Like as in personally or as in That s a good question I m confused Say that again As in personally Yeah both ways as in persoanlly and as in a generation Give yourself super powers Hey stay on task Good job Stella Thanks I guess you re just kind of getting us ready for the future you know Like thinking like about your children like in the future like what if like what if you really wanted to know and then like what would you actually do about it if you ve never thought about this before Is this technology possible Yeah Not quite yet So who s going to have to make those decisions Us Our generation This generation and next generation The genes are us And if you want to know everything about yourself if you want to know then you have to go through the genes But if you don t want to know then you don t have to Yeah And so those people that think it s like That want to know should Wait what Never mind Should be able to Yeah should be able to And then the people that don t want to know shouldn t harp on them they should just keep their opinions to themselves And see it from their eyes too and just have an open eye to it not being so negative So what happens if say half of society would like to have their genomes sequenced or their children s genome sequenced and the other half does not want to or doesn t have the means to because it s probably going to cost money Right What might that how might that impact society as a whole Not just the individual As in this country individual s rights are paramount right Hmm So it ll be messed up like it is already How 
 Okay Look at your music We are doing four parts obviously With them take just a general idea for the whole thing Raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song Raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes Sopranos where do you have eighth notes Shelby tell me Measure nine Say it really loud so they all hear you Measure nine Measure nine very good Audrey where do you have eighth notes Measure thirteen Thirteen good Reese where do you have eighth notes Measure nine and measure Measure nine and thirteen Hey what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part then Same rhythm Almost the same rhythm all the way through Tenors where do you have eighth notes Braden Twenty one and twenty two Twenty one and twenty two So getting toward the very very end Altos tell us something about your part rhythmically Raise your hand Give me a summation of what you do Jamie We don t have any You don t have any at all You only have quarter notes half notes and some whole notes So how many beats does a half note take up everybody Two Two make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes Solf ge what key are we in Where is Do Brady F F major So the first pitch that the altos have is Do Do Sopranos what s your starting pitch Mi Basses what s your starting pitch Do Tenors Sol Very good Look at it for a second there are some jumps in the very beginning They don t mess around right away we ve got some eighths and some intervals Chant on solf ge your part One and two and three and four and Very good Go on Two three four On the second to last measure on the first page bassists and altos will move Stepwise motions so you ll they both go up one step Be aware of that Notice that we have some repetition Do you see some patterns that are coming back So if you miss it the first time you get a second shot Where if you get it right the first time remember what it sounds like so you can do it again Continuing second page One two three and chant Freeze Let s go back and join the basses with us at measure nine Do re mi Everyone measure nine and Okay Sopranos careful it might screw up your voice Why did you have an issue there Why did you miss it It s a skip Because it s a skip in the melody And why else A practical reason Here to here Because it s hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one Top of the next page measure seventeen A little faster and go Sorry seventeen Sopranos fa altos la tenors fa basses fa Ready Hey everybody has fa that might be a good place to find the measure La This will help You re right sorry except the altos Listen right there when you re actually singing for that and go You ll have to hold this for a very long time Go back to the beginning The rule is number six Jesse repeat the last step The last step Oh never quit singing Never quit singing Look up find your keys points Okay Second key Do mi so mi do so do Sing your starting note One two three four Good Now I have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this Take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads Do a quick run through because it s hard to know I cant remember what I missed I m still freaking out about the whole thing Take a minute replay it in your head Find areas where there were problems for you Overall you did extremely well You listened to each other You could hear that it sounded like music If you weren t sure about an interval you would sing it and then you would go Oh this is right yes and you were affirmed And I think you got more confident as you went along Problem areas Raise your hands if you had one Chelsea My problem I had was with measure seventeen Seventeen Sopranos do to fa that s a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there So then you heard it and you were able to go on and then I liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen Finding fa that s a strange function in the music Yes Patrick Measure nineteen fa to la Okay nineteen fa to la Just making sure that you know where you re moving Fa to la Where Oh nineteen Yes sorry My eyes were at seventeen Good Bass hands Excellent thank you Grant where Twenty Twenty Yes and what did you do I couldn t figure out the notes I mean I couldn t figure out the I think it surprises you because you move up by a step You were fine so la and the ti you weren t willing to actually sing ti because it s not very often that you sing it Stepwise motion so la ti do You did an excellent job basses throughout then returning to so and do when you had it You had some issues with fa and la Colin Six and seven Where we were going from la to fa and then back to do and then we had an eighth notes Because of that Okay So being aware of when you have eighth notes And chances are there isn t ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don t So when you hear it then you can move with them and it s always by step when you have eighth notes And it s always ascending So you don t have to worry about going down anywhere but yes fa and la continue to be icky I didn t time it We have to sing it again I m so sorry Okay so we fixed the things that we missed We re going a little faster so it sounds like music and not just this exercise Listen across the room to each other Do mi You stayed very well in tune Do mi so mi do so do Set your key Remember you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can If you look up basses I m trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often Sing your first note please One two three four Have a seat And now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second That means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time and if you haven t had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet it s time because this is opinion time and there s no wrong The room is going to tip over from the hands on this side There are four sections Jamie Well sometimes they re like a step away from each other but something like I know they re like one long and sometimes I Okay So there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time Okay Hannah I thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time I would agree The first time you did better than the second There are a couple of reasons for this Raise your hand if you feel like when you think back on how well you ve done both times you did better the first time Why Why Emily Because you were so focused and trying to get it right so the second time we ve already gone through it so we relaxed a little and little things slip up Okay Some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much What else possibly Colin I think some of us got a little too over confident Ohhh that s an excellent thing to check Just making sure some of you don t get a little over confident Although basses the fa s and la s were much better this time as an overall section Amanda If the first time usually there s a few problem areas for me then I try to focus on them way too much and then I see the spots where it might have been tricky for me like that jump from la to do So I freak myself out about that even though I got it right both times You get stuck in your head a little bit Yeah Okay So doubting yourself and then not being sure What else can happen Ariella Along with what Emily said about how we sometimes get over confident because we ve already seen it and we just fly by it because we re not really trying to pay attention to it too much Okay Ryan Measure nine It s the so so mi I went back to the so because that s what we did on the first page Oh okay because you re remembering now the patterns that you had You get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time That s a good thought too Michaella Between the and because we to sing notes over and over again over and over again I didn t like it It s kind of hard I didn t get the first two notes right and finally on like the third note I think I just figured out what we were doing Patrick I think that sometimes because we ve already sung the music and now I think that we kind of know what s going on 
 Okay I can see two in here Can you read the article first please Yes Loudly The president of the republic should be an Egyptian born to Egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years Mm hmm I agree with the president um Mm hmm He should be Egyptian born to Egyptian parents because it will have make him have well rounded perspectives and it may lead him to having interests to other countries and so It would make him have interest or will not make him prevent him It would not prevent him to um from getting to a different country s interest than his country Okay Good job I agree with Yessenia because if both if he s from parents that are Egyptians he can have some connection with Egyptians and he won t have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have And um have like wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different Mm hmm That s what I that s what my opinion yeah that s why I agree with her Good I disagree with the part of the where it says that they should be Egyptian parents Mm hmm But I agree with Jesus and his concerns about the Egyptian parents But my opinion is that they should have at least one parent Egyptian and the other another race Mm hmm Because if one parent s Egyptian like the child or the becoming president would have a something of concerns and would know some parts of Egypt and its government and if the other and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries states Okay Good job Which the legislative process Good job I agree with Yessenia and Jesus because if they re from Egypt and their parents are Egyptian then they can have some cultural background and they ll know more from people and they ll have connections with the people Good Good So now what is the result now Do you think you re going to change the part I see I ve heard some different opinions here Are you going with the change or do you want to keep it as it is I think we should keep it as it is because I mean that s a good thing to have Egyptian parents and a background like Hilda said a background of culture Mm hmm So I ll say yes leave it Just leave it the same Okay Just that part Okay Very good So you will just leave that part as it is without change Is there any other parts for this article Yeah there s a second part His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years Mm hmm Um I disagree because um when you re young you ll know more about technology and computers and everything Mm hmm And that s how um the youth and younger children in Egypt that s how they went and communicate I agree with Yessenia a lot because when a president is younger but not old he can connect with the youth and other younger people Because when Egypt was in the revolution the president was 81 years old Mm hmm Mm hmm Eighty four And behind the revolution was the young and they were like younger So he didn t really understand them really well and they didn t understand him well because he was a little older than them So for me I ll say 35 um yeah that s a good age for the president They can connect with teenagers and people of younger I just Very good I like the connection that you made Jesus between the age and the people who were behind the revolution Good job I disagree with Jessie and Jesus Good Yeah Because I think that part of the constitution is okay because 40 um 40 years is makes them have plenty of experience and to doing his their work And like it makes them like for like what Jesus said about technology they can learn about it and they can show them and all So basically they they ll pretty much know Who do you mean by they The becoming president That the old or the young The old The older one He cannot understand or work with technology that much Yeah Because Jesus said that they um they won t know about technology much Mm hmm But they if they re 40 they would have plenty of experience Mm hmm And they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens you know Okay Good good I agree with Emi but I agree with Jesus and Yessenia so Mm hm That s okay Um because Focus on what you want to do Like youth was like 70 or 80 of Egypt Oh good But if he s older he s going to have more responsibilities Mm hmm And he can be more responsible Mm hm So I disagree with Hilda Responsibility Because when they re younger they re more active and more responsible Like they can remember most things where they keep stuff And when they re active they can like travel through Egypt and see what s wrong with the country and what s wrong with the economy and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country So I ll say the younger but not too young Like 35 and up Thank you My opinion is that 40 is okay because the young the young people like at 35 because 35 s not that young but lower than that can make a little bit of difficulties because they make they might make like a mistake They might not know a thing and they just put another thing You mean they will not be mature enough Yeah mature Sure Good Like the 40s the 40 year old people like they they pretty much know everything They learn it they were educated The government laws and Mm hmm this and that Mm hmm But I think that part is 40 years is better Good So you would like to say okay just to open or or or break it down to so young like 30 or 20 or even teenager right Well I like that the two parts that you brought Hilda about 70 that the majority of the population of Egypt are already youth And your part that you said that this will make Jesus that that will make help them to have good connection with the young people there Good job So what did you decide on I see that you re going with certain direction We should change it The first part of the statement of Art 75 Mm hmm Which is the constitution We should keep that as it is And the second part of the 40 years we should change it Well we should leave it like that as well Very good I like how you are compromising with them Emi and you are going with the change So what part are you going to change Um It will be transforming to what Thirty five Mm hmm Thirty five years Not less than 35 Not less Good job Excellent Very good After you take your notes let s move to the next article Article 77 The term of the presidency shall be Gregorian six Gregorian years starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the Mm hmm The president of the republic may be re elected for other successful years Mm hmm I disagree with the six years Um Yes Mm hmm Yes Keep going Because I think it s a little longer and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president um having them over again And I think it should be lower for four years like in America And some of the disadvantages are that people could like him and he might be re elected for another six more years Um people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country And that s what I think of for the first one What do you all think about it You think the first one should be as it is or changed Changed to four years Changed to four years Yeah Okay What do you think I agree I agree with Jesus because an example of this is Hosni Mubarak He he um was following supposedly the terms of the constitution which which he made an excuse and took many chances in um having the presidency So I for like 30 years So I my opinion is to lower it down to four years and if they re re elected which they can use democracy like here in America Mm hmm If they re re elected they will have at least 12 years Basically Okay Do you disagree Um the statement I agree because it will give them more stability and more time to elect Mm hmm I agree with Jesus and Emi Why do you agree with them Because six years is a lot of years and if they don t like him they ll have to wait a lot a long time so that another president can come into power Okay So you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years Yes Okay The second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years The thing I dislike about this is that they don t really explain how um the terms For example the president of Egypt um used an excuse to be re elected because um he said that in the constitution it said it didn t say specifically how much how many terms um they lead So I ll I ll change that that um leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected Um Very good point Luis I didn t um Jesus I m sorry Very good point here You brought really a very important point And this is what will this was like the concern of many people over there The specification of of what Successful terms Of the how many terms very good Successive terms Very good Does anybody have an opinion or disagreement Uh I I agree with Okay I agree with um you because that s what Hosni Mubarak was really he was making excuse to like stay um him how like it is to keep him as a president and re elect him over and over to um and he was telling them that he was following the constitution because their theory said there was like no number of Yeah so he I agree also because like you said the example of Hosni Mubarak was the serious serious excuse They um the people were basically mad at them that um certain term because they didn t give a number of the terms so um that s why Hosni Mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over Very good When the point of staying too many years in power or in office that brings to me something that s going on in other two countries You remember any of the other countries in the Middle East and Africa that has something going on there Because of this specific part Libya and Yemen What s going on in Libya now They re protesting against um Gaddafi Very good yes Good job I like how you remembered his name Why Why they are protesting against him Because he d been in power for like about 43 years Good job Mm hmm Okay what else is going on in another country Or what country is having something going on Yemen Yemen Yemen Very good Okay Well this brings us to go back again a little further something about different types of governments Remember Egypt was a republic okay When their the president stayed there for so many years that will not be a republic country That will be what A dictatorship A dictatorship Very good That will be a dictatorship So the the the type of government is if government is not a the republic or maybe democracy as they say or claim but it will be it will be A dicta A dictatorship Very good And the people in power the people in the office government office will be what Dictators Okay It s because they do what they want to do and they don t listen to other people Okay and what is another name for dictatorship or very close to it 
 I think that Igneous and Metamorphic they re the least there are two books that don t use em cause they re Well my Igneous Yeah it Igneous and Metamorphic cool off and react And only a few particles came off but I was Yeah it s just awkward because mine was boosting most of yours Well yeah When I did my alien on my first try it was 42 grade Then now when I m measuring it again it was 22 grade It Mine never changed all it did was lost a little bit of it s rice crispies That was mine But I feel like Igneous rock like 20 Well yeah Cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock s outside And Mine was the same as Igneous and metamorphic And so if I d shake it like through weathering a bunch of rock would fall off I haven t done anything yet It was three I can t wait to Oh I have to say the one with the marshmallows cause it s Well for my Sedimentary it was harder Yeah mine too What Cause when I did mine only one piece of my Sedimentary broke apart and The Sedimentary My Igneous rock It has like almost It might be a little inaccurate since these are not real Sedimentary rocks You have to keep that in mind Well yeah So but what if they were real Sedimentary Would we be able to tell what they are Yeah Obviously Do you know any Sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar Yes I saw them in my yard They re called a granola ball No That was probably granite which is an Igneous rock For Jeanie do we write just how many lasts Cause mine must ve had Okay so when I when I did the blendering of my Sedimentary I lost only three grams off of my Sedimentary rock So I m not sure what would happen if I add these two Because of the heat out of the cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue Metamorphic rocks what would happen was the heat would melt it and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil Yeah that s how that happens because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while Yeah Like last we and like have you ever heard of a rock that s called Metamorphic rock Yeah It can be greasy Let s talk about why we use the models Obviously you re never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that s like the taffy Why did we use the Laffy Taffy for our model Because the heat and the pressure the heat and the pressure would like stick together but like a Sedimentary rock We use our fingers to add that heat pressure We had to simulate it somehow we couldn t do the actual Earth process in the classroom Do you agree with that Mm hmm Okay so you understand why you understand why we use that material for our model Okay Right it probably melts And why did we use the microwave for the Igneous rock Because What were we trying to simulate there From Magma is a really hot substance and this is what Igneous rocks can form from Could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom No No Could we work a marshmallow Yep So we understand the connection there We re trying to use materials that we can bring into the classroom but that will still simulate lava magma the processes Okay So pressure I think it has less effect of all the It had a lesser effect going through the processes of Of both Weathering And erosion And erosion okay Now you guys can think about this if you didn t like the samples and examples up here that I used you could always do it different Food material To make up your own experiment later Okay Let s talk for a moment Why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion Why are we measuring again Look at your rock samples do they look the same as what we measured in here No No What happened You have to measure the difference The difference and why would there be a difference What could we do to our rock samples Changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them Let s use the same what did you use when you pre measured I would keep it the same Why would I keep it the same Because it s Can we compare centimeters to inches Yes You can Think about that because later when you have to come back and do the difference how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches How can you compare those two measurements You re telling me you wanna go centimeters here but inches down here I would keep it the same They would make it mathematically You working on your difference Your difference in mass This your pre mass Explain to me how you got to that Where are the books They might add on to another sedimentary rock cause it s like never ending For some reason my Sedimentary and my Igneous rock They both lost a half inch in length Yeah mine too In my igneous rock grams it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams Mine lost no grams Mine gained grams Your gained grams Yeah I had 17 grams I had 17 grams and then it came back to 21 And this one went up one Because when this one went up three Maybe you should check that over Cause it weathers and erodes away Well I m guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people s stuff went into mine and made it bigger Cause it can do that it can See Right there All around the Oh I see it See Other bits and pieces of other people s went into mine and made mine bigger With mine a bunch of bits and pieces And mine started to melt Because your observations say it crumbles apart it s breaking apart and moving Okay what about these gaps here These gaps Yeah how you gonna do that For some reason my Igneous rock Into the sample It made it bigger Made it heavier Did it have more mass after the Your protective sleeve s coming off That s a good possibility that might throw your measurements off Did it happen to anything else Any other sample Now you re working on a difference in You gotta find the difference in length and width and you re gonna find the difference in mass That s interesting you could explain that away right there Mm hmm isn t that the one Igneous the one you were saying got the strange results You can talk to me then Well that s probably how they make the canyons bigger Maybe because some of the rocks after rain and the sandstorms they could just pound together and make a big old rock So Okay so if it erodes off another rock I m listening are you talking about real life rocks when they really erode away Mmhmm And it starts to rain cause a lot of times it s like wind and rain A lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain with the rain and here s another rock which makes a bigger You re thinking sometimes with real life rocks you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks Right do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary Those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock okay So that would also cause reason for your measurements I like where you re going with that Try to make that connection You know Unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how metamorphic rock s not made of Laffy Taffy So how s this go back to rocks in real life Think about that Some of our videos that we were watching About what salts quartz in these two processes You have to let the water go down Cause the heat inside of it could ve frozen Cause they heat over there we had it kinda Whoa what s the answer 19 grams 19 Igneous Igneous How could you make that Explain it to your little sister She s not gonna be able to understand that she wasn t here What could you put on your rock cycle diagram Okay So you re gonna have This is 17 17 for what Igneous What about sedimentary Tell me how Sean needs help Um he needs help with Okay where he s trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock What do ya mean No I was saying that it may have gotten darker Darker because of the heat Yeah A lot of rocks do that Yeah But it could be jus the pink Yeah it could be I could write down that it could be pink Yeah what happened to my metamorphic rock is I can Yeah that s because of this thing in between our finger and Mine it didn t get darker than mine though So you could add that to what you put in So how would that affect our measurements How did it affect your width Igneous and sedimentary rock could Now talk to me though if it s in You wanna know why those are there Because a lot of rocks don t have protection that doesn t help them And a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag which mixed with the Sedimentary It could And sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around guess what it would do It would also become a sedimentary It s just like the rocks it s just like the rocks in life It s more similar to real life Yeah The eroded bits would stick to other rocks So I just added like bits We have bits and pieces See if I was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this this would also become this because this isn t on the mat This would begin to stick And when you ball it together it makes it appear coloring to it that show that it s inside there I think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock After each sample ones that were weathering and erosion So you re gonna compare your two measurements pre measurement post measurement to see if there s a difference for each rock Hmm Hmm Do we have to subtract Do we What s your key word that could tell you what to do Difference Go show me I know you re thinking You just told me what key word tells you what to do Where were we Finding the mass After we ve done the weathering and erosion Okay are you gonna get started Yes Yes Jack are you finished with that scale Can we use manners please Can we use manners Can you say please pass the balance Talk to me guys just for a moment about the differences in those in your We ve got Ashley s igneous we talked about that I figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen because they put the sedimentary came on to the metamorphic So we can see again how just and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag that s how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock And I think it became darker because the heat because of the pink And because of the pink Yeah Okay think about in real life sedimentary rock when those levels when those layers are smashed together Okay don t some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure Okay that was your metamorphic Yes Brooke And also you get the igneous in there it sticks to it and you can just put it inside there cover the layers off and it actually gets inside the metamorphic So you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks and how they could combine with one another and result in a completely different rock Okay So on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome Not the candy rock cycle the real one It says that you could use a diagram okay Using your textbook Level Readers Science Journal or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed Anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle Okay My igneous has gone down just a bit 
 We have been talking about being a good speaker and a good listener And in class your teacher had you do an activity in your classroom where you sat across the way from a student and you read them a paper that you had written about dingoes And then you had to stand up in front of the class and you had to present that Do you remember that Okay So we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener and your teacher and I worked on a rubric and you got a grade for some different things about speaking Do you remember what any of those things were that you got a grade on Do you remember what she was looking for Posture Posture What do you mean by posture Not moving around Okay So when you re standing up in front of the class what would you look like Standing straight Okay Not leaning against the wall Okay good Do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like Voice Okay What about your voice What should your voice do Use your presentation voice Yeah like a presentation voice Does it sound like this What does a presentation voice sound like Kind of loud but not like an outside voice Yeah kind of loud but not screaming right I like how you said not an outside voice All right What else for speaking Do you remember what else One of them I know didn t really have to do with speaking but it had more to do about your report And it was did your report make sense Right Did what you write make sense What about if I read my report really slow Is that good I can t remember It starts with an F Fl Fluency Fluency Good And what does that mean You re not reading slow or too fast Good not too slow not too fast just right Okay So we have posture voice makes sense fluency do you remember what the last one was You re not doing it right now Eye contact Good All right You want to make eye contact right Right So when you re reading you want to be able to do what See the people Yeah look at the audience right Kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people Okay now if I m a good listener if I m the person sitting in the audience how can I show my classmates that I m being a good listener No distractions Okay So don t distract them What else Don t be distracted by someone else Okay So you want to focus on the speaker All right How can you show them that you re focused on them How would they know Look at them Yeah look at them Right Okay look at the speaker And what else What about at the end when they re done Ask questions Good Ask questions Anything else Sit up straight Okay Good Could you tell them maybe how they did What do we call that Like feedback What they did well on or maybe what they could do better Right Okay Put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at What do you think you do a good job at Okay You re focused on the speaker All right you sit up straight Okay You don t distract others That s good Okay Now out of these two which one do you think you need to work on Which one could you do a better job That one Okay So maybe you could ask more questions at the end Okay All right What about speaking Which ones do you think you do a good job at already Posture Okay You do a good job on that one Make sense Mm hmm Eye contact Mm hmm Okay so out of your voice and fluency which one do you think you could do better Which one could you work on The voice Voice All right So what do you think you need to do better with your voice Speak up louder Speak up louder Maybe a little bit closer to like that presentation voice Okay On your rubric it was what five four three two one Do you remember what you got on your volume Three A three okay So Miss Welch thought you could do a little better too so maybe next time you could get a four or a five Okay So we have been talking about famous African Americans and you had said that Walter Payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting Right All right So we are going to look at some information about Walter Payton and then see if we can maybe do better on asking questions and maybe working on your volume Okay Cool Okay So Austin the other day you and I met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about Walter Payton and the first one was I was speaking and you were videotaping me And then we flipped it and I videotaped you So what I want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out And then we re going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future Okay So we looked up some facts about Walter Payton and let s watch my speech first And I want you to be thinking about while you watch me how did I do on eye contact How did I do on my volume How was my fluency Did it make sense And how was my posture Okay on a scale of one to five five being Woo hoo Miss Suzer you did a great job and one meaning Miss Suzer I didn t even see that at all Okay All right you ready All right Let s see how I did Walter Payton was one of the best running backs in the NFL He played for the Bears after going to college in Mississippi Sweetness has over 110 questions But he died in 1999 of liver cancer He s one of the best football players of all time I wish I could have seen him play He was my favorite football player All right So let s see What do you think Do you want to use purple or blue You want to be purple Okay So how do you think I did on eye contact What do you think You think a four Okay why do you think a four Did I give much eye contact No No Oh you re saying yes I only saw myself look up once so I m going to give myself a two I don t think I did a very good job You re too nice Alright How was my volume Pretty good Okay I think I ll agree with you there How was my fluency or my rate Good Okay I think I m going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where I thought maybe I could have talked a little faster I don t know All right Did it make sense what I said Yeah Okay And how was my posture Was I standing up straight looking ahead Okay I wasn t like swaying or rocking or anything All right so it looks like overall I think I need to do better on eye contact And you thought I could probably do a little better on eye contact And I think I could do a little better on my fluency I think I could have maybe spoke a little bit faster It sounded like I was kind of in slow motion Okay So now let s watch how you did And then we ll grade you Okay All right so here you are Okay Let s see All right How do you think your eye contact was A one Why did you give yourself a one Because I didn t really look up You didn t look up at all did you Were you looking at your paper What were you concentrating on Paper The paper Okay Yeah I would say it would be good maybe if you held your paper down at your belly button right and then you could look up All right How was your volume Not evident Okay I m going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you I think the reason we couldn t hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face I think your voice might have gone out a little bit more All right How was your fluency or your rate What do you think I didn t hear myself at all Okay All right I thought it wasn t bad at all I thought it was pretty good because when I could hear you I thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four You weren t reading really fast You were reading so that I could understand you It was just kind of hard to hear All right Do you think your facts made sense Why did you give yourself a two I don t know I had some in there and I don t know All right Because you could only hear parts of it You think if your volume had been better you could have heard more Okay All right I m going to give you a four because I think it made sense All right What about your posture How was your posture Man you re being hard on yourself Why did you give yourself a one Because I wasn t I was like Wiggling around a little bit Yeah Okay Well I m not going to be that hard I m going to give you a three Okay so if we were going to do this again maybe in front of your class or in front of your teacher or something what would you do differently next time Now that you ve seen yourself what would you do differently Maybe the things you got ones on right Okay So maybe looking up over your paper Maybe your volume Yep Maybe working on your fluency or your rate maybe a little faster right What about your posture what would you do differently Stand straight Okay Try to stand still All right So it looks like we have a couple things we could work on right for next time Okay Sounds good 
 And then with Carl s example was down to MSB marginal social benefit So how can we put that into words Marginal social benefit Andrew Isn t it something that can t really be measured Okay Yes and it s harder to measure but how would you explain it What is it Think about what we did in the example and say like everybody is benefiting from washing cars Right So what is It is a social benefit and it s what he gets from the society It s what society gets from you Yeah you re on the track but it s what we get from his interaction Right Okay So it s the benefit to society for whatever market that is Okay So social benefit this is going to be the additional benefit okay The additional benefit that society those that are not involved in the transaction but from society get from one more unit Okay Now I m going to put next to this slash costs Oh just kidding That s that s the other document So down here is just something is a negative thing So what this leads to Do you think these two definitions lead to positive externality or negative externality Positive Positive they re things that market itself does not take care of Okay Market obviously in this example does not take Carl and offer YTB for all of our benefits considering it doesn t pay him at all Right There are things in society that when you look at the actual amount someone is paid they re maybe not paid to the extent of the benefit they get Okay So right now if you flip over to the back we ll come back to definitions later flip over to the back Oh I m sorry on the other sheet because I didn t put it on the back on the other sheet you have two columns I want you first by yourselves without talking to someone else think of try to think of at least two examples where there are things in society where there are markets for these and it makes everyone better off because they re there and we all benefit from them Okay Go ahead write them down Think about it You really think you re going to have to defend it So think about on your own what markets are out there things that happen that benefit everybody not just the people participating in the market So benefits more people than are just paying for the service not just the buyers or the sellers of that service but outside of it people are benefiting from it Write and think and then we ll talk about them Write and think write and think Wait do we need negative ones too Just positive right now we re going to go back to the negative ones So just think of the positive ones right now Okay benefit people again let s cover the definition again Benefit people outside of the buyers and sellers in that transaction Okay So we re not talking about just the buyer of someone who goes to a store and buys something and the benefit they get from it that s marginal benefit but that person buying this gives other people benefit outside of that person But like if they built a hospital in the neighborhood and it has a reputation of being not like they don t have a lot of equipment it s not very good Then could you like the property values of the of the town go down So you could talk about Okay So you re on absolutely the right track so then that would be a negative Like so what could always be a positive benefit Okay Well let s talk about some of the negatives Some of you wrote some stuff down I saw Matt right away think of something what d you write down I said flu shots Okay Why Because the more healthy people there are around the less you ll I don t know The less sick people there are the more healthy people there are Overall right Because if one of you Think about this If one of us If half of the class gets flu shots and the other half doesn t that mentality shows us that now that other half is more likely to get the flu right So that is an absolutely Flu shots What could you make that into a broader explanation Vaccinations Vaccinations Okay Vaccinations So go ahead and write those two down because those two are textbook examples Is medicine good Medicine It depends if it s contagious but go ahead and be more specific so you want to put flu vaccine or any kind of vaccine It s a perfect example because that is a big issue right now A lot of parents are talking about not vaccinating their children because they re worried about issues of autism that have been indirectly slightly connected to it but for the most part that has not been proven yet so now we re seeing other ramifications of that decision Over here go ahead Pro sports Pro sports tell me why People who play get paid for doing it and the fans enjoy watching them Okay good So pro sports and we re not even talking about people that necessarily pay for the ticket to go You might just get to watch on TV A lot of times on the main stations you don t even have to pay cable lines So you would go ahead and benefit from those If you pay aren t you technically then part of that If you paid for it then you re part of that market So like vaccinations You pay for vaccine Okay But that person that pays for the vaccination doesn t get it but all of us benefit because that one student got the vaccine Okay So that s the key It benefits people outside of the one paying for it So that s why it s social Okay Sam YouTube Okay Tell me why Because people can freely put up any type of videos they want That uses creativity and people that want to hear music from anywhere can do it wherever they want Absolutely So YouTube is a great modern example because we all benefit from that kind of laughter that enjoyment It doesn t cost us anything People do it for their own interest and we all benefit Cody Education Education Tell me why Students learn and they get to do well in the world and then the world gets some technology Okay Good Like you brought up tax payers So your parents pay for your education in school Right But by the fact that you re becoming educated even if they pay for your college tuition Now you don t give back just to your parents with that education you give back to society overall Right To everyone hopefully in the world one way or another you end up giving back to society For more people than are paying for your education Okay Yeah Clean energy like electric cars or something because even if you yourself don t drive one that makes like it improves Okay Anything green Absolutely Anything green like that You can put green technologies benefit the world which kind of brings us to one that we re going to talk about with a negative Okay Yeah I just had a question Could you put stock like since if someone buys a stock it raises the price for everyone else Yeah I ve never heard that example but you could argue that It s still benefiting a select group though I guess in some stocks though that s millions and millions of people so I mean you might be able to argue I didn t know because they re still involved in the transaction They re only involved if it s their initial one So that s why I think it s worth some argument there You might be able to prove that I think some of the other ones across the board are a little bit more general but that s definitely something to think about Andrew Well see I agree with him because when the stock prices go up people see that as Oh the public is spending more so that would bring the economy up which would bring That s a really good point because that s an indicator of the health of the economy Right So by the stock market being high it makes everyone employ people Yeah that s a good extra point to add in Yeah What about something like sorry You were thinking of the same thing at the same time Alright go ahead So like taxpayers and the government pays them and even if you don t pay taxes you still benefit from it You could actually put public works down in your column because now that we ve kind of opened that can we can think about parks right And I get the example all the time There s a really nice park I live right by Glenn Ellen and I am not technically in Glenn Ellen but right by there then I go down there I run by the park I take advantage of that public area and I add to my benefit So just by having that park it kind of benefits more people than just the people that pay for it So any public works Police you could talk about firemen they benefit many more people than the people that pay for them The people that clear the snow off the roads Delightful Can I get some negative externalities then Flip it back over Let s go right on Flip it to the other sheet and let s go to the other thing here and then we ll start graphing it Marginal costs Let s put that in our own words here What is the marginal cost of these Everyone think about it for a second Think about it write down your own definition This is something you should know like the back of your hand at this point In your own words write down the definition of marginal costs Write it down you already did Marginal cost You got it Andrew What is marginal cost What is marginal cost The extra cost of hiring one additional worker Okay One more whatever it is It doesn t have to be a worker We re all thinking about workers because we just got out of inputs we just got out of inputs and factor markets and resource markets but remember those units one two and three they had marginal cost too If you picture a monopoly graph what does marginal cost look like on a monopoly graph Upward sloping Upward sloping right So we can think of the system in every unit So what does it need One the additional cost of what One more unit One more unit Let s just keep it like that because input is just factors One more unit because in a monopoly it s marginal cost of making one more unit In a labor market it s the additional cost of one more worker Keep in mind again these are both people that are participating in that market So I m going to put This is the same thing except for it s the cost So you wrote it ready in your own words but make sure you ve got that basic idea Additional cost of one more unit So now we re applying it to this new idea What s the marginal social cost of something The marginal social cost Andrew How much society loses for one more unit Okay How much society loses for one more unit or how much it takes away or cost us when we make one more unit So we re going to think and I m going to add thoughts here It s for all of society So flip it over what are some examples or go to the other sheet What are some examples of negative externalities now that we ve got this down in your mind What are some negatives Zach Breathing in pollution Pollution That again he is on it this is the textbook definition Pollution is the most common example So what has government implemented to try to curtail pollution What kind of things have they done Smoking ban laws Okay good smoking bans So you could say pollution you could also say cigarette smoke is a negative externality So government stepped in which is the type of pollution The government stepped in and said No you cannot smoke in places of employment you cannot smoke in any public area in Illinois it s obviously done by state but the state has stepped in to curtail this type of externality Betty Don t they have pollution rights that they can buy in the market Okay Very good Who do they buy them from The government Good So federal government actually sells pollution rights So that s another way that they deal with it What agency was created to deal with pollution The EPA EPA So the EPA is out there trying to make sure that only so much pollution happens Yeah This is kind of more local but like banks in Elmhurst like they make a lot of banks a ton of banks but every single time they make a new one it seems like less use of all the banks like there s no point to them and it s like a lot of So you re saying that s a negative externality because there s too much Not just that there s just like Say you replace a store that maybe some people use and make a bank and then there s less to do in Elmhurst Okay Try to think of the best way I mean I see what you re saying because that transaction takes away from your enjoyment of living in a town You could put something else there like a new house or a restaurant or something just don t put a bank Okay So how would the government fix that They could be like We re not going to let you buy it The bank buy that lot they could have said no So they might limit they might say how many of these business could be That s a new one I ve never heard of that but obviously there s something there to that because you re saying it s taking away from the enjoyment of people in the community It is maybe adding to the wealth of the community with the employment and the income that s being raised but overall True no I think you ve got something there but it s a different lens Andrew I think that a better example for that would be parking lots because then it s just there and not doing anything whereas for a bank it increases the competition and it increases the rate of The parking garage closer to the Y encourages people to go down to the retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of does encourage people to All right I like what you guys are going with this either one of you could make an argument with it That kind of brings up another point though This is somewhat of Alex are you with me This is somewhat of a this is somewhat of an opinion right Because now you re saying that there s certain things that there s definite and those are going to be our perfect examples like pollution No one in their right mind can argue that pollution gives a benefit to society They can argue that what they produce that produces pollution is helping industrialize I mean talk to China One example Their massive pollution few regulations at all because they re trying to compete with other countries and step up but they re not they definitely would say it s worth it But pollution itself no one can say that it s good Andrew mentioned something about the beauty of something What are some things that people buy or do 
 Okay Dylan what song will you be playing Playing B A and G Okay and line number Four Four okay Let s get your left hand on top Okay and whenever you re ready as soon as you start on the note B Give him a hand nice job You can have a seat Dylan thank you Okay Christopher I m doing number four playing the note A Playing the note A number four okay Left hand on top Christopher That s all Okay let s give him a hand Number four playing the note A Great Let s give him a hand Elise Number B playing number one Playing B number one okay great Make sure your left hand is on the top Okay that s your left hand and your right hand goes along alright whenever you re ready Let s give Elise a hand Playing the note B1 Okay Let s give Jessica a hand Dylan what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay go ahead whenever you re ready Let s give Dylan a hand Christopher what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay Okay Christopher try it one more time pressing your holes a little tighter From the beginning Thank you Christopher nice job give Christopher a hand Okay Drexel so what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay Let s give Drexel a hand nice job Okay now Elise what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay whenever you re ready Let s give Elise a hand nice job Hot cross buns Okay Jessica Okay Jessica try it one more time pressing your holes tighter and blowing really soft Yeah that middle part is where it gets tricky Jessica Let s try it one more time going from just the middle of the song and the four G s press tight and blow really gently There it is give her a hand Thank you everybody 
 Okay What s the next one Zach Jen you can put on a 50 line poem on that one here if you wanted to I got that You have Okay what was the main What was the summary What would be a good summary sentence Well they competed in a game known as the Memoriad Uh huh You guys had that one don t you You have the names and faces there That was great The game Are you doing the vocab though No Okay So wait hang on Should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words You can just do anything from that article The pictures were just to get you thinking about it That s why we did the words And the vocab was just to help us understand So it doesn t have to go off the vocab But the vocab kind of connects with an idea So it may kind of work out that way You ll have to let Zach see because you took what he had which is great and you added to it Do we put the name of the movie I m doing It s a song The croak part is a song Mm hmm that was part of the Okay I was getting There there s the song I was stuck on the reading one too Got one left Zach what s the text structure Sharpening his pencil Just go like that So was the Puppet in 1970 Or was it Yep 1970 That must have been old 1968 is when the Yellow Submarine came out Yep All right Do you guys want to put your pyramid up there Zach do you want to help do that Do you agree that he was right on the text structure Yeah See if you can build it I tried to size it just about right as close as I could get So it should fit in there pretty good I don t think it s sized up very well What I just got it as close as I could Zach It may not be 100 perfect And then the person that didn t read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers That means we got to do another one You each got a chance to read Yeah that s the tone one We need one more detail Did I make it a little too big or is it pretty close It s a little long Could be a little long huh Had a little extra at the bottom Next time I ll shrink it up just a little bit We still have one more That s fine And who read it Was it Zach We ll let Zach read those when the girls get done Okay Do I read the summary Do you just want me to read I don t know if he knows Start with the details Memoriad is an unforgettable competition Memoriad games is memorize 50 line poems People compete in the games called Memoriad The game is to memorize it Memorize names and faces and memorize a 50 line poem Very good And what was your text structure Description Description because they were describing all about He just talked He did the talking you did the writing Somebody gave you ideas Kinda maybe It was a good partnership The girls are just about done We ll let them read theirs And then we ll do our Jeopardy Can we tape the Jeopardy game Mm hmm yep We have the same people in Jeopardy that were in here Yes it is the same group Okay let s not have a sword fight right now She has one more task there She s got it all grammatically correct Okay Let s just Judy over here Do you mind if it s off to the side There s another one There s two of them Oh did it fall off Well we can put a little piece of tape over it Oh here it is There you go that should hold it up good All right see if you agree with what the girls have here Are you listening Zach Got a pyramid all set up Our text structure is wait do I start at the bottom Start at the bottom and the details kind of add to the summary The movie they were talking about was the Yellow Submarine starring Is it starring or staring Starring I bet Starring the Beatles The Beatles okay Their song called Being Green was made in 1970 Summary the television was made in 1953 Kermit was in 1970 Stoplight was made in 1920 They all had one thing in common They were in a color Very good I love that last sentence They all have that in common they re in color Text structure is sequence Sequence because It tells the order of them All the years very good Okay one of you guys go grab a marker board one from each team And I ll go get Jeopardy And you ll need a marker to write on the marker board I will pull the screen down All right Zach Zach Where are the markers You can grab one back there There s one up here As long as you got one or two for your group you can take turns Now these questions I think will flow pretty well today Whoa I can t even see it I think the yellow is better I know with the lights on it s a little harder but it helps to have the lights on Did we run review What Did we run review Text structure My music didn t come on Confucius says Vocab Text features Features Thank you Zach Yes they re different Confucius says Yeah Okay who started first last time Was it the guys Yeah Okay we ll let the gals start today So do I do text structure Oh you re gonna win Text structure 500 Text structure 500 Yeah what s the Confucius Says We had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit they were little sayings and you decide just which text structure they go with So that might go with text structure Yes it ll be a text structure question yeah Is that what you guys wanted was text structure right Yeah Okay In our state dams have been built Zach on many rivers These dams are used to product electricity we need But they also create problems Scoot your chair closer to your partner Scoot your chair back Prevents the other wildlife near the rivers Therefore we should not build any more dams Instead we should use solar energy or energy from the sun to produce electricity This will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us Hmm which of the five text structures We think it s problem solution Problem solution correct Give yourself 500 points Because it said problem in there All right what would the guys like Hey Sorry Zach what do you want They did text structure 500 It ll pop up yellow after I click on the next one Vocab for 500 Vocab for 500 Want to read that one Zach You should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response Hmm what does ponder mean You think Ahh perfect To think about Give yourself 500 points All right what would the gals like Should we try the Confucius question Yeah For 500 Okay Confucius says for 500 And Marissa can read this one Confucius says A beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes This is one of the five text structures Description Yeah description Description very good And I ll just set these out I got something that might help you guys since a lot of these have them you just kind of have your choices right there What would the guys like Very good Text features Text features 500 Text features 500 Which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects people and places you find in a book Index table of contents title What do you guys think Alphabetical listing What do you think Zach Index Index Index would be correct Good job guys What would the gals like Oh 500 Yeah I just did that 500 Should we text features for 400 400 okay All right Judy can read this one What text feature gives definition for vocabulary words Wait what is it Wait Yeah what do you mean for that Oh I didn t that one doesn t have the choices like the other one did It would be an index a glossary or a title Glossary Glossary is correct I put the choices on the other ones I just must have missed that one Very good All right Confucius says for 400 Confucius says for 400 Could you go for Mrs Lloyd s for just a couple minutes Okay I wanna go tell Mr Debush That s all right I ll just get you guys a pass here in just a second We ll do a couple more questions here All right whose turn to read It s Zach s Zach s turn Okay Confucius say First feed the lion then enter cage Hmm Sequence Sequence Do you agree with him Yeah Yes very good Sequence All right what would the gals like What one did they do They just did the Confucius says for 400 I want to do that one for 400 or for 300 right I think yeah Confucius says 300 Okay Yeah Okay all right Oh man basketball Whose turn to read Confucius says Net in soccer is much larger than net in basketball Compare and Yeah compare and contrast Very good All right so they did this one Zach What would you guys like You want to do vocab for 400 Vocab for 400 Yeah vocab Vocab for 400 Okay Many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs Very good Just a second What do you think First players Okay the first players You re exactly right Oh my gosh People who have done something for the first time and they don t get paid They re amateurs All right what would the gals like They did vocab Structure Yeah Structure 400 Yeah They want the big point ones Is it my turn Yeah I think so Living in the country is very different than living in the city A city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people In the country there are fewer cars and people In the city many people can walk to the movies stores and other activities In the country people must drive to get to places Compare and contrast Yeah Compare and contrast And she agrees Very good All right what would the guys like What do you want Zach Vocab for 300 Vocab for 300 Oh it s your turn Zach I depleted my savings when I bought my new basketball shoes What do you think Hmm what do you think One for depleted Oh I know this one Drained Drained yep Empty gone you used all your savings And basketball shoes can cost a lot of money so I can see that happening What would the gals like Confucius oh wait no no no Did they do text structure 300 Nope he just did the vocab Okay I want to do text structure for 300 Features for 300 No text structure Oh text structure I can go back Structure for 300 The eye is made up of many parts The white part of the eye is called the Sclera sclera and the colored part is called the iris The iris comes in many colors including brown blue green and hazel The iris is covered with the cornea which is clear and round Description Do you agree Yeah I should know about the eye because my stepmom s a she works at the eye company Wait did we just pass text features Oh she does They just 
 Hello guys After all the hard work you ve put in on doing your presentations and your tri board and all the really cool stuff you ve done now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you ve done all this research for Okay So first off doing a little poll Which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use Solar energy Why It looks pretty cool and I don t know it seems like the most efficient way because the sun s always there and the sun won t run out That s the word whenever you re done using it You can sell it You can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night You can sell it Okay so he thinks solar Who else Okay Go ahead I like the wind Oh so you can talk to him Because you want to be able to talk to each other right I liked the wind one because it stored up the battery And the battery whenever it wasn t windy and so it kind of was always there It didn t matter about the wind Yeah you can answer the question I also think that wind s the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind you can also make money off of that So maybe if you get it in enough homes you won t even have to have a job You can make money off that That s a very good point That s a very good point making money off of that energy source Which other ones did we say could make money Um the solar Solar can make money Well I like the wind Because it s like the sun is going to burn up one day but the wind is always going to be there And the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die but that s okay Okay well what are some pros and cons then So you just said birds would die if we use wind power okay Does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power I think birds dying isn t that bad because you know we eat birds so I don t think it would be that bad if birds do die I mean I don t think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy Not as much as oil or any of that other stuff Yeah or like we eat birds The other one I like is the hydro one that James did because His was ridiculous That was nice So what part of it were you most impressed with Like not like the demonstration but it was a great demonstration but hydroelectric power in general what part of that Like how if you have a pond or something you can put it in there and then it will power up your whole house Do we need moving water Oh yeah you need moving water to have that You d have to have a stream but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water And if you really wanted to spend some money there s also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir So that one actually sounds pretty good So somebody want to defend theirs Rakif I don t really like mine because Which one did you do I did oil Natural Gas Oil and natural gas okay Why not Because mine isn t as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy so it s probably going to run out pretty soon Like oil natural gas and coal do run out They re not going to be as here as much as the wind or hydro or something like that Well there s a lot of dangers involved with using oil right Oil rigs pipelines lots of dangers involved right Oil prices can cause high gas prices That s true too Remember in your presentation you talk about some of the dangers What were those dangers and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources For oil Yeah The pipelines can burst and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out They could cause another oil spill Explosions But coal I know you re supposed to like stick up for your natural resource but I kind of think coal can be good but it s mostly bad because a lot of people s lives are getting killed because of all the gasses smells and being down there for so long And I think that s also very bad And the land it hurts the land and the environment Coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it All the coal dust it can cause a lot of lung problems So the miners that go down there they re risking their lives right Yeah Any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal No Nuclear energy What Nuclear energy is the worst Okay what about nuclear energy How dangerous was that when you looked it up It s a six out of ten chance Of what happening It depends It costs way too much first of all to build it It is very expensive That s true It s got a lot of risks like if it gets into your water or if you breathe in the radiation I imagine it could It smells bad Okay does collecting oil use more energy than it provides Good question What do you mean by collecting oil Like if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil does it use more energy than it provides No I don t think so Because in my presentation it said it produces like a widespread like a very large amount of energy And also that your wave and tidal power powers our system as you said in your presentation Oh good point Those two actually work together When you talk about the wave and tidal power that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling So that s a very good thing as well It s a benefit of drilling Absolutely Are there different energies that do benefit each other Yes the solar energy and wind Because the wind energy is based off the sun because of how the sun waves come onto the Earth and then it turns this sun mill so it produces the turning of the mill so the sun and solar energy and wind energy The solar energy and the wind they actually work together because I ve seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top One then the other can go That s okay I think solar energy is a really good thing because for a lot of power plants like for times the condition of natural resources like wind even hydroelectric if there s a drought or something or not enough water flow you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant or anywhere Right because we ve found that solar is pretty cost feasible right Yeah it s not that expensive And actually you won t have to pay an electrical bill if you get that If you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something you re better off just using the solar panel It would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine or to have the solar panels power the turbine It doesn t power it It s just like another way to get energy at the same time that you re getting the wind When there s no wind there s not much of a wind That s what the battery s for Hmm interesting I have a question for solar power too For solar power how can I make aluminum more efficient in the future Well it doesn t use a lot of the gas so it doesn t affect the environment So it doesn t affect your breathing And you don t need solar panels like you don t need to turn stuff on during the day because the sun through the windows can give you light and then can store up for the night Okay I have a question What natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future Like 50 or so years from now Wind It was used like 3 000 years ago so if it was used 3 000 years ago I think it would be used 3 000 years in the future That s not necessarily true because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes The problem with the wind thing is it can be used in country like rural areas because in other areas you can t put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood Because you can t can you put one You mean I could put one outside the school here Well it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school Well I d put it on top of the school because then there would be more wind higher up Right and we have to worry about spacing right Because we were saying wind power is built usually where On wind farms where you have a lot of flat land Because if you build in a mountainous region are you going to get a lot of the wind If it s high enough it ll probably be enough Then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning or being damaged that way Yeah that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down Right that s very possible So when you think about one energy source is there really one energy source to go with Or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live what s available Because again talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water Is there running water everywhere around the United States No No And what s the problem if you flood an area even if there is a running water what happens if you flood the area Well they have to decide Usually if it s going to be a major problem they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things That s mostly our United States rule But in China they really don t care So they flood three or four cities multiple towns fill up three gorges of water Wow That s just insane Because once you disrupt water flow you have a problem So again there are some pros and cons to these Okay we re going to take a second and we re going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use So if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with whether there was running water think you have those things beside you don t limit yourself there but turn to your neighbor for a minute and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2 Because each one of you might have a different opinion Give each other a little bit of a reason why and we ll get back together in just a second Alright guys another 30 seconds Then we ll get back together Alright three two one Let s wrap up our conversations Alright How many people by show of hands went with one of the non renewable resources like coal oil or natural gas Cool So everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go Alright Ryan I think it s either wind or solar power How many people agree Oh so wind or solar is the clear choice Jonah why The thing is I think solar would be first Because solar energy you can use almost anywhere pretty much But the wind if you live here you can t get it as easily because there s not as much wind So it would be a lot easier to have solar because you can use solar anywhere because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere We think solar too because the sun is always there even if it is winter or it s a little cloudy the sun is still there Yeah but what about at night time So Maddy what did we find out about solar At night time like a lot of people go to work during the day so no one s at their house using their lights and stuff So there s a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house You still get some light at night bouncing off the moon Dustin what do you think I was thinking that solar energy would be great because I was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone and you have it plugged in and while it s plugged in it s fully charged and you can still use it and it won t un charge because it s still plugged into the wall But if the power goes out at your house then it will stop charging and you ll have that much battery left So it s kind of like if you re out in the day and your house is charging while there s still sun So you re still getting energy and at night time when the sun is gone you ll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing Well it s the same thing with wind power You d still have that battery there Yeah Wind power would be Would solar power still work during a storm It depends how severe the storm is So you mean this is like built to last Yeah if it gets struck by lightning I don t think it would still work But you know when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds right So that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day just at night you would still have to use the battery that s been stored Just like with wind power There is wind power all day long all night long but sometimes it does die down at certain times so there s a battery too there as well Exactly I agree with solar power but I agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things but I don t see the purpose of a solar farm It takes up a lot of land Just the point to collect the sun I think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant like wind power or something like that because And cost wise it would be probably expensive because it was 900 for just one of those panels And Miss Shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house That s basically about 10 800 For one house But we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines Just imagine random winter lines in your front yard Yeah but we saw pictures or a video of a solar powered house and most people don t like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house Same with the wind power wind turbines would look unattractive But you can still decorate them if you want You can t really do that with the wind power I mean solar power thing because it s mostly black That s a good thought So going forward thinking of an energy solution because as you guys get older energy is going to be something you have to worry about We ve seen the gas prices The gasoline prices for regular cars go up You ve seen the ethanol being developed Is it good to keep developing new technologies How many of you guys once you start driving think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you would drive a hybrid car I would Okay would you drive a hybrid car Yeah I would drive one because it s more in miles per gallon and with rechargeable cars you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money That s good Also the emissions from your gas 
 Consider what you read about organic lettuce and Rosie from Omnivore s Dilemma and from what you re reading do you feel it s worth the extra cost and effort to eat organic Yes So for some organics I believe it is worth it and others I don t Industrial organic I don t believe it s worth it because for the lettuce in the book Omnivore s Dilemma they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce and I don t believe that s energy efficient at all But other farms other industries or other organic farms like Polyface Farms they use all natural energy not a lot of fossil fuels go into it and I think it s more efficient So organic like that I believe is better but industrial organic I don t believe is better That s a good point I was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic Phil if you want to pick someone Eli So normal organic food like what started the idea of organic food was completely different from organic food that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays Like what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local sustainable farm like Polyface Farms where it s completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals But industrial organic systems it s pretty much the same as normal industrial food system except they don t use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food They still have animal rights There s still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories and stuff like that Araceli I agree with Eli because when I read organic I thought organic was good But then basically it was the same thing Like the chickens they still got fed corn but they had an open door but they were so fat they couldn t go through Like why pay the extra money for something that s going to be exactly the same as the other thing I think it is worth buying organic food Because even though the animals are treated the same and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel we save a lot of farmland from being put like pesticide and everything on it so we could have chemical free land And also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use So it might cost a little bit more but it s worth it Matt In response to I guess Eli it s not exactly the same there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones But yes I can definitely agree that it s a very similar thing it doesn t solve all the problems with the industrial system I don t agree with what was just said that when you farm without pesticides it s better because in Omnivore s Dilemma even though they farm without pesticides they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land So it s not necessarily better it just sounds better I just like Simone s point because I think that a lot of the problems are still there and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides I think it s still important to eat real organic food I think that would be the best Industrial organic is a step in the right direction but I don t think it s close enough to where we should be with our food system I agree with Molly that industrial organic foods on the face are both They re worth paying for because they re the food that we should be eating but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution If you want the right type of food you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the United States but still has healthy animals And animals that have evolved to eat only being fed that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the United States like we are fed now I was going to also ask a couple personal questions since I was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change do you think now that you feel like you re more aware or She says that she always bought grass fed beef and I try to eat healthy but in the case of fast food of course I go and eat fast food But lately I ve been badgering her and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak I ve been waiting for that for a long time The corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad so Anyway There s nobody asking I don t think organic s really necessarily healthy for us because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need what essentials we still need Like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed So how can we tell organic s good for us if we don t know what organic is different from what we get from normal food I thought Curt brought a good point up too which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers but it is a great point that Curt and Greg brings up which is that that way can t feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food I completely agree with that It s implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy We read in the Omnivore s Dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day that s a lot of land for very little meat and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country Lisa So I kind of agree with what you re saying but it doesn t have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic If there s little farms all over the United States then meat can go to those people around there It might not happen all of a sudden but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better Whether it s more expensive or not it s healthier for us knowing that the animals When the animals are not fed on natural stuff that in turn is bad for us Ashley I agree with what everyone said and that the point that Paulina brought up about we re still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what s good for us Because I feel like it s more better to spend even just a few more cents if organic food isn t that expensive and go to certain places A few more cents on the local home grown organic food because I used to buy meat from the What s it called The meat section The deli Deli yeah there you go And I used to buy meat there and I thought it was all fine you know whatever until I went to the doctor one day because I was getting really injured and she was like You re missing all these vitamins and she gave me all these vitamins to take And I didn t know that that was missing inside my food and then I go to the organic section of the supermarket and it s not even like vitamins that were missing in the meat it s vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food For example like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there just because it s like naturally grown and organic So I was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health So I feel like if people realize how important it is for your health that scare will wake them up and they ll be able to spend the dollar Okay well I agree I think that it s worth the extra cost for organic because like in the book it said when we buy organic food we re voting with our forks and we re voting for the type of food we want And if we go organic then the producers will think that most of us want organic so they ll start growing more and selling more organic food so that it might become cheaper in the long run I personally don t really care Like if it s cheaper that s cool because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off And animal s rights are nice but they re going to be killed anyway It s like they re all going to die anyway They re going to die so Michael I like it And yeah I mean even though organic s good we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income So we might not be like the healthiest nation but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the United States So I kind of like that They don t have to worry about paying high prices for food even though it s bad for my health And even if it is bad I could just exercise So I think it s a personal responsibility to watch what you eat So we should be open to that Even with the industrialized food system we re still not feeding everyone If you go to like the Appalachians and stuff like that you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don t make enough money to buy even the cheap food So I think that it s not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go I think we need to worry about cost later on and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to Lisa I see how you brought up the Appalchians but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here where it effects us or would you find it more important to focus like worldwide Like you could focus on problems that people have outside but like wouldn t you focus on start here make sure that we have what we need first and then branch out I think that with that like with a lot of people who get stuff locally So if you re saying locally like are you talking like Chicago Don t you think it s better to start locally and then Like we get better locally and then we get better statewide and then we ll go on until everybody has enough money to do this or their food everyone can buy their food I think so but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in Illinois that doesn t guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies And I think if we focus on doing something for United States and worry less about the other countries even though politically it might not be the right thing to do worry less about the other countries at this time But I think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing okay how can we make this better on a local level Chris I think that we can t really make it perfect like the way Polyface Farms is because of how the cities are laid out Because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there So I think what we have to do is have this industrial organic which still is I mean a lot more worth it because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil and I read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of New Jersey was like a dead zone at the end of the Mississippi River and the Gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down And that s problem that we should focus on Well I agree with Teresa that we should start only in the US because we can t just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are We only know that the US is eating unhealthy because according to Omnivore s Dilemma King Corn and Food Incorporated the problems are only occurring in the United States So if we want to solve this problem we should start from the origins because we started using corn massively creating problems and stuff not because of other countries Well maybe because we imported corn from Mexico and they dominated out other corn types so we started using corn But we should start focusing on more of what s the problem over here instead of other countries because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems maybe Yeah I was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic because even if it s just a little bit of farms here and there people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food Like in Polyface Farms people came from hundreds of miles I think or 100 miles just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food And with Jerry I wanted to say that Well nevermind Okay then So I remember Gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in America and that s the issue we should be working on But that s really what the food industry does like making the most food possible They pretty much put everything else aside besides mass production They don t really care about animal rights or worker safety or anything like that They just put as much work as they can into making more food and like Gabby said people in America still can t afford this food that s cheaper than it s ever been in the past So it just shows that really we can not go back to just normal farms because there s no way just natural farms like Polyface could ever sustain a population as big as America Like we kind of dug ourselves into a hole Yeah Okay so what do you think we should do then If we ve dug ourselves If we ve dug ourselves into this hole even though if we re going to be producing less food that s better quality I agree that is better because then you re taking the animal rights into consideration the workers rights and everything But then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat and so people are eating a bigger variety of food or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone Because at the end of the day either we re going to have a lot of people who die because we change this and we change it too fast and we re not ready to adapt to it or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives Eli Okay well I think that we should really just follow the model of like France or some other country in Europe or something Because they have a way better People in France are so much healthier than people in America and they don t eat nearly as much food They still aren t starving most people in France aren t starving or anything So there are countries it s just not left them Okay I don t know if this makes sense but if they have like 20 000 chickens in one pen do they have to feed them corn Like what s wrong with mass production but making it a little healthier Why can t they just give them something else that s maybe not all corn maybe half corn or half corn to little corn And then metaphorically speaking this totally reminds me of Hitler and like how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything and that s like what they re doing with the animals They re just working them to death and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever Deja I think the answer to your question is that most people just want money so they ll buy whatever s cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money I think that s the answer to your question about why don t they just choose another food instead of corn I think it s because of money But also consider what about What about the industrial organic Doesn t that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed Even though they re raised in coops They re still fed corn Molly Okay so I think that it s a really good idea that Matthew brought up a while ago that the industrial issue it can t really be solved by using beyond organic I think we ve moved on from that We can t really go back to beyond organic because we wouldn t be able to feed enough people And then just to Adam s point I don t think that we re not producing enough food I think the problem is that the people don t have enough money for the food So I think that producing more food wouldn t really help I was going to say everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody But if you think we actually waste a lot of food too That s actually important I think we saw a picture or something all of it gets thrown out every day or they have ads on it on TV If we re so worried about feeding everyone why don t we eat better ourselves and stop buying so much food we don t actually eat Well either whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside I like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea Whether it s taking France s ideas and taking it onto ourselves or just ourselves spreading it out Because so obnoxious they would go out to McDonald s my family and be like Do you know what that eats And then just start talking We re like Shut up don t tell me what it eats I m going to eat it And now my mom asks me she s like Is this good And then I read it I m like Yeah it has this and this and this And now she turns to me and like asks me should we buy this should we not So I think I have changed a little bit at least having been 
 So these two are gonna combine and make six X squared Yes Okay and then what about this guy Just bring him down Alright what about her You can bring her down Okay That s a four X to the fourth not four X squared Ah thank you Four X to the fourth And is this term positive or negative Positive And what about this term Positive And what do we call this guy Rock on okay good good good Alright easy one you ready Three X times X squared plus four X minus two And this time we re multiplying what kind of monomial is that Linear Linear good Times a quadratic what Trinomial Trinomial awesome Go ahead and distribute that and see what you get When you think you have an answer do you wanna show it to the person next to you and see if you agree or disagree with each other Alright alrighty So Any exciting disagreements No Nothing No one differs from anyone else No Larry Thayer He just forgot to write his down Okay but now you re cool So everybody either feels like they got the same thing or they fixed what thought they had Alright that s boring Okay so what do get when you your first product done Three X cubed Alright and then 12 X squared And then Six X And then Nothing it s simplified It s done Okay So we ended up with a cubic trinomial Now here s what I wanna show you Somethin a little different because what s the raise your hand if you can tell me the verb we did here Cubic We been talkin the verb Distributed We distributed and we also what Simplified Which one s right They re both we simplified and we used distributing in order to simplify Okay so I m gonna put a verb up here And I ll even put distribute because that s specifically what we did Now here s what I m gonna do I m gonna give you a different thing I m gonna give you this I m gonna give you four A cubed plus two A squared minus 10 A And I m gonna spice this up just a little bit I m sorry about that change that 10 A to a 40 A Alright It s already simplified It s already simplified okay So I can t give you simplify for a verb I m gonna give you a different verb Now there s a better word than what I m about to put up here This isn t really a math word we re gonna replace it with a better one very shortly And here s a clue Undistributed How do you undistribute Let s shove this expression that you said s already simplified in a time machine Imagine you got like a have you guys ever seen like fast feed photography where there s a seed And it s like they speed up the footage and you see the seed germinate and you see the little stem grow and it s kind of all jerky and everything Okay can you imagine playing that backwards and you have a little sprout and it goes back in and it ends up as a little seed Right Imagine that this was on the page as a final answer and we put it in backwards to see how it might have started as a math problem Do you use the You can do that Do you use like the factor tree Say that a little louder Alec Do you use the factor trees Alec that s interesting that you asked Alec is asking about our warm up problem today which was a throw back to when you guys were in elementary school and you talked about things called factor trees And with factor trees we talk about how you can take a number and use a sledgehammer and kind of bust it up into it s what To it s factors To its factors and we keep goin until we can t do it anymore right Huh The deal with that is you have to figure out what was originally inside and outside of the parentheses You just gotta kinda ignore the A I guess Even ignoring the A like I don t know if putting it in a facts tree you really put it into parentheses Cause you don t really have a whole lot to work with there to put it back into parentheses I don t know It s kinda going against every fiber of my being and Like why would you make a math problem out of a perfectly nice number Yeah Okay that s interesting we ll come back to that cuz that s a really good point Why would you take like a 12 and turn it into a math problem what good does that do Yeah what good is that We ll come back to that that s an excellent question With big answers Yes sir what do you think I forgot what I was gonna say Ya sure Lauren what d ya think Isn t this kinda like checking it Lauren just said something interesting She said Isn t it kinda like checking it So when you check an equation for example what do you do Put it back in So when you solve an equation it s kinda like tying a knot And then when you put it in put in the solution and you check it it s kinda like untying the knot to see if comes out the same way But we don t have an equation to plug those into You re right Carolyn what were you gonna say Okay so you know how yesterday I know this is kind of off subject but I That s okay You know how yesterday like you showed us this problem on our worksheet and it was like three times the binomial or whatever When you said we were gonna do those today Can you be specific with the problem so I know what exactly It was number 50 on Oh oh you mean the problems that look like this Yeah the ones that we said we ve already done but we really haven t Like this And you guys wanted to make this what did you wanna make this X squared oh it feels so right doesn t it We ll come back to that in a second That is sort of related to this What were you gonna say Zach and then we ll take a closer look I was just gonna say couldn t there be different like when you unsimplify that couldn t there be different answers Or is there only one correct answer Can someone restate what he s sayin here Or what do you think he means by that Sam what do you think he means by that I think he means that when like you unsimplify it it can be with the two parentheses or it can be with one parentheses and the term in front of it So you re sayin maybe it s like this and there s something here Or maybe it s like this Yeah Cause this looks I ll tell you this looks an awful lot like the answer we got here And this didn t start off with a number that was distributed necessarily like this one It started off like this didn t it How do you figure out how to throw it backwards Cause that s just like You know what let s start with the easier one Which one of those is less complicated the blue one or the orange one The blue one I d agree let s start with this way and then maybe we can go up to the orange So if I wanted to again this is not a math term we re gonna use a better term in a little bit If I were to quote undistribute or use a vacuum cleaner to suck something out of all three of these terms would you agree that it has to be the same thing that we suck out of each one In other words can I pull a four out of this and an eight out of this yeah Okay Any suggestions Let s just focus on the coefficients any suggestions on what I can pull out A two A two okay Anything else Four Can I pull a four let s go door to door Can he give me a four Can he give me a four Can she So if there was a four out there I would have to think what was in there to distribute a four two to make two I m gonna avoid fractions here Yeah see he s avoiding fractions I could I could technically pull out anything But with the factor tree we did at the beginning of class typically when you talk about that s a good point When we talk about factors we stick with whole numbers Okay Or maybe even integers but we usually don t go into fractions Sam what re you thinkin To unsimplify it couldn t you put in one of those boxes that we did yesterday for the terms Like put it in the middle and then find what it is Oh yeah Why you re talkin when we were doing this And then ask ourselves what would go here that s a weird question mark What would there and what would go there That s interesting Alec what are you thinking Couldn t you take out an A with that two Like on the problem Since it all has A s If you can take out a can you put out an A like you took out the two Can he give up an A Yes Can he give up an A Yes She give up an A Yes Well let s try that let s try that that s interesting So if I were to quote and again we re not gonna use this word much after the next Would you if you were to quote undistribute a two A from four A cubed what would that look like What would have to be here It would have to be a two A squared Well okay let s keep goin and then we ll check to see if this makes sense I ll get your question in one second Caroline So then what would be next So the two from the two would leave a ghost one And then the A from the A squared would be a what Oscar I was thinkin one A One A alright I d like that And then the two A from the negative 40 A would be a what Negative 20 Negative 20 A So now we re back to what Justin said We ve taken a perfectly nice simplified polynomial and turned it into a math problem Let s see if this is even right What do you think we could do to check ourselves like Lauren suggested Do the problem What do you mean do the problem Simplified Okay so let s simplify it real quick What s two A times two A and no peeking Four A squared What s two A times two A cubed I mean squared Four A cubed good And what s two A times A That s two A squared What kind Positive two A squared And two A times negative 20 Negative 40 A Oh it worked Yeah I have a question Yes ma am What exactly is the point of this That s an excellent question Shhhhhh ready Why on earth would you do such a horrible rotten thing Well one day shhhh One day what if you had this beast Holy Cow Whoa Do you guys know where to start No I don t know But check this out Didn t you just say we could take this and turn it That s the same thing we had right So can I factor that and turn that into two A times two A squared plus A minus 20 Are you cool with that Are you okay if I just leave the bottom Two A squared plus A minus 20 Anybody have an idea what might happen now Did you guys know that you ve been doin that since the fourth grade No Yes you have Just with much less obnoxious numbers What does 16 32 what does that let me use another What does that simplify to Here s why you guys probably already knew this Let s leave the 16 alone and isn t 32 two times 16 Yeah Ohhh That s the math That s the math that justifies simplifying fractions like you ve been doin since you were like eight years old That s cool What other occasion this is gonna be helpful How do you undo plus or adding when you re solving equations Subtraction Subtraction you call in the opposite right How do you undo multiplication You divide Divide well here s what we re leading up to How are you gonna undo the squared Factoring busts up the squared for us And it s gonna be a very important tool when we re solving what kind of equations do you think we can call these Think about it Look at the degree Oh quadratic Quadratic equations Alright let s take a look at another one Let me have you undistribute one again We need a better word for this Did we call this unmulltiplying No What did we call the verb here what was the verb on this Division
