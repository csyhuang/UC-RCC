the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word worm worm w w what letter w good job we have been talking about spring and we have been talking about the seasons of summer and winter and springtime what season are we in right now winter winter very good well this book hedgehog is hungry that s written by beverley randell is about a hedgehog and he is asleep during the wintertime and he wakes up in the springtime and he is hungry but first look at this picture have y all ever seen anything like this before no i saw a hedgehog in a book but not real you ve seen a hedgehogs before in a book but not real not me hedgehogs are pokey and when they curl up their little spikes poke out they pop up that s right why do you think they pop up cuz that means you re scared that means they re scared nature protects if a person runs into the pointy stuff they ll say ouch that s right and it protects them well as we are reading this book today we re going to read this book to find out what hedgehog is going to eat what hedgehog is hungry for and what he is going to eat i want you to look at your partner and i want you to tell your partner what you think hedgehog might eat i am thinking he is going to eat a worm i think he is going to eat a snail okay alright well i heard i heard worm and i heard snail and she said snail too why do you both think the hedgehog is going to eat a snail because there s one right in front of it i think it s going to eat a worm you think it s going to eat a worm i think he s going to eat a leaf you think he might eat leaves okay alright so we re going to read this book to find out what hedgehog is going to eat alright why are we reading this book to find out what hedgehog is going to eat but guess what there s going to be some words in this book that we might not know how to read one of the words we are going to work on today is new high frequency word and remember high frequency words there aren t any rules for them are they we just have to learn the way they look so that we can learn to read them can you read tell me what this word is here this is the word here i love how you decoded it we already learned about it we have learned about here here is on our word wall word wall isn t it excellent job well today it is important that you not only know how to read words but it s important that you also know how to spell words so i m going to give you the letters that you need i want you to dump them out and i want you to spell here for me i m going to turn this around so you can t look at it and i want you to spell here for me i hear lilly saying it s here i spelled it alright i m going to turn it back around are you all ready alright check it h e r e i did it are you all right what word did you just build here here alright now we can build it so i want you to write it i want you to write the word here not look at your letters okay are you ready show me how you write the word here and then i ll let you check it again you re almost there what else do you think comes next i think you push harder you want to try pushing harder you think you got it natalia i put an exclamation mark here you put an exclamation mark at the end i spelled it you did alright i m going to turn it around you all ready to check it did you get it alright read your word here here very good h a r e here here it s not a alright now one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high frequency words and learning all of our high frequency words our high frequency words are on our word wall so that s one place that you can look if you get stuck another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part so we re going to go through and that s what we re going to do right now we are going to look at the pictures are you ready hedgehog is hungry that s our title now what time of year do you think it is winter winter it is definitely winter because all of the leaves are off the tree because all of the leaves are off the tree alright let s look at the pictures now who do you see buried down in the leaves there i see hedgehog you see hedgehog is hedgehog awake or is he asleep asleep and you know why he s asleep because it s winter and he hibernated and he s hibernating very good turn to the next page now what season is it what season is it it s spring it s spring and is hedgehog still asleep no no hedgehog is awake let s turn to the next page and there he goes here he comes he s going out for a little walk what do you think he s doing find something to eat he s going to find something to eat let s turn to the next page hedgehog is hungry and what is the first thing he finds he finds a snail i was right uh you were right and me okay let s turn to the next page he s still hungry he ate worms and caterpillar okay now that is a very big word caterpillar how did you all know that that was the word caterpillar i saw it right there alright listen closely you all just told me two strategies you can use to help yourself when you come to a tricky word you can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound or you can look at the pictures tell me again you can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound or you can look at the pictures okay let s turn to the next page now what does he find what is that okay we talked about one of the strategies is we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound alright let s run our finger underneath it now let s look at it let me write it let s do bug let s spell bug and see how would we spell bug get your arms ready is that going to be the word bug no no so we re going to have to look at that this is the word beetle can you say that word beetle and look underneath it what do you see underneath it that is a slug ooooh now just like eyes are up here lilly eyes are up here okay there we go just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound you all also know how to decode words is everybody s eyes up here so we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend which is sl what sound is the u going to make uh because there s only one vowel and what sound s the g going to make guh let s blend it together are you ready sl u g slug now look at me you have three ways now you can look at the pictures you can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound and you can decode words that have one vowel in them alright let s close our book up all the way up when you are reading i want you to read to find out what hedgehog eats what is your purpose for reading to find out what hedgehog eats alright start reading hedgehog is hungry what did we say he was use the pictures to help you with the tricky part we said he was a asleep asleep good job it wasn t doing that space in there that s right because asleep is one word there s our high frequency word here i m tricked you re tricked alright so what will you do h un gry hungry very good hedgehog is hungry good job slug good job it does spell the word spring good job alright i love the way you all did two things i love the way you can all use your fingers to help you point i saw lilly stretching lots of words out when she came to a word that she didn t know she got her mouth ready and she stretched those out just like we did with the word slug i saw poniyota using the pictures help her with the tricky part we are reading to find out what hedgehog ate do you remember what hedgehog ate snails he ate snails what was something else he ate a snail a snail what was something else he ate a bug a bug what was something else he ate he ate a beetle bug a beetle bug alright let s read it and make it sound like talking hedgehog is hungry hedgehog is hungry winter is here hedgehog is asleep spring is here hedgehog wakes up here comes hedgehog let s all get together here we go hedgehog is hungry here is a snail hedgehog is hungry here is a worm here is a caterpillar here is a beetle here is a slug hedgehog is hungry in the spring very good job i am very proud of you all,0.0
how s everybody today good good okay we are gonna work our bodies real hard today and we are gonna play a game called wellness uno how many people raise your hand if you ve ever played uno absolutely put your hands down do you know that there are four colors in uno who knows what one color is alexis what is it blue what s another one um red red what s another one nate yellow yellow green green absolutely okay we ve got the uno cards spread all around the circle here first graders and what we re gonna do is in just a minute you re gonna come up here and you re gonna get an uno card i might pick this one right here this one is a green four green four okay i look at it and then i put it right back if you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones point to where the green color zone is boom you got a green cone over there stay right there watch ms miller the green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station so if this is you have choices when you come over here first graders choice number one you can get a rope and you can swing how many times four four swing four times which rope would be easier to swing on alexis the knot one the knot one cause you can hang on to it better that s right so you can swing or can come over here and you can do those bicep curls that we ve been working on in muscular strength and endurance stand right here to the wall and do that four times nice and what slow slow absolutely and here s your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station if i got what was my number again four four look there s four hula hoops on the rock wall you would start here and you would go through hula hoop one then hula hoop two three four what happens if i had a green two how many hula hoops would i go through paige how many would i go through two just two okay so it s either four whatever number that is that s the number of hula hoops you go through then i come back over here and i pick another card hmm did i pick this one oh i just picked that one let s pick this one what color s that yellow three yellow three point to the yellow color zone absolutely the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone and guess what you have to do here first grade there is a cone here and it says yellow add zero what was my number three three and if i add a zero to that what does that make that number thirty thirty that s what we re gonna have to do i have my choice i have to do thirty of something over here here are my choices i m gonna do thirty oh gonna work my heart thirty step boxes or if i don t wanna do that i can do the ball on the stick how many times thirty thirty and if i m really good and if i really wanna try i can get a jump rope right there on the wall and i can try jump roping thirty times now i m gonna run back here and i m gonna get another card and i m gonna get this one right here this one is a red six uh oh red nine red nine it s a red nine see where that line is under there so that means it s a nine red nine point to the red color zone woo you guys are so smart i come over here to the red color zone and look what does the red color zone have on it times two times two so what was my number nine nine what s nine times two say it alexis eleven not eleven this is hard what s nine plus nine what is it nathan do you know what is it ethan 18 it s 18 so we re gonna do 18 ms miller will help you with the math if you don t know so we re gonna times that one by two and here are my choices i m gonna come over here and i m gonna get a paddle and i m gonna this is a hand eye i m gonna use my hands and my eyes i m gonna put my safety strap on and i m gonna do how many of these 6 9 18 18 that s right 18 and first grade how can i challenge myself at this station if i wanted to make this station harder for myself how would i do that courtney um use your left hand use your other hand ms miller is left handed so if i use my left hand i would use my right hand so if you want to challenge yourself you d use your other hand so you re gonna do that how many times 18 18 okay so that s you could either do that at this station or i love these these are the i call them the ice cream cones look you throw that ball and you re gonna catch that ball do it again that s how many two two and you re gonna do that all the way til you get to whatever number you have at that station that was using your hands and your eyes watching that ball right into that cup and now i m gonna come over here and i m gonna get one more and oh i just grabbed that one let s see what s oh what s this number blue blue six where s the blue color zone point where s the blue color zone over there hey the blue color zone is balancing watch ms miller over here you re gonna come over here and if you don t wanna touch the gym floor ethan sit down for me you re gonna step on the stepping stones and you can either step on the sides of the ladder or if you wanna make it harder for yourself you can step on these rungs and balance all the way to the bleachers step up come across and then we re gonna go on this balance beam hey first graders when we re balancing do we go fast or slow slow slow we go slow we don t wanna go fast at this station because we wanna have good balance and we don t wanna fall we wanna make sure we don t touch the gym floor so that s wait what was my number again i forgot nine it was a nine red how many times would i go then nine nine times around there or your choice is the hippity hops now ms miller s a little big for this hippity hop but you kinda get the idea you just use the boing hop hop to the black line it s one and then back is how many two so i would do that nine times okay those are your choices so there s four stations yellow red excuse me green and blue turn around and face ms miller now i wanna talk to you about something really quick it s something called personal integrity you ready back there ethan everybody sit on your bottoms sit on your bottoms personal integrity and first does anybody know what personal integrity is do you think you know maddie when you hear that what do you think that means listening listening okay what do you think maria if you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card you can t put it back and get the one you want ah wow do i like that definition absolutely personal integrity this is the way i think of it is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching you said it maria you know what my favorite i really like those swing ropes over there i really like to do that would i have personal integrity if i came over here and i did this i got a card and it s like ooh blue i don t wanna go to blue i wanna put that back ooh there s another blue i don t want that would i have personal integrity if i kept picking cards until i got what i wanted no can ms miller watch every person get a card no no so you have to have some personal integrity whatever card you get that s the one what happens if i just got a blue card and i come over here and i pick another blue one what am i gonna do what am i gonna do paige you put it back down and you get another one but not the same one no no no we re not gonna get another one we re going to what it s okay you just go back to the blue station that s right you re just gonna go back to the blue station and just maybe if you did the hippity hops maybe do the balance drill next time outstanding okay we re gonna get started this is what i want you to do oh i forgot one more rule when you get a card do you ever run across the indian no do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out we don t wanna bump into anybody nelson do you have a question do you have a question about something you d probably rip the card you would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself hands down let s get started i m gonna call months of the year and if i call your month of the year that your birthday is in then you re gonna get up and you re gonna go get a card are you ready if you have a birthday in january february or march go get a card how bout april may and june july august september october november and december let s go what d you get chris let s see man what is that talk to me red eight red eight do you know what eight plus eight is eight plus eight think about that almost 16 go do 16 of those good job buddy hey paige you wait on the end of the mat there until alexis is done what s your number alexis four don t hold the bottom grab up at the top like brian is doing that s perfect yeah what was your number one what was it one one did you do one do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card ooh steven steven what d you get man what is it blue seven it s a blue seven go hey ethan what d you get now remember the line means what a yellow six okay what are you gonna do with that yellow six wait come here look at me you re gonna put a no you re gonna add a what to the end of that a zero and that makes it what number 60 yeah let s go woo look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station they are going up up down down they are getting their heart rates up what number did you have maddie um 50 50 holy moly keep counting it goes like this maddie up up down down that s one every time you hit the ground that s one okay woo be careful that s okay just hold it up like this watch watch you see how it whirls like this at the bottom there you go like that it can get pretty hard yeah chris i saw one card that was um um it was turned over oh did you so i flipped it over oh really thank you so much i appreciate you taking care of the cards for me here you go five times two what s five plus five ten ten that s what it is jamie what d you get forty forty did you get four yellow go woo look at these hippity hops over here outstanding man are you guys doing a good job i like how you re going really slow at this station that s good balancing ooh chris way to get your balance back slow down buddy woah nelson i know can you put one foot in front of the other can you bring your other foot in front wanna try it ms miller s right here in case you have to grab onto me yeah look at that what a good balancer you are i balance on the monkey bars you balance on the monkey bars yeah woo good job you did it good job all right what d you get buddy blue four hey are you supposed to have your card with you i ll go put it back for you remember to leave the card hey jane did you run through the middle of the indian did you forget don t do it again go on stay on the floor way to practice how s it going over here paige and ethan keep your eye right on that ball ooh paige that was close right on there good job how bout you come over here what is eight times two what s eight times two paige do you know that that s a hard one nine eight plus eight eight plus eight kids six times two what s six plus six six and six put the two sixes together 12 12 that s what it is just keep going there s new music coming on there s new music coming on first grade keep it going way to go there nelson i like that woo your arms hurt you re getting a lot of good muscular strength what d you get here let s see what is that yellow seven what are you gonna do to that seven you re gonna put a what on the end of it a what are you gonna put on it a zero what does that make it 70 go woo maddie you got a blue nine yes no kidding don t go running what is that card a yellow four and what are you gonna add to that four,0.0
okay you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday what we realized or what i realized is that there s still confusion on going from the general to factor general to vertex or vice versa on any of those three particular forms also another objective we re gonna do is we re gonna figure out determine why each form is important so the first thing i want you guys to do is i want you guys to look at number one on that task card can someone read it out loud i will yeah drew the angry bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters the bird s initial velocity was 14 7 meters per second write an equation that gives the height of the angry bird as a function of time okay so what i need you guys to do is i need you guys to write that equation on the white board okay so now i want people to put it up on the board okay okay so can you guys look around to each other too i know you guys are gonna want to like show everybody what people are getting yay cool okay guys these are the four things or the three things that i saw okay so right here so if you notice a lot of you guys you guys had the first one negative four point nine x squared plus 14 7 x plus 49 can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out you just did it what was the question so can someone tell me how like relate this general formula to the story since you ve read already i wants someone else to speak so who okay jamilah can you explain how you were able to get this equation so the height is c and the original equation is a x squared plus b x plus c and so the initial height is b which is the y intercept and then b is the initial velocity and then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose so you guys is it random no it s the scale factor is there any other terminology for that it s the starting point hey guys do you think it s the starting point is it the starting point or what else it s gravity so wait what does this negative four point nine mean that s the constant remember it s gravity so i heard scale factor okay scale factor but relatively to your projectile motion what is it acceleration acceleration so you guys it s acceleration so right now what i want you guys to do oh actually once again right here here are different forms of an equation that i saw so right here what do you think can someone tell me what s wrong with this particular one they don t have a squared and they don t have an x after the 4 2 okay so ravelle what s the problem with this one there s no y intercept or so once again i still notice now i want to go back to the original equation okay someone tell me in words ah jamilah she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a x squared plus b x plus c but according to the story can someone refer to the story back to the general equation can you rephrase the question yes how are we able to get 14 7 here how did we get 49 here how do you know what stuff to use the 49 is the initial height in meters so that one s gonna be your y intercept and 14 7 is the initial velocity and the initial velocity is always b so awesome so now what i want you guys to do is i want you to go to number two so i want you to put that on the white board can i read it again well actually no let s have fatima can you read number two what does the x axis represent in this story what does the y axis represent in our story okay let s do that quickly i have a question yes did x never mind i ll wait until after this so let s look around so a lot of people are getting what x equals time y equals height so markeisha what was your question i was gonna say could x be distance as well can x be distance people no no if it wanted to why not because it s meters per second not meters per so does that make sense all right so now what i want you guys to do so so far let s recap what we ve done so far can everyone generalize what we ve just done in the first couple of questions we set up the equation and we figured out our x and y axes in the general form okay right now what i want you guys to do is i want you guys to work on number four okay someone read that out loud that hasn t read out loud yet i haven t so leslie you want to read number four from the equation that you got from question number one show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form now what i want you guys to do i want you to turn and talk about the strategies you re planning to use to work out this problem okay you guys i m gonna stop class real quick you guys i m gonna stop class real quick okay so mary can you just ask the question that you just asked me she asked me okay so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about so markeisha jamilah can we use the box to figure it out yeah you can why how hang on put that back away so you guys so the question is okay so autumn just asked can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to and why you guys you guys let s listen please mary sorry you figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers so if you divide negative four point nine x squared by negative four point nine you ll get x squared 14 7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three and then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten okay i ll stop you right there so back to what i said okay so the diamond rectangle method people so when you are doing this what are you finding we re finding the box you re finding the box so what are those things outside of the box here what are they called the factors the factors okay okay when you re using it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula what are you trying to find then all right so right now so autumn so you have questions on that right so later on so do you mind just moving over there real quick because leslie said that you got it down so you guys so take two more minutes we re gonna see both methods so are you done yet no okay you guys stop okay right now i m gonna put this up right here we re gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do okay so right now so how many people got negative five and two no no no so what was it negative two oh okay i got negative two and five my bad okay so right now what do you think was the mistake that she did she didn t square it she didn t what she didn t square and then she re fixed it she fixed it yeah she copied mine it s supposed to be negative 14 7 is that what its supposed to be yeah and is that what she s missing yeah okay guys so that s one mistake that happens quite a bit also let s look at hey you guys what form is this right here what method did they use box and diamond method box and diamond method right okay so you guys what do you call these two items right here what is it missing the number at the beginning the negative four and what is that again what is the name of the four point nine again scale factor or what acceleration acceleration so you guys if you notice this is something that tends to be missing also so now we will look at ah we have the same thing we all have the same thing so same thing same thing all right okay so right now i think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend oh actually so now what i want is so how many methods do people use two okay so tell me one what was one method what was the method that you used quadratic formula okay caleb what was another method that people used the box and diamond the box and diamond right so right now i want people to explain their thinking so what i want you to do is okay since tiffany since you said you did the quadratic formula you re gonna go up and talk about it just talk about the process of what you did how are you gonna explain the process all right so the can we do it on this hard board yeah okay let s do it on this hard board make sure you talk to us okay okay while you re writing things down talk about how you re going through the process so i used the quadratic formula so what are you doing right now i m writing it writing what the quadratic formula okay so you see instead of me asking i just want you to explain all the things that you re doing okay so you guys need some visuals this will be your a your b and your c so you plug all this into this okay so let s do it i have a question yes what if the b is already negative that s a good question so you guys while tiffany is doing the quadratic formula think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier and what mistakes that she may or may not have,0.0
i teach in a second and third grade combination class the students are arranged in grade level specific table groupings this allows students to complete any grade level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that s clear to them i also have a guided reading area and a independent reading corner all of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place as well as collaborative group work students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work they have a listening center where they access books on tape and cd we have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects or they do research on the internet but complete sentence okay for that first part all right and then someone who s taking turns so we re clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around questions if they make a mistake do you want us to correct their english or you know what what i think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak and i do this a lot so you might notice that i restate what someone has said and that s part of being a good listener so being able to recall or restate something like oh i heard you say and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate that s a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you re trying to teach and be a role model i have a different idea i think that is okay so there s another way i think that is excellent so we re going to just try this out and see how it goes we re going to try this out again and practice those cues are we the same number as usual yeah okay so here we go we re going to practice when you get to your pictures this is what i want you to do right now i have put i have this image of a whale on okay can you have a seat i need everyone sitting next to their partners right now so what i want you to do is looking at this picture i want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture what do you see so i want you to share exactly physical features and use descriptive language to talk about what you see question hold on a second sweetie i just called on jonathan just a second question we re going to describe with our partner so you re going to need to turn to your partner adam what did you i don t really understand what that thing in black is you know it s just a shadow it s a shadow this one it s just a shadow on the picture it just doesn t look very clear the way it came out it s the shadow on the image okay all right so turn to your partner when i ring the bell number ones share first when i ring the bell number twos share when i ring the bell i m going to take some of your descriptive language sharing what you see number twos okay excellent so i m going to pick a stick i m going to go fishing in my sticks and when i call your name i want you to share either what you saw or what your partner saw okay what was the detail that was shared and i m going to write it up on this sticky note because i m modeling now what you re going to do when you get to your stations everyone s going to get a stack of sticky notes and you re going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see number 10 cesar sorry you want to ask a question for a clarifying question no i was just making a comment just i don t like it when there s only like one sticky note for everyone because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see and it takes up like maybe three quarters of the whole paper and then the next group has like okay so we re going to solve that problem because each individual gets a sticky note okay and then you re going to choose where you re going to put it all right so number 10 cesar madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom and she said an orca and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth she actually named the animal which was an orca she saw white spots on the bottom and what was the part about the teeth and a few sharp teeth oh sorry and then sharp teeth okay so i wrote more than one idea on this sticky note but what you re going to do is after we do the conversation after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it then you re going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note and put it onto the picture so let s try one more i m going to turn it over so look at the picture and then i m going to ring the bell you re going to share and i ll pick somebody else to share what they see okay so who s next number 21 roberto my partner says oh what i said it can be what you said or what your partner said whatever you decide his was good i said that i see a pod of orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water that was great so he has two points that he sees the pod which is how we refer to a group a group excellent use of the vocabulary the orca whale so he s named the actual type of whale and he starts looking at the dorsal fins which is one of the physical features not only of the orca but of what the humpback doesn t the humpback that s right it doesn t have a dorsal fin so which ones have the dorsal fin all the others ones except for that one there s a couple of other ones as well blue whales don t blue whales good good good good good eyes up here are there any questions on what i want you to do when you go around to the different stations yes sarah so how many sticky notes are we going to get like a couple four or five so first i m going to give you a chance to walk around and then i m going to come around and i m going to give you some sticky notes so you re going to let us look at them and then we re going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on yes exactly exactly what s this this one s cool i see some baleen which means it s a baleen whale and it looks like it has a big mouth and the baleen looks like it is some sort of bendy thing and on the bottom of the baleen it s scary and it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale i see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies and a person s touching it i m not sure if it s a real whale that s alive it might just be an exhibit no jake and so i don t really think this is something that s underwater it s part of baleen it s like a baleen whale there s baleen but it looks like a blue whale because it is very big it also doesn t have any throat looms and it has just a small bump for it s dorsal it also looks like it s swimming very close to the top and that also looks like it s coming up for air i see a whale that a man is touching their teeth i m not exactly sure what type of whale this is but it s a whale i see someone touching part of a whale and it might be part of a baleen i see a whale and i think it s coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water i think that that is a baleen whale because it is it is white and it s a little bit gray i see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water and i believe that it s a beluga whale i see the whale i think it s going to jump out the water and then dive i see a big gigantic beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles and it doesn t have a dorsal fin,0.0
look i can be a serk now my whole house is great i can do anything good i like my school i like anything i like my dad i like my cousins i like my aunts i like my allisons i like my mom i like my sister i like my dad i like my hair i like my hair cuts i like my pajamas i like my stuff i like my room i like my whole house my whole house is great i can do anything good yeah yeah yeah i can do anything good better then anyone okay ok what cha learn from the video she can do anything ok what else she likes to sing be positive she likes to sing be positive what else what else did you learn about the video believe in yourself believe in yourself okay now how is this going to be related to our yearbook class stay positive about it people get a what s gonna what the outcome s gonna be okay and the outcome is something that we wanna be able to serve the entire school okay what else how is this also related to yearbook and what we re trying to accomplish we shouldn t blame ourselves i m sorry we shouldn t blame ourselves okay good good okay so what we re going to do after this this is a good start i think for the work that we re gonna be having to do this afternoon we re gonna have to work on our ladder and i know that we ve spent some time on it we ve had to make some considerable changes but i think that the compromise the agreement that we all talked about yesterday i think it can be implemented today so what we re gonna try to do is based on these are the signatures that we have allocated one signature for elementary school one signature for middle school and five signatures for the high school i think let s try to fit it in let s try to stay within the seven signatures don t forget we have ads also okay so i think tanisha and dustin and jazz will be on team one and sammy emily and colleen will be on team two let s work together what are the rules of getting the teamwork going when we re trying to discuss what are the things that i want you to think about everyone has a voice okay everyone has a voice what else we all have to agree to a middle ground okay and it s not just for the high school seniors okay so it s for the entire school the elementary school middle school and high school so let s be fair and try to get everybody involved what else discussion wise among yourselves what would i like you to be working on collaborative work compromise okay let s go ahead and start you have the books there you have copies of the previous ladder let s get it good yeah i understand elementary school middle school high school in what order it s up to you honey if you want to start with the middle school elementary school high school i don t know maybe just cause i m a senior i kinda like that plan it just seems weird starting at the elementary school i think it s just that they re not as important just that cause it s always started at high school it starts with the seniors and it s like this is what for okay now remember just because it s always done before i know but if we started with the elementary school we d be starting with the fourth grade and that s really our kind of an awkward place to start okay now remember with your signature you were gonna start with student life correct with the high school so you could start with that i mean look at it and you can see and then we re gonna start it with like the introduction um like um pictures student life candid shots right and then we re going to the seniors and all the senior stuff and our classes and then the sports and night clubs yes we re not gonna have a class class division page anymore cause all of the classes are scrambled are we still thinking like doing division pages like how it was worded originally except not for the classes because all the classes were split up yeah now it makes it easier to do your me right don t forget what s our theme me okay so keep that it mind when you re creating your signatures and i think now that solicited more allocated the sections are allocated your division pages maybe more adaptable they ll fit in there more yeah they ll fit in there more don t ya think i guess so should we just do one like just high school division page then middle school yes try it and see see now you might still need a division page for sports you might still need a division page but you don t need as many i think we definitely won t have one for the classes cause they re all split up they re already split up and i think this is what helped save us pages remember you re getting eight signatures um question yeah the yearbook two pages and ads is under the high school only because i just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end okay so whatever is your last section you have to have ads we have to start selling ads and again if you have any questions on the photographs sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want show the blood drive scales and then but their only sport is the seventh grade basketball everything else is going into high school does it make sense yeah yeah they all happened right there together are we still gonna do straight lines and single lines like they did i think we might just do a big column yeah we can still do that and then after our seniors we can explore all the classes in line and it makes sense if you have that quote yeah we are gonna do student life seniors all the senior stuff and then classes make sure that you have your page counts are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages i guess we could do school and then we would have to have the division pages that we thought of the spread division page with all the things it could just be different little division pages yeah okay so or like have the title at the top of the page don t forget she has control of the photographs so you need to consult with her okay you can ask her okay um so are we going to do a senior opening page i think we could just have an opening page on the division page i thought we were going to do the top instead of doing a collage how they put in their like the song and all that on the second page around all the photos we should put cause in our theme or whatever it s just a strip of pictures blended in the big picture so we re have written around it to add in these so i think that we should put these on the first opening page now remember we did this only because we had no choice i like well i like the happenings that we decided not to do for the opening page for the seniors because it s new life since our theme it s just one strip we could arrange it like this i think that we should put on that page we should put these oh definitely yeah good idea well what happened is the reason why i placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally it was so empty and it didn t mean anything so we went ahead and did that i think it would have been better to do that from the beginning and then we can have alex start doing the onward for two others do we want to put favorites before the formal i think we should put favorites so we re talking this one right these are the formals you want before the favorites no we want our favorites before our formals oh okay and then we re combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right yeah well you know what do you think well i like combining it can you pull up the other ladder do you still have that one if we have that picture and then another picture and then another this one is this the ladder you want to see which section do you want to pull student life i think it s on that right here yeah let me know because then i can go back and let her know so you want to start off with that so it ll be like the formal then the baby and then the quote can you tell emily what she missed yesterday about the quotes no were you present when you said that a lot of seniors who didn t have quotes last year they would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off if they can come up with their own and i have a quote book somewhere and we can start deciding we can go from very funny to very serious so the kids can have a good choice did you want me to go back to the other one how are you deciding the order is it just from serious to funny or well it s more funner stuff the memories into the more serious stuff and you re ending it with the grauduation yeah you rather repeat our homecoming but that s spirit week there s another one that s what homecoming fills this is the problem on the other ladder that we had the only high school student life we had was holten hemming and spirit week that s the same thing yeah hemming and spirit week like one spread and then the awards honors well that doesn t make up for all the signatures oh then we had prom you had the prom and then you had how about the senior the um sports banquet sports banquet should award everybody not just seniors yeah it s got uh do you want to put that under student i don t what if we you cut the prom down to one page but maybe we could put it back to two pages we could show like the planning of prom and setting it up okay but cause i m on the prom committee okay so and you have your committee meeting start taking pictures guys remember we have seven cameras so take cameras with you when you re having little meetings just make sure you re flexible enough just in case we don t have enough pictures you can flip back to one page instead of the signature i mean instead of a spread well i don t know how we re gonna fill up the signature then well you don t have to have we can move everything up and then we move seniors up into another half of the signature and that half would have to be colored because it s the senior signature um do you have a section for committee we had those in with the clubs with like all of their what they do in the community okay if you want you can bring it up a little more just the overall community that doesn t have a club and use up that space like the blood drive the blood drive is not part of the school rotary does that rotary yes but that s the interact is with rotary yes yeah we help with that we help rotary but you also do the victorian classic yes you don t have enough space you need to put the blood drive up i mean how much space breaks a spread oh interact has a spread yeah we ve covered this three times now okay sorry yes but we ve changed it three times so find other community things well if you want do you want to talk about the tax bill well that s not really student life it s going to affect your life yeah but,0.0
what i need you to do is you re going to be looking at both sets of data the one from october in the morning and the one from last week in the afternoon so i want you to work with your shoulder partners okay and the first thing i want you to look at this table you can do all three isabella you can come sit right here you re gonna work with your shoulder partners and i m just gonna take a second and i want you to see what is common what is in common how is the data aligned okay so i want you to work with your shoulder partners want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data okay where are you all standing what is the same between those two days you re looking from this day to this day overall what is the the heat that was trapped inside the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on and the black soaks in the heat so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers it traps it into okay y all figured out about the black look at your other you have three other kind of solar water heaters look there see what other types you can find what did y all find out the black cover covers it okay the black cover it s highest on both sheets on both sheets and what did you say white is the lowest and white uncovered is whites are lower than blacks and white uncovered is the lowest okay okay okay everyone find some similarities okay if you can hear me clap once if you can hear me clap twice okay just one thing don t tell me all the things that you have found the same table four what did you find that was the same in those sets of data elijah only one went down okay which one went down white uncovered okay so you saw that white uncovered went down what s another scientific word for going down everybody decrease okay so white under decrease in both okay what else did you find alex that the rankings were the same for each one okay and when you re talking about the rankings what are you meaning like white uncover had decreased the most uh huh um white covered was was really toward the middle uh huh black uncovered was also was the next one and black covered was the last one in order from the heat okay does everyone agree yes you all see the same thing now what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered what does that mean justin that black absorbed more heat okay that black maybe absorbed the most and what did the white do everybody it reflected it reflected or anthony what were you gonna say absorbed the least absorbed the least because it was reflecting now okay that was the easy part now i want you to look at your graphs and i want you to try to figure out things that are different okay things that are different this is a little tricky okay so you work with your partner try to figure out the things that are different okay okay and how does that relate to the results look at these results and how are these results different okay and so you have a wider range than you do the width okay so what were you saying now that i think that the they are so seperated out the first time we did it than last week okay girls what do y all think i think here it s like up now think about why it would be a lot closer ooh okay okay well let s take he said hotter the morning what was our temperature 24 24 and the afternoon what is so think about what y all talking about okay y all ready to report out okay if you can hear me clap once if you can hear me clap twice okay different give me one thing that was different stephanie they all got different angles okay the lines are different angles you re right what else chloe at 10 30 a m all of them had all of temperatures were higher as well as to the 2 30 p m higher temps in morning okay um what else kristin can you think of something else what do you think nick there s different air temperature okay there s a different air temperature okay what else just looking at the overall graph justin just looking at just the picture of the graph how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon all of the temperatures went got decreased in the in the um at 2 30 okay and when you say decrease which graph looked like this the morning or the afternoon the morning the morning which one looked like this the afternoon okay so overall the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon now why do you think that could be why do you think that could be kristen because it s like on the side oh okay here s our school okay this is where we did our experiment and kristen s saying that the morning time the sun s here okay where was the sun in the afternoon anthony it was like barely okay okay semijah it was in the clouds okay it was sometimes it was going behind the clouds where was it alex where was it in the sky you don t remember behind the school okay behind the school so this was our morning experiment and this was our afternoon experiment okay and did we get different kinds of data because what was truly pretty much the same between both days besides the sun what was the air temperature in the morning 25 25 okay so our air temperature stayed the same but the thing that was different was what where the sun was where the sun was okay so thinking about that we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school okay a solar water heater installed at the school so what other do y all know a solar water heater a hot water heater in your house okay when you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water how do you think that water s heated does anyone know peyton you have the water in your well you have a water heater in your garage or um okay it s in your garage but what s heating that water the sun no,0.0
boys and girls for the last week we have been looking at videos about dr martin luther king we ve been reading books about dr martin luther king to get a feel for who he was why people loved him so much why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did so today we are going to watch another clip of dr martin luther king this is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave it was his i have a dream speech i don t want you to so much listen to his words today as i want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he s speaking that makes him such a great speaker how does he capture his audience how does he get people to want to listen to him alright so i want you to pay close attention it s just a short clip then you ll turn to your partners so let s see let me go ahead and get this started i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers i have a dream today i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together this is our hope this is our hope and this is the faith that i go back to the south with with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope with this faith we will be able to okay i m going to stop it there and i want you to tell me first of all what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience i want you to think about it for a minute i see lots of hands up what i want you to do is turn to your share partner first talk to your partner about what you saw okay let me have your attention back up here i m going to write dr king in the middle of this web what i want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what dr king had to say sara he had hand motions he had hand motions but there was no hand motions in that clip yeah there was i m glad that you all saw that i almost said something you could kind of see this hand go up but it was so close the video was so close that s why i picked that particular segment because i saw his arm and i thought oh i hope they get that because i couldn t find a better clip zachary the way he said a few words at a time okay he said words at a time and stopped very good he spaced his words for lack of something a better term to use zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on annie okay emma he spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him okay so his tone of voice right we ll put tone of voice so it was easy to hear him yeah and then he didn t mumble he spoke up really loud he spoke loudly he did not mumble she said he spoke loudly he spoke very serious yes he spoke very serious jesenya he shook his head he shook his head didn t he he nodded very good that was my idea he shook his head or nodded dalen he was looking at the audience very good he was looking at the audience we call that eye contact he had notes in front of him but he didn t do this did he no he looked up constantly he might have looked down to see where he was in his speech but he always looked back at his audience lenare he said nice words that the people knew okay the words that he spoke he had a good message didn t he if you have a good message people are willing to listen to you too he was a good good man one more kalen he even had a gooder life a better life very good and that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke the good message about having a better life all right so you guys came up with some really good points right here what i want you to think about when you do your readers theater i want you to think about how you can incorporate what dr martin luther king incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you re believable in your part that people can understand what you re saying so what we re going to do is we re going to create a rubric together that s going to help you so it s called rubric for speaking out for justice dr martin luther king jr a readers theater play grade two because you guys are second graders now let s take a look at what i ve written listening speaking viewing there s a three a two and a one let s do listening first okay now if three is the highest how do you think you can get a three sayid by getting a one plus two okay but don t think about math right this moment oh i want you to think about if i were grading you you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three emma we start with listening you wouldn t be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around you d be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is you have to be ready very good you have to know where your part is part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it s your turn to speak okay so i was a good listener let s look at number two how do you think you would get a two how would you score a two for listening if the best is that you were a good listener what would two be annie looking at your paper and then like doing something else looking at your paper but doing something else maybe looking away maybe fidgeting so maybe you tried to listen most of the time but you had difficulty with it so we could say i tried to listen most of the time most of the time so what about a one kennedy i didn t listen at all very good like purposefully not paying attention i forgot to listen yeah you don t decide to do that on purpose whitney now the next thing you re going to be scored on is speaking so how could you get a three for speaking sara don t speak like just normal like how the actor would speak speak how the actor would speak good lenore let s do a body check please i need you all on the carpet you re supposed to like listen to what he said okay annie like speak a little louder when you speak loudly then i spoke loudly enough for people to hear i have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream that one day the state of alabama will will be will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers my dad and i have that dream too when we let freedom ring we will let it rumble we will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city we will be able to see that day when all of god s children black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old negro spirit free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at last dad when i listen to reverend king i know that he s right i know that things are going to change i think you re right act iv it is now spring of 1963 the speech of reverend king has continued to lead people and speak out their he has met with another president lyndon b johnson and has seen changes sweep across the country may billy please come in here i have some news what is it mom reverend king is dead he was shot in memphis tennessee no mom that s not fair he was helping all of us i agree billy it isn t fair but remember reverend king lives on in us every time we remember the words every time we speak out against things that are unfair we are giving remembrance okay so go find the people that had your card and have your conversations get your feedback about how you did miss walters i got all three too great great did you see me i had nine points you were a good listener very good great feedback,0.0
starter stopper opposite side okay everybody has their marbles how many trials are we doing five five trials if the first one doesn t work raise your hand i will come help you and we ll talk about why it doesn t work and what we re gonna do to change it what you re gonna do to change it okay timers get your people ready remember you re gonna say ready set as soon as that go all right go ready set go oh you re supposed to get it right here this great piling direction did y all s work yeah good good did you record the time look tell him you guys are ready to keep going five trials good job and we ll discuss why yours worked in a minute we gonna take okay hang on tell me what happened when it got here it stopped it stopped why did friction okay the probably because the speed wasn t great enough okay so you think you needed more speed no i think we need to take this off okay let s try taking that off where do you think you can put those to get more speed up here ok now what is that gonna give the marbles more momentum yes let s make it bigger three centimeters is this our second one are we gonna do a second try you re going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works so reset it okay try again did it work yeah let s discuss why did it work this time look how we gave them these by doing what by um making it higher elevation ooh and what s another word that altitude yeah that s good okay so it worked how long did it take seven seconds face the recorder got it okay very good keep going you re ready for your second trial okay we re done y all already done five trials okay well let s just stop for a minute what comes down let s pull together here let s talk i want you guys to talk about why you think it worked because the big hill helped the hill what force is that the hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum good job so gravity pulled it down what did you say i said the hill s bigger than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go to make it through the loop right and the force pulling it down was what gravity gravity good now talk to me about the order that you put it in why would you you kind of just did we put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop to get more speed behind it good and the turn would make it slow down yeah so what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end friction friction okay very good we got all five trials you guys need a knee start recording your information it went really fast really fast just three seconds did it work on the first trial no okay tell me what happened on the first trial it was like that and it just went off right here okay why do you think it fell off what was going on right here to make it fall twist there was a twist in it so you just had to fix it so that it went straighter and so you pushed it renny put it like this like around here pushed it in so it might have been a little to steep too that incline might have been too steep what order did you put your elements in hill loop and turn okay and why d you put the hill first because it s higher and it would give more speed what force is giving it more speed right here gravity very good okay and then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn why didn t you put your turn there if we turn there s not enough speed for the loop okay y all both said the exact same thing repeat that to me so i understand if we put the turn first it won t have enough speed for the loop good very good all right good job guys have you got five trials it s all three seconds all of em were the same that s interesting very good we ll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information anthony what was your job record so you were the one that found that they were the same each time make sure you get written down everything okay guys talk to me we got three did the first one work no tell me what happened on the first one becuase i didn t see it the first one we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down right here when the chair was right there it kept on falling off so it just dropped so you think the incline was too what straight it was too steep there you go that s the word i m looking for it was too steep because it was right here and it was going all down very good so what did you do to fix it we kept on sliding it down a little did you have to slide it down more than once yes good job guys so did you get it to where you could do five trials yes and we got three for each three seconds they did too they got the exact same for all of em how about that but look at your coasters they look different yeah that s interesting too cause their incline is steeper than yours lets talk about the order that you have your elements in what s first the hill because it gives more speed when it s going down a hill so you don t but that s on what force gravity good job and why d you put your loop right after that because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it because if we did the turn it wouldn t have enough speed to make the loop good job good job need a knee record your information and start figuring your speed have you guys got all five trials nope uh oh what happened it stopped because of the friction when it get right here it started getting out of friction friction right here what s causing friction right here can i watch it its gonna work this time because we taped it down why do you think it s gonna work because we taped it down you know what i want you to use that one how long did that take seven seven seconds all right do it again let s look at it again so it was stopping right here it always was stopping right there and then i taped it down oh you taped this down that thing could be higher okay i think you should try that we can use this clock no we need some more i was gonna get one of them books guys you can use any state so what are you doing to the hills making it bigger so the speed will go more faster more faster so that it ll increase the speed all right let s see what happens let s see if this one works angel what are you doing timing ready one oh we use good team work you are using good teamwork i m proud of it ready set go it didn t start from the beginning i did not start that one let me ask you this just to give you a different idea because you ve already tried to change in the elevation of your hill maybe how big the loop is how do you think that ll help so the will go faster and will make it go through all right we re gonna try this help her out guys so we re making the loop smaller and that s gonna so now you might want to move this up a little bit there you see how this is gonna have to go there you go what about your taping if it s will the yeah let s try again wait we were gonna time that honey now you re ready to go so what was the solution to your problem to make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster all right good job now you re ready to time five trials ready go look how beautiful good job guys how many seconds four four seconds that s good how many trials three we got two more i want to know you got three seconds on each one so your speed was the same where did your distance come from we did how many feet and then we found out how many inches and times it by 18 because it s 18 on there how long was each tube six feet six feet how many inches is that let s work it out make sure you ve got it right on here 72 so you ve got 72 inches we only did one tube and how many tubes are there there s three tubes so 72 what would you do next times three yes 72 times three how did you guys get 216 you did 18 inches instead of six i mean 12 okay so now you ll have to go back and redo your speed figure in your speed so how do you find speed i still got 216 well then you were right that s right so you guys are ready to go on to make a graph let s talk about the graph you re gonna make let s talk about the graph thinking about what you ve learned in math and what you ve been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here what is this right here time i want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs i want you to decide what kind of graph you should make line graph because it s over time yeah line graph i decided yeah we decided to put a line graph because it s time so any time you use time the line graph is the one to use very very good do we write the numbers on here yeah how are you gonna know what numbers to put on there think about it you ve got the trials the distance the time and the speed do you need to use these you re probably just gonna use your trial and your speed so you ll label your line graph one will be the trial and one will be the speed and do you remember when you did the race car activity not the race car activity i m sorry remember the stanley the sluggish snail what did that line graph look like it was a straight line because it was a constant speed so what do you think this is gonna look like constant speed a straight line good okay you ve got your trial you got your times let s talk about your speed first we need to look at your distance how did you figure distance we need to divide by those speeds but your distance is how far the marble traveled right 18 yeah 18 yeah because you said each was six feet six feet you re doing it in inches oh so let s go back and refigure that i want you guys to talk about how to do that cause we want it in inches so what is the first thing you would do y all talk through it y all talk to each other let s talk about it after you re done erasing i was thinking like how many inches each okay there you go talk about it anybody know how many inches are in a foot 16 nope try again if you have a ruler 12 yep good so that s 12 x 3 good 36 okay so 36 inches and then how many of these are there three uh huh 36 multiplied six speed so you need to do 6 x 12 6 x 12 is 72 make sure you got it right i did it before it is 72 so now you will do 72 times three good do it on your paper it s 216 inches okay now what are you gonna do write it down and then what multiply 216 to this so how will you figure speed now divide divide what three to 216 very good can you tell me that again jeffrey you re gonna do what divide 216 into three and you ll only have to do it how many times one because you got the same speed each time you can do three into 216 72 and no remainder that s nice isn t it now knowing what we know about graphs what we re doing in math jeffrey are you listening y all stop writing for a minute and listen knowing what we know about graphs what we talked about in math and using this data and speed what kind of graph do you think you re gonna make line why did you say a line graph because it s the same i want you to think about this right here over time we discussed we need to use a line graph okay when you make your line graph which two columns there s only two columns that you can use on there which two do you think you re gonna use this one and well you ve already figured that out this one and which other one and speed good right because you were figuring all this for speed what do you think your line s gonna look like straight straight because it was the same every time good,0.0
i see lots of different levels of tennis i see some balancing levels blake why do you choose to balance this who wants to share keeping that ball controlled back to back catching placement find a partner and standing with equipment on the ground i ve got two groups ready equipment s on the ground you re looking for somebody you may have not worked with already you should have found a partner if not you guys will start thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground lost and found lost and found always come to the start very good when i say go you re going to turn to your partner i want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity what i have on the board over here and i also have it on my screen lifetime activity what does it mean to have a lifetime activity what does the word lifetime mean go bryan soccer baseball maybe not soccer maybe one of those yeah maybe it could be yeah soccer volleyball yeah volleyball and five four three two and one my partner and i zachary had some really good examples of what lifetime means so i m gonna use his zachary said that lifetime means you do it now as a third grader but we could do it later in life as an adult raise your hand if that s what you and your partner kinda said it s something you should be able to do later in life very good and then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life zachary said two cool ones tennis anybody else say tennis awesome pat yourself on the back and he also said bowling and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader and later in life is that they re pretty good on your body you can still do em they re not gonna injure your body too much it s gonna make you strong and healthy we have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out we ve talked about aerobic capacity and tennis will make your heart beat faster you have to find something that s gonna make the heart beat faster so now turn to your partner talk about what you re gonna choose to make your heart beat faster go and five four three two one pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity that you re gonna choose nice job when i say go you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face off position so this is where my partner and i came and we put our equipment down then we ll turn and look at the board ready go looking for an open spot with a partner thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly now we re transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges so far we ve worked by ourselves to be responsible learners brian are you looking for your partner he s right here so now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners on the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday zachary and ms rock will show you an example of what you could practice we re gonna actually skip this level today but you could choose it if you said hey you know what let s go back to this other level so zachary and ms rock both have our rackets we re gonna practice underhand striking keep up raise your hand if you remember that awesome alright here it is i tick step tock and he s gonna strike back or he can catch it and then i m gonna keep striking we re gonna keep our paddles low go ahead alright i m gonna wait til it gets low so i can strike he s gonna also wait til it gets low to strike keeping that paddle low we re trying to keep it up as long as we can awesome so that was the first level striking keep up with the balloon now we re gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner super duper cool it looks like this only one person will need a bean bag since i m closest to the wall i m the person to have the bean bag first i m going to be the underhand thrower zachary go ahead and pick up your racket create a flat surface i m going to underhand throw he s going to catch it on his racket take a step tock good try you might have to reach out and get under it now he s gonna leave it on his racket and he s gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands go ahead take a step tock i catch alright he needs to have three tries with the racket then it s my turn to have three tries with the racket thumbs up if you understand down if you got a question alright person closest to the wall you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag bring it back and place it in your racket go quickly quickly and five four three two one you should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket raise your hand if you have a question so partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up you re the tosser first with your hands you only need the beanbag you only have the beanbag grab your place on your side thank you christopher for being safe we re gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly we re gonna see how far we get we re gonna be responsible if the beanbag is not working so well you can go back to a balloon balloon alright let s practice go one catching on their racket one catching on their hand i hear good communication with a partner you have to help each other one person is underhand throwing one person is catching awesome if you haven t switched jobs go ahead and switch jobs at this time if you haven t switched jobs see how many good catches you can get give yourself a point for each catch hands or racket are you using the opposite foot to step back with both partners pick up rackets both partners pick up rackets look at the board now you re gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge count how many you can get go there you go zach excellent one and freeze alright from here i m going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners we have learned to use a bean bag with a partner we re gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball and a large tennis trainer both of these offer different challenges the first one is a foam ball as you can see on the screen they now have a foam ball zachary picks up his racket we are doing an underhand strike back and forth but like we did with the tennis ball we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to so zachary do you think if i tossed this to you you could try catching it alright let s see nice he had to figure out how to keep that balance on here he s gonna do the same thing back to me this is just working on looking for that ball getting our feet to it and keeping a flat surface we can do the catching with the ball now we re ready for the tap offs remember what we did with the balloon we re gonna try to keep the foam ball up this is what it looks like tap tap good try it went away a little bit stop it we come back i tick step tock good we re keeping a flat surface coming back slanted out the lower the racket the better control we will have i want the racket to stay at a slant to partner can you say that slant to partner so that s the foam ball challenge some of you may just stay with the foam ball but if you re like i wanna challenge myself and my partner i say zachary we can now use the tennis trainer and it s going to bounce strike bounce strike the bouncing is gonna bounce here before i hit it then it will bounce in the middle then my partner will strike okay ready zachary so it s a bounce strike bounce strike excellent and i would come back and start it over again if i need to bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike catch when needed were we controlled yeah when it got out of control we caught it so from here on out you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with bean bag what came next foam ball and then tennis trainer excellent see how far you get with the partner you re working with this uses communication and cooperation say that communication and cooperation excellent this is how it would look zachary what piece of equipment would you like for us to use or you think you re ready the the foam ball or the balloon what did you say the end one the end he said he wanted to use the tennis trainer w for wilson it s the brand i said oh you know what zachary i don t feel like i m ready for this one can we go back to a foam ball first and he said yes i m all phew thank you we just had communication and cooperation i know that i can practice with this one for a little longer i ll probably be ready for the challenge alright ready go are you able to keep your paddles low keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled are you using an underhand strike alright ready zachary bounce strike bounce strike let it bounce one time bounce strike bounce strike good bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike now i m going to give you a challenge so i can go around the room and see if anyone needs help you ll just work on tap ups you can use any equipment that you need okay tap ups or tap downs if you and your partner need a little help you can always raise your hand and i can come over try to review those cues with you underhand strike okay bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike okay say that bounce strike okay and if it s not working then you and your partner need to say we need to go back to the be responsible try it again though bounce strike bounce strike ooh this is where aiyah did she step with her opposite foot did you step when you strike no so it s key to step when you strike you gotta step try it again keeping those paddles low if you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot that s a reflection you should say ooh we a need help or b let s go to a different level responsible word i hear which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with and freeze equipment should be back on our rackets now i see students at all different levels so that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class which is excellent but now we re gonna see if you can switch it up a bit and give yourself a challenge you should be able to work with anybody so what i m gonna have you do is let s see here ellie ellie is gonna step over here come jogging down all the way down to where zachary is yay ellie ellie is gonna slide down one and that s gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner where you going very good zachary and then you go one down yep there you go now wave to your new partner excellent same thing here harrison come on down and slide on down wave to your new partner now you all of a sudden have to have more communication because you don t know where this partner is at ready go talk which one are you gonna do,0.0
just take it in but take your tube off first before you pull it out before you pull the needle out take your vacutainer tube off and this is pull it out again yeah use your two by two remember oh yeah there you go good job faye and guys it just takes a while this is not something you re going to learn overnight this is a skill that it takes a little while to learn you ve got to get hand movements down you ve got to figure out what works best for you you know if you need things placed in a different position but after this you all can start sticking the arms when you re not doing your book work then whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down you feel like you re proficient then i ll watch you which i ll watch you doing then you all will stick me so what do you think cassie hmm what do you think is it easier than you thought or harder than you thought easier yay faye those arms are a little harder to get those veins are not as easy to feel as that s okay she s doing a fine job two by two sorry you to draw blood from them pop your tourniquet engage your safety good job from down there yeah they say not to use these and you can use hand veins but remember first choice second choice last choice and then hand veins if you re going to do hand veins you all have been through a lot of the book work already if you re going to use hand veins what kind of needle are you going to use butterfly butterfly okay i know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic you guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab we ll do it at dr maderis clinic so that you all can get more sticks there is there some people who draw only from around here not usually now there are some people they ll come in and they ll say you can t get blood from anywhere from me except here what that one lady told you is right here right i m better at popping it out remember i couldn t get it in good it will be something that after you get these hand movements down it ll just happen because when i m not talking while i m doing it i mean it just flows because i have done it for several years but for some reason after you get older it s hard to talk and do something at the same time that s what we re going to do today is you all are going to learn how to draw blood you re going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they re called and each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you re ready to start drawing blood and i know that wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because guys when you get out there in the clinical area a lot of people don t follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws guys that are medical assisting you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor s office when you re there in the doctor s office it s just you and the person so you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don t get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn the first things i want to talk about is your vein choice and i printed off your veins and the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle you can see this one better yeah you see that one better your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from that s the one that runs little finger side and then your cephalic is on the thumb side so this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from and the reason that this is your last choice vein is there s quite a few nerves that are right underneath it so if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage and i will leave this on the table as y all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you re choosing your vein you can only advance or withdraw the needle only you cannot go sideways i know those of you who s already been in the clinical site you ve seen them go sideways you ve seen them come out and go back in and guys that could be a liability for you and you re the only one that can protect your patient and you i ve got the materials set up whenever we repeat this you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we ve got here because you ll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms when you go to clean your arm you re going to clean in a circular motion so i m going to go ahead and get started first thing you re going to do i don t need your gloves just the two hands first thing you re going to do is put on your gloves i just washed my hands but i m going to put on my gloves and why do i want to do that jim so i don t get infected yeah i don t want to come into contact with someone s blood now who could protect me from coming into contact with someone s blood yourself i m the only one that can do that and i can tell you from having my blood drawn people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn t know me from adam and one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them so i am the only one that can protect me if i see you practicing without your gloves on it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day if i see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on then we re going to have a big talk okay because you ve got to protect you i have a question with some people that you draw blood on do you have to wear a mask like an eyeshield type thing if they are on precautions then yes you would and you ve seen at the hospital on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation if you were to go into one of those rooms yes you would in the er when you draw blood you usually have on that splash mask now usually with a venipuncture you re not going to have that much pressure it s not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would but still it s better to err on the side of safety but also if there s nothing wrong with me except i need a cbc to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield i m going to think oh my gosh why is she doing that you know so make sure that it s appropriate if you re in a trauma area then yes definitely if you re in an outpatient clinic unless that patient tells you my veins squirt blood really bad a patient will tell you one time i was doing a finger stick and it squirted and i had on my glasses but i turned my head it hit me in the hair so sometimes the venous flow will do that good question cathy all right so got my gloves on first i m going to do is i m going to put the tourniquet on and guys the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it and you re going to put it underneath the arm you need to make sure it s tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you re going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you re going to cause petechiae which is little red patches on the arm i m going to cross my hands over what i do is i put my left hand in position i take my right hand get ahold of the tail of this pull it and then i stick it underneath with my little finger you always want your tails up toward the top so they re not in your area where you re going to clean and draw when i m going to clean well let me show you how to feel first well it s not going to cooperate today you can use my arm that way they can see better can you move the sharps container i m going to stick it underneath there and now it should stay on there now to locate a vein i m going to take my index finger and i m going to feel back and forth and guys you all can do this on each other jim s excellent to feel veins on and he s a real good volunteer bounce back and forth it feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there if it feels really hard like i have one that i ll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard you re not going to get blood out of it it s got to be it s got to bounce so when you go across and you find it then you re going to find which way it travels so you re going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight so i found my vein now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute has my tourniquet been on about a minute probably so so i need to take the tourniquet off give this patient s arm a rest and then i can talk to them about the weather i can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time and then i m ready to draw blood now so i come in here i put my tourniquet on and guys when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute and i m going to clean i m going to clean in a circular motion and then if you re having trouble with the alcohol you re not able to fan it you can t blow on it and you can take one very clean 2 by 2 go straight down dry it off and then many of you already did that this part of the needle this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it you screw that in take the end off this is a safety needle you anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle that is the pointy part the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin i pull my thumb away as i m going in i take one of these vacutainer tubes thank you jim and i push it in and guys when i push in with my thumb i m pulling back with my fingers and you re not able to see but there is and i don t do this in the clinical side but there is blood coming in there you let it fill until it stops now it s stopped flowing i m going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle the less it s going to hurt the patient pop my tourniquet and i m going to take a different 2 by 2 than what i cleaned with fold it lay it on the arm and guys i m just going to kind of hover there until i bring the needle out and push down if i push down while the needle is in the arm it hurts really bad and i m going to hold here and i m going to hold until it quits bleeding and you can peek now if the blood oh sticky needle engaged it s hard to talk and do stuff at the same time isn t it sharps and you toss that in the sharps now if this patient is on blood thinners i ve got to hold longer a lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there put a coband on them and send them on their way if they bleed out outside of the lab you re liable and again you re the only one that can protect you so i make sure that they ve stopped bleeding and now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full you guys have been observing can we ask them to hold it well you can but what if they don t hold it tight enough what if there s a whole lobby full jim what have you seen them do in the past and check yeah you need to check it if there s a whole lobby full sitting out there then you ll get to them when you get to them because you ve got to protect your phlebotomy certificate you re the only that can do that a lot of places they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there tell the patient to hold their arm up that breaks platelets that s going to make a huge bruise and it doesn t really help with the clotting that much just kind of bruises so we re going to look here okay this patient has quit bleeding so i am good to go here now another lesson i will teach you about writing on the vials the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there so before you all draw let me ask you a few questions what s your first choice vein median median okay and why do we avoid the basilic nicole nerves and tendons nerves okay what can happen if i powder on the shirt what can happen if i dig around in there and i do injure somebody what can they do they can bleed or they can have their nerve damage right and they can come and say this phlebotomist drew here and then guys if you re ever in a setting where you have to go to court they re going to call somebody that s a phlebotomist like you are and they re going to ask them what s your first choice vein and they re going to say the median and they re going to say what s your next choice what s your last choice so you re going to have somebody there that knows you really don t want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice okay what can happen if the patient s on blood thinners cassie what s the most important thing to remember about the patient that s on blood thinners to keep pressure to keep pressure okay how do you clean your site martika in a circular outward motion circular you don t ever go back over and how long do you leave the tourniquet on faye one minute one minute good job okay you all get your first thing you do is what gloves get your gloves on so you all are going to draw with drawing blood are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to i would if i were you because that just protects you so you can write median you can write an mc median cubital and that way you may actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw and that way they know that you drew from the median that you didn t draw from basilic i need another needle okay anybody else need another needle thank you you re welcome i m going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody feel their veins feel all the different types of veins some people have garden hoses is what i call them some people have very large veins and feel for your vein the tourniquet pinched my thumb the gloves are hard to you trading them out it s this arm jim i think because i had trouble getting it when i was doing it too okay just make it a little tighter with your oh did you stick yourself mm mm okay i screwed the wrong part i think she s bleeding and i haven t even done anything yet oh yeah hand me another one there it goes again okay casey let me see what i can do for you good job martika want to just chill how s the weather blah blah blah blah is it not come undone now you might want to pull your tail just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails it ll stay down okay it s moving again you re kidding see okay just keep going okay just keep going it s easier on a person that s my stomach jim it s hungry sorry yeah this one jim knows which ones stay better okay you got to anchor your vein with your non dominant with your non dominant hand you anchor your vein i have to stand i can t see you take your thumb and you pull down here anchor your vein there you go casey are you left handed too mm mm i thought you said non dominant hand non dominant hand to anchor back it out put it in this hand are you right handed mm hmm put non dominant hand thumb there anchor okay now did you clean it yep okay then go in uh oh it s okay it s okay well that s okay put that on start over a lot of this is hand movement a lot of this is prac,0.0
all right we ve been talking about listening and viewing i have our chart to help us out and i wanna see if you can tell me what effective and respectful listening and viewing looks like matthew um looking looking okay so our eyes need to be watching watching christopher hands oh what do our hands need to be doing still they need to be still matthew pelkey mouth shut our mouth shut our lips are

can see the wind blow down down the tree show your work nice oh thumbs up signs he spoke very slowly,0.0
so you can t count it out completely hmm so we have three things going on here i hear exponential decay i hear an upside down parabola and i hear a negative sloping line red why don t you chime in i haven t heard from you are you going with decay are you going with decreasing line you going with upside down parabola what had you guys decided we were going to go with decay but you were going to go with decay okay but i changed my mind because decay it keeps decreasing all the way but myspace it got to a point where it stopped decreasing and it was like what rosetta said so it stopped decreasing which is what you re saying and you re saying that s in agreement with rosetta i have a serious issue with a line stopping can somebody talk to me about that i have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself it s the end of the line slows itself colin i haven t heard from you i don t think it s linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on myspace i agree with elsie that it might be decay because it decreased but decay doesn t ever touch the x axis which would signify there are no users ah and there will always be users oooh what s somebody thing about that really really really significant comment that was just made by colin what do we think the fact that it s never going to how did you say it i said that the linear was going to at one point to hit zero and with decay it s never going to hit zero it s going to get really close but not touch it jeffrey i agree with colin because if it was a negative line like a negative line right you re going to go past zero and you can t have a negative amount of users cause a line keeps on going forever ok does exponential keep going forever no i mean yes yes it does but because it s so small that it never touches the x axis but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero so if we all agree are we getting closer to agreeing that it s exponential decay yes if we are agreeing it s exponential decay then what jeffrey just said what does that mean for myspace the company will it go out of business no based on what jeffrey just said about an exponential decay at the end what does that mean for myspace the company what do you know about myspace the company at this moment it s still low it s still low but is it in existence yes it is do you know what s keeping it you know i think because you re always going to have that one user account ok you might you might always have that one user there s something though that myspace provides that other websites don t that s very easy to do that other sites don t have and this is what s keeping it from touching that x axis do you know what it is alicia talk to us i can t hear you music yes alicia who is in the band would obviously know this right tell them what you do on myspace alicia bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them yeah you can upload your music on myspace easier than any of the other sites very good thank you for chiming in alright let s shift gears from myspace now let s talk twitter twitter twitter twitter what do you think about the growth of twitter alright keywords red start me off with keywords and then we ll bounce to pink and around the room give them your attention ladies and gentlemen are you guys prepared and ready for twitter rush i m sorry rush where show me it s missing something there what s your keyword rush it s in the middle of the sentence in the third sentence oh rush is that what you said ok just speak up i m getting old i can t hear growth continues steadily okay anything else yeah but it s at the tweets this the tweeted yeah it goes with this okay so what do you guys pick for the growth what function models twitter s growth exponential growth you think it s exponential growth as well alright is there a team pink you re up i disagree with that i think it s linear because it says that another keyword that they ve given is with 40 million in may that whole sentence right there got it that s like a slope if you think about it with 40 million in may 2009 6 months later 60 million and then 80 million in may 2010 the slope it would be 20 million so it s linear it s going positive slope hmm filling out those listening labs pink just gave some hard core evidence red do you have a comeback or have they won you over you have a comeback let s hear it lenny what s your comeback this can not be because because it s going to get to a point where it s going to stop it s not like we re going to take it like do you have a time machine ok so let s leave lenny i think exponential growth isn t going to stop and i think a line isn t going to stop right and i think that if we think about the future i think that s what star is maybe trying to do is predict the future we don t really know but from the language here in your text the information you do know i think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope do you agree yes yes anybody else want to chime in on this one that i haven t heard from maybe from elianna on blue bleaker i haven t heard from you carlia yet what do you guys think how bout anything you want to add about twitter anything you want to add greg go ahead well what lenny was saying i cannot beat and i agree with them that s it ok thank you any i agree with star because as you mentioned what this does or hope is that they ll be able to tweet via text messages and that s something that facebook didn t offer so the more things that the more things that twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase ok so as twitter grows you re saying the other networks might be slowed who though is going to outperform it if it s a different type of graph who is going to outperform twitter for sure if twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned facebook right because facebook is what exponential exponential very good ok so let s go now to aim we re doing very well on time here aim who s going to start us off with aim alright pink you can start us off keywords and reasoning talk to me some key words we worked was aol lost their dominance lost their dominance okay yep and then we put continuous fielding is growth today okay and we said that it was quadratic equations because at one point it was really high but then as time went by it started decreasing but then it started getting more popular again lately teenagers liked using it so it started going up again ok is there another keyword up here that would help anybody i think there s at least one more keyword that i haven t seen pointed up elianna is it comeback comeback where s comeback beautiful made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier jermaine thank you sorry say that again dominated dominated very nice jermaine so it started out dominating then had to make a comeback does anybody want to add on to what pink said about this being quadratic which way which way would make it positive from earlier positive what talk to me about the equation now quadratic is always going to do quadratics always go up no go down too parabolic this parabola they always look like this no think about inverses we learned through this year raise your hand and let me know what you want to say talk to me do parabolas always open upwards go ahead i just want to agree with them you agree that it s a parabola yeah because in a parabola it says that it started off dominating but you re on top if you re dominating then it said that it made a comeback that means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back they come back up beautiful wanna add to that go ahead i was just going to say the other end alright so i just want to make sure i answered purple s question in the back you asked which way take a look at this this is what you re talking about could the parabola be like this what would this mean if the parabola were down for the company if it was down then that means it s imaginary right you re thinking of something about imaginary and it s not if it s down that has to do with a negative right if there s a negative a coefficient something else though what would this mean for the company s trend deshawn go ahead deshawn they would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up and come back down purple are you alright with that now you understand this would not have worked based on what deshawn just said here s my question for you on aol why isn t aol an absolute value graph what starts high comes down and goes back up we did do absolute value functions right turn and talk first and then you re going to tell me write that question down somewhere i want to know why it s not an absolute value graph oh yeah we did talk about these today if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you re getting ten members then every five minutes you re gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible ok guys bring it back i want to know why isn t why didn t anybody say absolute value i m going to maybe put one over here and then i have one more really important question about these graphs for you and then we re in good shape absolute value the reason i asked that is because that also starts high comes down low and goes back up i need some reasoning let s change it around start with gold and go around go i don t think it s an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend because in the absolute value it s y is equal to absolute value of x meaning that as time passed they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people so like if you gained ten members every five minutes every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what every five minutes or when it goes down every five minutes you d be losing ten members whereas a parabola that changes is not constant you can lose and gain power then they d be equal to join or don t join and you can t guarantee that you re going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed so would it be fair to say it s too con,0.0
does everyone agree on the first question yeah what did you all agree on that it wasn t really fair for for first and second class to go through without any problems and the people from the steerage had to go through examinations and this whole long hassle and why was that why did people who were first and second class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations cause of the money what about the money because they thought that they had they were perfect they had no disease they had lots of money and thought they would work hard so the stereotype is what that rich people are more can work harder or have less chance of disease than the people in steerage do you think that that stereotype is still true today or do you think it s not true anymore it was just for first and second class passengers for steerage passengers before emigrating well it s kind of like this it s not over the top but it s just a little bit what do you guys think about what eric said i agree with him why it s not fair because first and second class usually are kings or royalty and so if you re in steerage you re just a normal person if you re in steerage it s not going to be fair you have to go walk through that and well first and second class passengers they weren t necessarily royalty they were just people who had a lot of money people who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive what do you guys think about what eric said that the stereotype today is still here but not really just kind of back and forth it s back and forth they don t do the same thing anymore who s they and what s the same thing the american embassy the people that take care of the immigrants and everything and all about them they don t go to ellis island anymore they don t go to ellis island anymore you have to go on a plane or you have to drive here but do you think the stereotype in general that rich people are better or they don t have diseases and they re just better than people who don t have a lot of money do you think we still have those stereotypes today sometimes sometimes have you seen it ever no no but you just think it s still there i haven t really seen it at all yeah i agree with okay you can start the next one hold on josh did you have something else to add yeah on tv shows sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes and they re usually pretty snotty and how do you know they re snotty they re always like don t touch that it s going to fall and you re going to pay for that oh okay so you do see in tv sometimes yeah all right do you think immigrants were treated fairly at ellis island why or why not i don t think they were treated very fairly because they had to go through i agree with jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at ellis island but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in america yeah and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay some of the doctors two people could have the same diseases but both the doctors one doctor could send one person home and one person could stay at ellis island which is unfair possibly because of their religion or the way their language i think they were mostly i think they were mostly yeah so they were mostly treated well but sometimes not sometimes not yeah the doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back and remember the book that we read it kind of said that the cousin he had to be sent back to well he almost had to be sent back to his country because to russia yeah to russia because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected his father was trying to tell him but they didn t listen yeah he didn t i think they should have translators with all of them so then it would make it fair that spoke english and that language that language so they can understand things so i would say mostly yeah mostly so should we check them both off i think we should check off the first one if they were sick or something or if they needed food they had places where they could get food or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital like sophia said so i m in the middle kind of because sometimes they were treated badly i agree with josh because if they were sick they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases like oh get away from me because you re going to spread that disease to everybody it s going to be an epidemic i want to add if they were sick they could have been contagious and there were a lot of people at ellis island so they might have usually if they were at a hospital they were curing curable diseases because if they couldn t cure it they didn t have a medicine or anything to cure that they got sent back yeah i agree with eric and sophia go ahead were you going to say something i was going to say if we all agree on this so your general feeling here is were they treated fairly at ellis island they weren t treated not very fairly like they were treated half the fair that they should have been but they weren t treated really good they were fed very well and all their needs were there but they weren t treated very good like if you were on an airplane in first class it s kind of like i would like to add they were treated way better in ellis island because on the ship in steerage they didn t have good food they couldn t really bathe and it was all crowded they didn t really have a good place to sleep but in ellis island they actually had okay food they weren t treated like do you think that it was fair that they each had to have 20 on them in order to stay yeah sort of sort of what i think is they need to take care of themselves and america is actually bringing lots of them over here america just could say stop no more immigrants at all but they ve been letting people in a lot of people in and they ve been very generous by giving them food and letting them live here in this wonderful country so they ve provided enough i have something i have two things to say i agree with sophia because i sort of agree with sophia because if they didn t have 20 they wouldn t have much to live and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants they re responsible for themselves they re on their own and i would like to say is that going back to sophia s it said that then they were fed well and that they were all wanted to get to america and even if some of them had money how do you know that they didn t have a disease or something how do you know if they didn t have lice or something i kind of agree with you because if they paid more i think they shouldn t get a lot a lot more but i think they should get a little bit more but they still should go to ellis island yeah sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships and kind of gave the medical exams to first and second class passengers to make sure they didn t have any diseases and then if their medical exams checked out fine then they could skip everything else so they didn t have to get asked all those questions and they didn t have to wait in all those long lines and things like that so what do you think about that i think it s still unfair that they didn t have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat i think instead of ellis island they should have checked them before they got on the boat for everyone yeah i agree with you i think they got all seasick think that s where they all got sick yeah like in the steerage some of them got sick because they were in steerage and then when they got to ellis island they had to get sent back the reason why some of them got sick was because they didn t have fresh air and so they couldn t breathe that well stuffy in steerage i think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don t like them for their religion and stuff could doctors send people back because they didn t like their religion doctors could send people back why doctors couldn t send people back but they would mark letters on your back why could they mark letters on your back because they probably thought they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch so just if you were hurt and then they had to go through further medical exams to see but doctors couldn t just say i don t like you you have to go back they were just examining you to make sure you didn t have a contagious disease that could get other people sick when we were reading they said something about the doctors where they didn t have any diseases or anything but they d still send them back and you read that in the book we were reading one of the things oh and why would they send them back why would they get sent back by the legal inspectors and other people sometimes it was like there were random reasons they sent them just because yeah that s not fair that s what you re saying yeah i d also change the part where they had to why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes yeah i mean they should have given a sheet or something or something because what if that s the only thing they had you know i think they should mark on their skin or something so then you could just wash it off like a marker or something no i don t think they should do it on the skin because then if there was a water fountain they could just wash it off and say i m in this line right true they could they could do that we all agree they should do something other than your own clothes they should give you a sheet of paper and you could rip it apart i think that they way they did it for example that guy in the book did his jacket inside out they should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them because someone could just say take this jacket inside out and then go into the other line or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow yeah oh i don t have a jacket yeah yeah if we didn t have ellis island not as many immigrants would be here probably because it d be a lot harder and ellis island they fed you food it was good i like it i agree with josh because they gave you food and water a place to sleep they built stuff and made kinder cares and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown ups the people that were there at ellis island didn t even have to pay for any of that that was all for free i mean imagine that happening to us right now that will never happen i definitely agree with sophia because if you just come to ellis island and they just give you potato soup every meal it s kind of like they don t get a good impression of america i think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on america from giving them good food and a good way to start their time in america and then they realize how complicated it is yeah according to everyone i kind of agree it was good i think,0.0
emotions is emotions that s so right kippa were you going to say something else in this picture he uses lots of texture to create like when he s doing the sunflowers he uses texture to show the light going on right and how did he show that texture did he how did he apply his paint sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick vincent would that you could almost feel it feel the texture and emotion like ozea said emotion was huge for vincent if he was happy he painted bright if he was sad he painted sort of dark how about our man pablo picasso what movement logan is he do you know the move cubism cubism and why do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism anybody besides mr logan anybody else know but thanks logan for raising what are you thinking what using geometric shapes to make things using geometric shapes that s right he was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see and flattening the shapes and flattening his color where van gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self portrait i wanna put up the work let s start with our man vincent again let s take a look at see where my hand oooh you can see all the wrinkles in my hand no way isn t that cool okay sorry don t mean to keep fooling around so let s talk about this let s talk about these two paintings guys what do you guys and let s see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something what do you see do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here anybody somebody besides kippa carina that it kinda has to deal with his emotion like where the boats are i feel like what i m feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff and then at the sunflowers he s really happy and bright and that was good carina okay elijah did you wanna was that about what you were gonna say you were gonna talk about the sadness what colors like do you think that if go ahead elijah he could ve been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark light red and all these other bright colors right and i remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer that s why i looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions wasn t that what you were saying yeah he was feeling both happy and sad cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too right that s good okay jose what did you wanna say he s sort of like there too but the boats might be out to sea like one s out to sea but one s not but torn i don t know how many are already but three are out in i don t know how many are out there s four that are here and then there look like four that are out i think that s the other okay but what were you going to say oh you re right three well what were you gonna say about them i m guessing three two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad but they could only take three because there s only enough for there s enough room for only three boats or three people but they only wanted their own boat two or three of them were but three didn t go because they didn t know what to do or anything but the other three did interesting that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw kind of yeah i like that i like that trevor what re you gonna say it s kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers they re mostly up but looks like they re starting to droop they re starting to die that is good i like that he might be like oh i m happy for a while but i m starting to feel back down nice did you wanna say something i would like to say one has different types of one looks more real those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the than the bottom more realistic than this picture he really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers i think does anybody know what were you gonna say elijah you can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there s bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it s orange and then at the very bottom it s dark green like right there yes that is very true that is very good the storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting wow kyle happiness is never lasting and what was the last one i m moved by that opinion go ahead and what was the so in the flowers the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die because happiness can be fleeting and we know oh does anybody know what was the political was there any political things going on the political mood or the setting where was vincent from did you guys find that in your research he stayed in france is that where he studied is that what you guys are telling me yeah that was sorta the hub of his movement we ll say any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that s up you can look on your research papers to see or anything go ahead emily i think that the actual emotions of these paintings don t really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in france so really i don t think they were much of a really affected him what were you going along with emily maybe he was just so dull that or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending so it depends maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then because he didn t have the happiest of all lives so he didn t we ve even talked about that do you guys remember when we talked about how vincent van gogh suffered a little bit mentally he was a little crazy crazy and in and out of mental institutions yeah so maybe something good happened cause his life was not very happy so most of his pictures are no not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull but you can tell when he s going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in like the boats you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad and then if you look at the sunflowers they re all bright and dreamy i mean yes this is a few dark bits but i think that s probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life guys this is really great i love all your comments logan i m gonna take one more and then i m gonna tell you something what go ahead logan i thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something and then he started painting it sad i have a question i think that you ve got something really important hon yeah so he never really stopped a painting in the middle when he started he finished he never stopped because if the light changed it would totally change the picture that s so true that is very true and you guys know that jose is it okay if i speak real quick and then we ll go back because we wanna talk about picasso too for a minute you guys know that vincent used to live with a painter this is my fun fact not really fun i guess but a fact about vincent he lived with a painter paul gauguin this was when he was in and out of mental institutions and they had a fight and he became so upset you guys know he cut off his ear and i showed you that one picture of him is a self portrait of him with his ear cut off you guys remember that and the other important thing i wanted to tell you was that he didn t sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after after he died they sold one of his paintings for 8 000 000 000 remember that it was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time okay now let s talk about and van gogh people if you guys wanna talk about picasso you can but let s give the picasso teams some time here this is and i m sorry the lighting is not the best but who knows what the name of this painting is marie is it three musicians three musicians and it was done by who pablo pablo picasso does anybody know where pablo picasso was from let s see someone other than mr logan travis barcelona barcelona where s barcelona you guys spain spain i got my barcelona jersey alright and who knows rudy do you happen to know and he s like uh oh i m on the spot ooo do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in pablo picasso in cubism cubism that s correct and we did go over what were the characteristics of cubism real fast anybody mr logan geometric shapes geometric shapes and what else they were flat what was flat his pictures but what element his painting the colors the colors were flat thank you okay let s have some opinion about what you see up here the three musicians does anybody have randy do you have any how do you feel about it honey what do you think about it i don t know it doesn t seem like it s in a down mood cause music is usually a happy sort of thing so it seems like a happy kinda picture kind of a happy fun picture pablo he wasn t so concerned about emotions when he painted he maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time does anybody know what was happening in spain at the time what are you thinking civil war there was a civil war so maybe he was a little bit affected by that he also traveled does anybody know where he traveled to rudy to go and study the art forms of paris he went to paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff so he went to study there and then where else he went to africa he went to africa and he really became obsessed with african masks and so he did start using that as an influence in his painting carina what were you gonna say darling oh i was thinking it s kind of like a mix of emotions cause it has so many colors there s bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper there s a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention it s attention grabbing isn t it cause of all the contrasting i think more in his is the contrasting colors you can see the blue and orange right next to each other those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright they totally stand off each other right the blue and the orange i can t remember what oh they re complementary colors i couldn t remember what that was right so that s why and i think his color contrast says a lot his flat colors and they re bright and he puts them right next to each other what do you think about this picture robert do you like it yeah do you know why you might like it or you don t like it i like the picture like yeah well you and maria are talking about doing remember you were talking about making your own picture you wanna tell us about that what you guys wanna do for your own picture and you re doing the style of pablo aren t you yeah so what do you think you guys are gonna do have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the three musicians on a porch you wanna have the three musicians be in a picture with you and your brother and maria are you gonna not on a porch on a deck that s what i was gonna say and you guys are gonna are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes the picture yeah try to good good do you guys have anybody oh what were you gonna say elijah it makes me think about it because there s so many twists and turns and curves and things kinda like if you look hard enough you can see em but when you just look at it you re like whoa right when you first look at it you re like whoa what is that are those people are those shapes there s lots of curves and turns at first it s a little confusing at first it is a little confusing isn t it when you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for em you can actually see what it is right if we didn t tell you it was the three musicians you might not know at first you can kinda tell because of that one right there that thing yeah the instrument here and the guitar and then the paper with the two the sheet music the sheet music you could kinda tell it was about the musicians what were you gonna say when you first look at the painting your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue s clarinet whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying at first when you just but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form it does start to form what were you gonna say emily i think that in my,0.0
at the end of class i want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further because the faster the bat goes the further the ball s gonna go and there s three things that we re going to do to make the bat swing faster okay we re going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer we re gonna hold the end to make it longer a longer bat means a faster bat we re gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we re gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing and we re learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy because there s lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles and we re gonna do four different things today i m gonna ask you to talk to a partner i m gonna do a little experiment we re gonna play spotlight tag and then we re gonna have some personal practice and i ve created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster i want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement go ahead hey everybody let me get your attention if i pull your stick i want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something we re green no we re red jeremiah where s jeremiah yes softball softball very good raquel where s raquel what raquel game or something you can play do we use a bat to play soccer no no how about stephanie baseball who said golf what about golf what about ping pong do you know what ping pong is yeah so all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat now we re gonna go around the blue house and you re gonna sit on the red dot until i say go and i m gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further i would like you to walk please be careful go okay thank you for sitting now over there i said the longer the bat the faster it goes the faster the bat the further the ball goes so i m gonna show you what i mean is this a very long bat no no so i m gonna swing and see how far it goes did it go very far no now i m gonna make that longer who thinks it s gonna go further let s see if it goes further it went a little bit further huh yes now by holding the bat at the end it ll make it longer and it ll go further now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles so i m only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat you think this will this go very far yeah yeah okay let s see no i didn t use a lot of muscle now i m gonna use lots of muscles on this step and i m gonna twist see how far it goes do it again do a lot of muscle anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster hit from the bottom i had it written over there does anyone else remember i want to make my bat longer i want to use lots of muscles and alex that s how we use lots of muscles i want to swing the bat for as long as i can in order to generate speed now if i start my bat right here and i swing it do i have lots of time to hit the ball no do you think it ll go far let s see what happens now if i start way back here do you think i ll have more time yeah you think it ll go further yeah all right let s see so raise your hand if you want to hit the ball far hitting the ball far will help you be successful and if you re successful you re going to have a good time but today we re going to learn different ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast don t swing please tell me it makes the bat go faster why does the bat go faster the bat goes faster the ball goes faster but what makes the bat go faster because it s short or long long longer bat means faster okay rotate rotate dominant hand on top step twist we re practicing what grip is the best how d that one go fernanda what grip are you using mr holden can i go to the bathroom hurry excellent twisting derek excellent twisting what number are you going to read it try this one hold your bat with your hands apart put your left hand on top i mean your right hand on the top left hand at the bottom spread your hands apart like this now try it again how did that go is that one good you think so now hold it at the end see what happens it s right here now hold your hands put your right hand on the top right hand on the top your right hand on top all right fernanda big step let s see it big step twist your whole body get your bat back there you go try it again did the ball go further that time okay sit behind your little cone and answer the question on your card alright now read it out loud for me which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest holding it at the end remember when we talked about how long the bat is a longer bat can travel faster or slower faster so when you hold it at the end it makes it longer and then you can swing it faster and then the ball goes further is that what happened yeah all right rotate alright are you going to twist or not twist back foot step put your weight on your front foot alright so pretend your feet are stuck in mud so you can t move them so we ve been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far because when we hit the ball far our game and when we re batting is more enjoyable we ve practiced we ve talked about and we ve discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further when we re batting okay i have a sentence frame for you it says i can blank to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further okay you re in your batting team groups right now when i say go i want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further and then i m gonna pull our sticks and you ll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster so now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers are there any questions no okay i m gonna give you about two minutes use the sentence frame discuss with your group go ahead alright how is your group doing jesse you getting to share i might pick your stick talk with alex what are we coming up with jeremiah how are we gonna make the bat go faster do you remember okay how about alex why do we twist alex alex why do we twist alex sit up please when we twist we use more what muscles what color were we black or green red oh we were red okay second grade eyes on me please sit down on a number you ve had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster if i pick your name please stand up speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster let s see here jonathan all right jonathan stand up buddy jonathan use the sentence frame i can i can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further good answer give him a round of applause when we have a longer bat it generates more speed and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster,0.0
are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90 no so you won t have any complementary to worry about is that supplementary though you will have supplementary right you re not gonna have to worry about the outside you re just gonna look at your inside when you measure your angles you ll be able to see supplementary yeah then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why we re supposed to draw a line well i want you to see what s congruent sides now you dont have to measure all your sides because have these so you ve got the same colors so they re all the same you re don t have to do angles kinda figure out ok so they re all 90 degrees one of yours looks 90 so you know they re 90s so you got for the outside of your figure you got some a little bit easier work yeah ok so you need to explain why things are 90 and what are congruent and then you re gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there then you ll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles so you know a lot about a square to start with yeah the equal sides have to be congruent and certain sides so write that then measure those angles and segments and see if you can t find some more rules that go with a square oh ok so yes your first set of rules for the first page from here you know a lot you know that any point and what they are you know you have equal sides then you don t have to measure these sides because you used the same color so you can explain it using the colors so you got a lot you know from the first part but then when you draw your diagonals here you re gonna have to measure your pieces see what happens to these angles see what happens to these diagonals and then see if you can t come up with some rules you re main part here you know a lot but now when we do this this will some of the new ok square is the last one that we teach so you will be the last group up there today right we re trying to get these rules today you can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there yeah there s just three of you ok how you doing good what do you notice about some of these corresponding is what i got here down here these are supplementary supplementary because they re what type of angles help him respond well there are options focus on one if we were to look at if i was continuing these lines here they re gonna be same side interior obviously yes so they re not quite supplementary so you might need to go back and do it again sammy knows they need to be supplementary same side interior somehow your measurements didn t get there so go back and try to remeasure you realize you wrote the error that s good so you re using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error yeah so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day when you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way you read 122 when it s going this way it s 118 so what you did is you read this way when you re going this way you said 122 when it s between 120 and 110 at least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it you said it was only off by one degree any amount then again to then explain your rules now what s congruent what s supplementary and then explain why like you were saying same side interior that s what you ll have yes do you have chester marlin yes i do please send him to the office ok what you did was perfect because they re same side interior so you would say this would you say equal angle one and angle four that d be fine because you can go ahead and when you re teaching it you can label those angles and that would be a really good way to do it so it s like angle one and angle four are same side interior same side interior so that has to equal 180 ok bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there your second page when you redraw the figure you re gonna draw the diagonals you re gonna see your diagonals cut each other you re gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half i ll be to ashley then at brandon s group in just a minute so make sure your congruent sides you don t have to measure your sides if you use your colors you can use colors to explain it so yeah you re exactly on the right track here we re just gonna draw the same figure draw those diagonals in there and then we got a little bit some more things you might see bisectors you might not some figures you do and some you don t all right ok it s up to you i love the way you put your letters there so you re getting really good with your letters you can say since you only have one angle at each letter you can say angle j or angle h however you want to do that could we just put supplementary and draw a little diagonal like that that d be fine actually do all these and you ve got your congruent and your angles then you re gonna redraw the same thing over here put your diagonals in and measure again when you put diagonals in you might see some that bisect the angles or bisect segments you might not but that s what you re looking for so this is gonna be well the diagonals we re not gonna draw one of them oh we re not no we re just gonna look at our diagonals otherwise you re breaking it into two other figures and that s a possibility but you don t have to i love the way that you ve lettered it here you re using those correct terms that ll be really good as you go up there all right brandon what all did we mess up so far let s see well it s a four sided figure what should a four sided figure add up to 360 360 does it no it s a little more than 360 so you might need to change things a little bit to remeasure it and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360 there s some that i see really right away that s good it s like 370 ok so you re gonna try to make it work you know you need to make it work you know it s gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better can we just add one here and add two there well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are but one good thing you see you see that these angles are the same which is something you re supposed to come up with which is good now if i was giving this when you re up there explaining it you need a way to explain and i know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent and in your picture that s good but sometimes let s think for a minute if i gave you write them out yeah it may always be the obtuse angle so here yeah that s what i was thinking if you were to do it this way the angles that are congruent aren t necessarily the obtuse ones so what you ve found is good but in your picture it is the obtuse ones but if you can see as you move that it doesn t have to be the obtuse ones let s look at a way we can describe you re saying that these two angles are congruent which is correct so instead of saying obtuse how can i explain that these two and not those two what s the difference between these two angles and those two angles they re 45 degrees well it didn t have to be it could be 45 it looks 45 if i was to do this it s not it s the short side s angles it s where your short sides meet your long sides so the angles with the non congruent sides or the short sides meet the long angles that would be perfect that would be a little better to explain it and even when you re up there explaining a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn t have to be and normally it s the bigger angles but it doesn t have to be draw diagonals that s right and you re gonna look for all the angles again when you draw your diagonals a lot of times you re gonna see bisectors like segments might bisect each other they might bisect angles they might or they might not so that s what you re looking for when you do that and then you re gonna kind of come up to we just draw them like this just like that that s right then you ll measure all of those angles and all of those segments we won t be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside because you won t have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals so you ll actually have to measure that part with a ruler but again you re not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else so that s what you ll do all right i ll be right back yes so are we supposed to do this you don t need the angles that are out there i mean you could but it s not necessary what should of course our figure add up to the angles inside uh huh 360 360 so make sure yours do what if they don t so i think if i was to look at your measurements here i know what i did i messed up i wrote these good perfect that s what i was gonna get to you read the wrong one and didn t notice all right i ll be right back how are you doing so you want to make some general rules so the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel i wouldn t really want to use the words top and bottom because what if you turn it this way yeah well a and b sides yeah so you re gonna do that so you ve got your pieces what do you notice about your angles you ve got the angles that are equal but what if i was looking for supplementary do you have any supplementary angles a and d a and d so you say a and d are supplementary what makes them supplementary what rule do we already know that was why they re supplementary they add up to 180 right they add up to 180 but are they same side interior angles same side interior angles so you can say they re 180 because they re same side interior angles then what you re gonna do you re gonna go to this page you re gonna draw your figure again but you ve got to draw your diagonals and measure the things when you draw the diagonals what you re really looking for is to see is there anything that cuts in half do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments some figures do some figures don t but that s what you re looking for so you re gonna redraw it draw your diagonals then measure you ll have more angles to measure you re actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won t match your diagonals correctly you re gonna have to actually do the measurements and see see if the segments are bisected see if the angles are bisected that s kind of what you re gonna come up with it may be it may not be some of the figures do and some don t ok i think i understand that we draw from angles to angles yeah from vertex to vertex that s right so make an x in the middle all right you re good yes i think we have about everything and then i think we have the other vertex angle bisectors they bisect the angle number five all the triangles are isosceles wow that s good i didn t think you d get that i m impressed he did it good job and then diagonals make a perpendicular perfect what i m gonna do is i m gonna give you another sheet make a bigger square,0.0
exactly right so what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically i know you re the big newspaper man and everything what do you think about that that s what i m talking about i m talking about the growth of the poem overall the first passage it s almost not objective but it kind of states what s happening it doesn t actually say what the author is thinking as the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it s more of the author s point of view and the author s stance on what s happening nora what do you think about the poem so far i thought it was a good like utilization of the message i m taking african american history this year okay we ve been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks so that first part we were talking about how they were like the sickness what are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything we have jettisoned the blind to no avail it spread the terrifying sickness spreads it s claws have scratched the sight from the captain s eyes the slaves were all tied together in their own so the sickness and disease could spread through them but also the slavers like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease that s where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they re in such close quarters that it s inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them superior as civilized but they re still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle so you really think that there s a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks who they think are savages i don t think it s even a point of transformation i believe that the author robert hayden is talking about this as it has been so this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they re sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it s like there s all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are er these whites are becoming like the blacks what s your favorite line that shows this nick standing to america bringing home black gold black ivory black seed now i especially liked the middle part of that black ivory because ivory is usually white of course yes yeah so you have the juxtaposition of black and white yes i think the lines after that deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones new england pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes jordan what do you think the about this religious connotation well seeing that i m not too familiar with the bible judaism and christianity are similar but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading i saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals these slaves and making the best of them in the new world between that and the evil that they re really bestowing upon the slaves standing to america bringing home black gold black ivory black seed is kind of glory and that contrast between evil deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones new england pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes they also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they re going through a time of spiritual crisis what port awaits us davy jones or home i ve heard of slavers drifting drifting play things of wind and storm and chance their crews gone blind the jungle hatred crawling up on deck it s like they understand that they re becoming uncivilized and they re trying to find a way to change this to justify their actions yeah that s what they need a justification for their actions so they say god is with them and everything is okay and you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn that jesus our savior pilot throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the god into all of this so that it s almost as if to me they re looking for their justification they re looking to justify the horrific actions that they re putting out which is ironic because these are often these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil so it s ironic that they re claiming that god is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks i think it s also ironic though that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world at the end talking about john quincy adams he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers the suffering that they had been enduring and that s like the moment of irony yeah the slavers are saying how paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august john quincy adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters and with his roman rhetoric weave a hero s garland for cinquez this is what i want you all to think about think about the historical connections here john quincy adams one of our founding fathers fourth president of the united states was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for cinquez and the other slaves that were on the amistad which is a ship that of course being discussed in here think about these historical connections i shall return all right group what s going on we re talking about a poem you re talking about a poem i m going to talk about a poem too what a coincidence i know isn t it coincidental what s going on what are you all discussing so far we re looking for the marrow part you re looking for the marrow part yeah i m glad you all have your beloveds out and everything what really interests me is the fact i think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated this is their story is it not what do you all think how can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of beloved in the second part in the last paragraph it says the fever is melting down my bones yes right now we re connecting that to stamp paid who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow as in his bone marrow we re looking for the page right now okay found it okay and it s on this whoa what is that read the passage to us my marrow is tired he thought i ve been tired all my days bone tired but now it s in the marrow it must be what baby suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life okay so let s connect what you say in this stanza you have i d be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones what is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion we thought that her fever is melting down we thought that it was it s pretty much the exact same connection because it s bones going into the marrow so the outside going into the inside the fever is melting down to my bones it s just taking a different way and to get more than a physiological point of view here the marrow is where where is the marrow in your bones it s like the core so raphael when we re suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way what does it mean for us it basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted okay so in essence then from a symbolic point of view just like in beloved we can relate this to the poem what kind of corruption do you see here for me it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy okay hypocrisy in what context mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right that they were different like this passage this short passage here it sickens me to think of what i saw of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men true christians all like so much jetsam yes and then at the very beginning they re talking about how they re throwing slaves overboard or even when the slaves decide to lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks sang as they went under yeah so there s this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning laura what do you think is going on in this particular context with all of the jumping off board it s a true escape to eternal freedom i guess if you believe in heaven the thing that confuses me is i understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over obviously death and more of a pain but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness the blindness and having to wait i think it s like another three weeks before they come to port so it s really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth this poem focuses i think on both sides on black and white yes it really does illustrate both which do you think is best illustrated laura the black side or the white side the black side is really i don t want to say common but it s similar to everything you hear about slave ships and the slave trade and the slave trade so i think it s interesting that hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don t really focus on what came of slavery even though it was a horrible thing on the last page here it says that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves i thought it was interesting because i often fail to make the connection that through the slavery we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the civil war jordan continue i was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about here it says their moaning is a prayer for death yes some try to starve themselves and then you go down one two three four stanzas later it says jesus savior pilot me over life s tempestuous sea we pray that thou will grant o lord safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls it s not so much praying for death it s praying and knowing that jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of who is praying for jesus here jordan the slaves really that s how i took it okay did anybody here take it a different way i took it as the sailors exactly good not that that s i think you re on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves so i think that they could be so i think there s a real sort of duality there for this point in history they evangelized evangelized they had already evangelized yes it s a hard word to say africa i know the dutch for example had already been there so historically speaking then raphael when you say it s the slavers that are the ones that are praying what s ironic about all of this that they re so much in the wrong and they don t see it all and that kind of hypocrisy and they re looking for justification for their actions speaking of justification what i want you to think about now for a few minutes i m going to talk to the other group up front here why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style it s all quotes it s all basically kind of like it s from a ship s log so think about this and i m going to be back to talk to you about it all right group what s going on it s all going on it s all going on okay tell me what have we discussed everything everything tell me more well we ve discussed about how in this stanza that there was hardly room tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon fashion there that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood that was talking about the capture of the africans yes who wouldn t be so thirsty that they wouldn t tear open their own skin and drink their own blood which is just crazy in terms of the suffering yeah and how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery and yet in the next stanza it talks about how the crew would lay with the the guinea rose yeah the crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins okay well let s talk about it for just a second we have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering what do you think yeah it s a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew like would sleep with these women exactly they re fully taking advantage of them imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey yeah it s a very big contrast because they are calling them animals so what happens after their lust in the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew they abandon the ship it goes up in flames exactly so it s basically set on fire and then what happens,0.0
but you re putting children in your sweatshops how are you gonna get more money how are you gonna finance the country still both of you need to listen to cambodia because cambodia i am awesome cambodia is awesome what are you doing to fix this well for the money problem i m not really sure but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you re getting better pay em off and then for and then for child labor you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn so that way they can get better skills and stuff and then put their after that works and everything to age laws i m the only one with an answer i have no child labor whatsoever whoa whoa whoa i thought we discussed that you do have child labor but well we do have some child labor but it s more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired so what do i win as the only one with an answer how did you pull your country off child labor you need to be giving them suggestions and ideas ok what can we do what can we do to crack you told us some solutions the other day right so that s why you guys are supposed to be discussing now ok china do you wanna go ahead and so china you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country you have a plan you have your whole plan in place pretty much what s the first step what s the second step what s the third step what you re gonna do yeah you wanna hear it i do first we ll make it illegal for children to work all day and the other half they go to school ok but wait a minute but don t your parents your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in yes but if they work half the day while they re at school they still earn money but then they re losing half their income but then on weekends they can but they work weekends right now anyway maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there oh now there s an idea what they could establish a minimum wage yeah ok so you re gonna establish a minimum wage yes and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they re employed so they can get more money with better jobs so then they don t have that issue so what are you going to do in the process because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated what are you gonna do in that gap you still have to have a plan for those 12 13 14 years what about programs like those they used in like the de de depression that s the word ok that s what you guys should be discussing those are some of the things you should be coming up with they could start keep in mind that needs money but then they would get loans from wealthier countries and as they re getting stronger and more ok take those ideas and work with them you guys are on the right track you re rolling with it so put that down establish a minimum wage ok cameroon what was your solution say the children stop working and the adults get it well it would be taking money away from the family not other than the ones we came up with on friday like have countries send money what about that like education like half school half work campaign it s like where where you re working part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home and then like with me in my country already go to school so i guess all those times you mentioned but they only go for like six years from age 7 to wait i don t know ok anyway that would help with like the country being france for the win like the same thing but more coffee ok if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things where s your country where s your country ok never mind i was thinking you move at the same time but no if we work together with the coffee export like if we combine the export if we produce well i meant like from whatever we sell we could try to hawk them together to help each other create better education y all can combine your profits in coffee and begin making schools you have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money correct right ok but remember you don t sell that product to the customers you re selling it to the businesses but that s bringing money in to your businesses it s the businesses that hire people and you create jobs so you need to figure out a way to take that industry that product and expand it so that it s bringing more money and bringing more jobs which is gonna help because then you ll have adults you have 45 income we can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs what would be a suitable age eighteen eighteen this mine is not an easy job is it it s hard work it s dangerous down there to have twelve year old kids down there you re still united nations correct is that gonna be agreeable to you you can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product so whatever she suggests to you you have to make sure that that s ok because remember you can tell her sorry it s not gonna happen yup which means you have more money going out than coming in correct so you need to figure out a way to change that you need some money coming in so what are the strengths your country has that you could potentially build and grow when she s got the diamonds i saw a pendant on the internet and it had like a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string ok that s a factory purchase but what you could make i don t know that s what you need to know what does your economy depend on i mean you have to produce something it says making foreign ok i have a question what is a foreign exchange it s nestea s largest exporter so you are exporting product so you do have some products that you re exporting oh you re taiwan you have a lot of textile factories you make clothing your country s the one that s got all the sweatshops so that s what you need you need to build you should be suggesting some ideas to her giving her ideas say ok you ve got a product to export but you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do this they need to find some way to pay exactly wait i have a question for the united nations ok how you said setting up your steps well if there s not a lot of educated people then how are they gonna find teachers well if you said exactly well first you could hire people from different countries maybe if you like hired somebody from like the us that s educated they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they re educated they re doing the same thing that kids are they ve been in child labor and stuff plus when they got older they re just working again so they haven t really changed anything so to change that i guess maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children so you couldn t get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers and the kids have no where to go well i say since they re already adults that we kinda like work on the children more with education i guess because the children are small so before you even take the kids out of these places you have to get all the people and you have to so you have to figure out some like you re gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that s gonna take it s basically you re taking elementary schools you like i mean they could set up a scholarship that way they could go from like and even your country could help pay help pay the people that are teaching because in the long run you re gaining that money s gonna be spent the population is gonna face it they get the cotton for the clothes and get the food for their teachers and all that if we can help poverty to help pay for some schools yes that would be amazing we could also have all the adults work the rest of their life like insanely or something i m the government i can say hey there s laws now that a kid s gotta go to school and he can t work so many days of work so many hours of work,0.0
it s big okay and that s all and the little blood cells and i drew one on there in kinda like a magnified and there s little blood strands they re blood strands dna strands now those dna strands are only in the blood are they anywhere else in your body they re in your hair and in your fingernails in your skin they re everywhere okay so it s not just in the blood but you usually get it from the blood blood okay alright it looks like you ve got a couple questions you can call on whoever you want me are these questions you guys are these questions for ryan okay how do you know chuck was right what well he s a pretty smart guy who chuck my uncle oh okay maybe even though there s a bunch of dna on the strand what does that have to how do you know that a piece of that dna came from either the mom or the dad that s why because dna comes from both of them the dad gives the dna and the mom provides the dna okay david it was in the blood right you said it was in the blood right yeah yes but couldn t blood be transmitted to another person because they had the yeah it could be transmitted to another person so that s not really a trait sure when someone gets a blood transfusion yeah right like if you re in the hospital and you re injured and you get blood transfusions if your eyes are blue and you get a blood transfusion from a brown eyed person does that turn your eyes brown no it could if okay does it give you a widow s peak when you have a straight hairline no okay if i get a blood transfusion tomorrow hopefully that doesn t happen but if i get a blood transfusion tomorrow is that going to give me a cleft chin no if the person had a cleft chin but how do people die when they get when they get blood transfusions carlos can we talk about that later maybe let s stick with how we get our traits do we get it through the blood okay not really girls what do you think over there i was sure it had something to do with the blood but that s between your parents and it has nothing to do with the traits so i don t know do you want to come over here too i want to come over there with the boys yes i you guys are you guys haven t even said anything yet and already they re they re joining your group okay should we hear from the people who think i ve got a large lorenzo do you want should we hear from you or are you thinking about coming over to this group too you re set okay let s hear from lorenzo okay lorenzo what do you think i think that it was that brown eyed people have more traits than blue eyed people because i know more people that are brown eyed than blue eyed and i think i read somewhere that usually brown eye is a dominant trait over the blue eyes so for most of the times brown eyed people if you have brown eyed parents you will get brown eyes but how is so you heard something about a dominant trait okay any questions about that dominant trait brown eyes being dominant trait because a lot of people have brown eyes like that and not many people have blue eyes true blue eyes are more rare okay lorenzo whoever you want to call on you ve got two people so like what you were saying right now something about your parents then you would get it from your parents hmm what because when he was when he was saying that about the traits he said you if your parents have brown eyes or blue eyes that you re gonna get that trait from them so from your parents so interesting do you get what she s saying what she s she s saying she s sticking with this group because it s coming from your parents okay that s why they say it s half and half okay also i m in your group too but what s it called yeah i see more brown eyes but still they always get their traits from the parents not only but a lot of people have some people still get blue eyes and then others it s because of they still get the traits from the parents and some of them don t look alike so what about what about some people have both of the parents have brown eyes and some of the kids turn they have their blue eyes though yeah that s great because that s a great how many of you guys have seen something like that i have seen it where two parents have one trait and then their kid has the opposite trait like brown eyed parents blue eyed kid you guys have seen that why does that happen what do you think i m not really sure i know my parents have brown eyes and me and you have green eyes yeah your parents both have brown eyes right and your eyes are blue yeah okay so why does that happen lorenzo since it was your idea let s hear from you if i m correct there s more brown eyed traits so you get if you have a brown eyed parent and a blue eyed parent you get a brown eyed trait and a blue eyed trait but because brown eyed is dominant most of the time you get brown eyed but you still have blue eyed traits so even if you have two parents with brown eyed trait if they both also have the blue eyed trait you could get blue eyes i have a question for you lorenzo you keep using this word dominant trait does in your mind does dominant mean more more when you re saying more traits in your mind does dominant mean there s more of it yeah okay what do you guys how many of you guys have heard this word dominant there s recessive too which is recessive okay does dominant mean more anyone know that it means power over the others like an overpowering trait he s trying to say are you trying to say more are you trying to say more or are you trying to say stronger stronger okay so this group the group you re sitting in the group one right now is someone who thinks that there s more traits come from the brown do you think that you re not sure say yes but you know something about dominant okay i ll stay with my group yes can i make my own group where it s like yeah good yes what are you thinking i m moving maybe it s just maybe that nature decides what something will look like because i don t know my parents have brown eyes and i have blue eyes and we don t really have anyone else who has blue eyes you re picking the wait a minute fiona no olivia yeah nature okay nature makes so you ve got blue eyes nature had something to do with that not your parents yeah okay anyone want to respond to that ryan how does nature do that how does nature choose your eye color doesn t it have something to do with your parents of course how could you just a slot machine where it s like ching and then the eye colors roll around and stuff oh you got blue eyes i don t know let him respond you re not sure no i m not sure i m still any other questions oh yeah and like you know how i was gonna ask this what if you get it from your grandparents or your grandparents have black eyes or from your aunts or something i really don t know if your aunts and sisters yeah what if his aunt and sister has blue eyes that s right what if somewhere way back someone in your family had blue eyes you guys better i don t see how that how does that happen does anyone know people who look like their grandparents yeah my cousin does lorenzo my mom said that i look like my grandparent because i have a mole or something that s in the same spot as my grandpa if that s the case for you does that support what he s saying nature decides or does that keep you in what you re thinking it keeps me in but i have a question okay how do people one eye is blue and the other one is green oh i know that one that s a mutation no no some people have really yeah like all right let s refocus let s refocus we haven t heard from this group we haven t heard from the few groups that have the most amount of people in them okay so let s give them a chance to talk ladies can you start us off you guys read it i have to read it we agree that people get half their traits from their parents we think this is a trait from both of their parents also for example that what for example if one person has one parent has because for example for me i have my dad s eyes and i have my mom s my mom s she has traits from some from your mom and some from your dad okay yeah it looks like you ve got someone who wants to say something about that but if what if you get more if you get some traits from your ancestors too and not just your parents what about your that would just go back a generation though does that still support what you re thinking yeah no because we re talking about the parents how they have half yeah but you then also get from your parents some of them so some people don t look like their parents at all but they look like someone else in their family i m seeing this issue come up again what about grandparents kids who look like their grandparents how does that happen does anyone here wanna any of you guys go ahead you still get it from your parents because your parents if your grandma has it then that trait is somewhere in your mom or your dad it just doesn t show up as much so it can transfer back to you what can we call that that there s a trait in you and you just don t see it does anyone know a word for that invisible i heard it over here recessive yes recessive okay who else has heard recessive raise your hands scientists call a recessive gene a gene that does not express itself it doesn t mean it s a little gene that s quiet it just means that it s a gene that s not showing or a trait sorry a trait that s not showing that s called recessive you also want to talk about this more a little bit more let s stay on this topic i think it will help us figure it out yes ryan like he was saying it s probably about the dna strands when they when two people combine in different parts or put in different pieces of it like maybe one like maybe the blue eyes is out and brown eyes goes in there or maybe when they have one of those recessive genes the recessive genes get it goes into the strand too maybe when tyler said that none of neither of his parents have blue eyes maybe his grandpa or his grandma or their grandparents maybe one of them had blue eyes and it was in his mom or his dad and it went into the strand that he was created from it didn t show up in the mom but then it popped up in the kid yeah okay david i don t know i think i don t know if i agree with him but i think i kind of do because like he said it was dominant but he still has he still has a little bit in him so it s kind of like a well because you still have some of your traits or your parents still kind of have a little bit how are okay how are how is this idea that brown eyed kids have i m sorry brown eyed there s more traits in brown eyes right is that what this idea is about all you guys right here how is that like this one that we get half from mom and half from dad or how can we use some of this thinking and layer it onto some of this thinking so they re both right the question is how are those two the same right how are that one and this one the same how are pieces from this how do we use pieces from this idea that lorenzo is bringing up dominant and recessive how do we use pieces from this and combine it with pieces from this group over here let me get you to talk about that with your group let me ask i ll ask that question one more time what s right about what these guys are saying and how can we add it to stuff this group is thinking what if the kid is born blind right or what if the kid comes out deaf and blind some express themselves and some don t woo that you just gave me a brain scan because you read my mind say there s two dna strands one in this hand one in this hand they combine the dominant ones from each of these take over and make one of all the dominant ones that were in them can you give me an example with tyler maybe there was a dominant gene the blue eyes was dominant maybe it was passive before it started whatever it s called recessive and then it became dominant but over time and then it went in tyler how can a dominant gene become a recessive gene and become dominant again maybe every time it gets passed down hmm like with us we get bigger what if your if your mom had two blue eyed parents but ryan here today and they combine i found it all right are we ready to pull back all right i didn t get to hear from all these two groups but i did get to hear from them i think what this group has is something good and i think you guys want to hear it you re gonna be the spokesperson for that group great we agree that people get mom and 50 from their dad we think this because if there s two people who made the baby then it s logically should be split in half but all every time someone has a baby all of their genes of both parents go into the baby only some of them decide to express themselves and show go ahead say i have two dna strands from two different people say mary and joe mary and joe both had grandparents that both have blue eyes and that gene got passed down to them now they combined to make one gene say mary had blue eyes had a blue eyed gene and joe had a blue eyed gene those two genes combined to make one dominant blue eyed gene and it goes in like what tyler like with tyler right so we tyler he used you as an example your parents both have brown eyes right mm hmm and what were you guys saying about his parents both have brown eyes but something they had something else too yeah because everyone kind of has a little bit of everything in them it s just some some color or some trait just decides to show because it s more dominant you know the movie you know the movie that movie they went to some place and they went to go get found out they got the book from some person and they matched it up to ours and it was different colors so they had different kind of genes for like for things so if you compare a baby who has blue eyes and one who has brown eyes it s gonna have it s gonna have different things with the eyes the dna thing will be different maybe those dna genes that in a dna maybe they would look different for a blue eyed person than a brown eyed person yeah did you wanna say something maybe the dna of tyler s parents for example if their grandparents had blue eyed dna accumulating in them it might have been passed down through them and then when they got to where they were forming tyler inside their his mom s stomach it might have the blue dna might have overpowered combining those two blue dnas by getting it might have overpowered the brown eyes which made tyler get the blue eyes 50 it could be like 50 that happened in my family they re saying what color eyes are your parent s tyler what s your mom s eye color brown oh yeah what you got on your mom s side from my brown eyed mom brown so what about your mom s mom what about your dad s what about your dad all right you guys let s talk let s talk for a second if we ve got an example of one person in science you never hang everything on one person let s be careful about that and we don t want to have him be the reason for all but this is a good example do we think that people can have genes in them that aren t showing but then they can have a kid and then those genes pop up yeah because if the two genes did you want to say something about it lorenzo yeah because i think that if a parent had brown eyes and one had blue eyes but the brown eyed parent also had some blue eyed genes then the baby would probably come out blue because it has the blue eyed gene and then half of the blue eyed gene from the other parent how could we figure out how we get our traits for sure because we have a lot of ideas but what in science class what will we do what kind of activity could we do what kind of research could we do how would we find out we could go on askjeeves com and we so we could look it up on the internet okay guys one resource we could look at how else could we figure this out we could take a survey didn t we do that the class we did no but we could whole school so we have more to research or more i don t know make a larger sample size then we get information and we find out that x percent of our students have brown eyes and x percent of our students have blue eyes how does that help us find out where those traits came from it gives us more of an idea their parents and their grandparents too and their great grandparents we d have to ask people to we d have to ask people to do some research on their families okay so we could do some family research sonja we could make up an assignment sure okay,0.0
it s similar to when we had the hand warmer what happens is when you add heat energy to the hand warmer it makes the water rise up so in the glass in the two liter bottle in the glass too the heat lamp added heat to it the heat energy then the water started to rise up of the water okay so why do you think the water spilled over last time i think that it s because of the molecules expanding okay and then the molecules didn t have enough room well the water didn t have enough room so it had to get out so then it popped out through the tube okay do you share the same idea yeah do you agree with her yes okay alright let s talk about this yes i have something like with mine we thought that since there was oxygen i mean there was a glass tube that the water had room to expand and like spill out so what s why it did okay thank you alright let me ask you something how many of you put that water molecules expanded raise your hand as a reason for water spilling alright okay they gave you the reason why right so who can tell me why you put that alright rebecca i put that because well you see it well in the bottle lab we had water in there so when it heated up they expanded and they didn t have enough room so they had to it had to come out so molecules got bigger right yeah if you don t believe molecules got bigger what did you guys think that the water spilled over yeah i think if the water molecules didn t get bigger i think that the heat caused them to move around and bump into each other okay so what is the evidence for both of these you played with the water heater where is the evidence to support this anybody anthony like what i think is that that the steam is like mostly involved with this cause the only type of air water has is steam and like since the water was heated so intensely it had to let out all the air it contained so it spewed out steam okay thank you very much good job i m gonna go over with moorea why do you think that water you didn t agree with water molecule being expanding right yeah so what is your evidence that it is not expanding well i think when we added the heat to the water i think the molecules started getting hotter and the heat was transferred from the lamp to the molecules and they started moving around more kind of like how sugar makes people like have a sugar rush and kind of move around more and get more excited and then they just needed more room so they spilled out into the tube okay now let me ask you something if that is true how come if i press it here it s going down why yes tyshon because of the heat in your hand what s happening the heat of my hand right saron so it goes down faster because the heat in your hand is enclosing around the top i guess so it will make it come down jake i m not sure but i think it goes down faster yes because of everybody else saying that when you hold from the heat of your hand but i think it s also because gravity pushes things down okay alright alec has two finger means he has something to add i agree with jake and i also think that since the water went down it s because it had more room at the bottom so when you put your hand around it it immediately goes down also because of gravity and how it has more room how did you come up with that answer well when you were holding the top i saw that the bottom was empty and like so i thought that cause of gravity when you hold it at the top it has more room to go down but if you hold the bottom look at the whole bottom hold the bottom what s happening it s right there it s against the gravity it s going up so hold on i m gonna provide the evidence about the result this is computer simulation watch this carefully i want you to watch this carefully and look at this the right side is water okay the right side is water and did i turn the heat on yeah yeah okay so who turned it off i m gonna reset it okay and then heat is off watch look at air and water molecule let s look at the water molecules first since we re doing the liquid part are you with me yeah alright what is happening to water molecule write it down with your group you ve got 30 seconds talk to the group molecules are vibrating very slightly since the water s mostly cooled down more than the air it s more stable it s like doesn t vibrate as much as air cause water is like more still and more like a solid than air okay please observe everything and i m going to be asking you questions alright and here we go i m gonna turn the heat on as a group you need do discuss and write everything down what you see here just the air i mean i m sorry just observe the water yes everything okay here we go group water only okay now discuss with your group alright water only the water molecules they aren t moving around like the air ones but they re vibrating they re moving like back and forth they re vibrating like really violently they re staying in the same general area like but the water ones are like i m sorry the molecules in the air are bouncing around and when the heat is applied they start bouncing around faster i agree with maor but i think that with the air ones that they have more room to bounce around that the water is all contained in one thing so the molecules have to stay in one position but the air has to what do you think ladies you haven t said anything i think the same thing as maor because the air molecules have more room to the surrounding because it s really nothing in there and since water is a liquid it has less room whatever i see that the more the heat gets on the water alright 30 more seconds so we re gonna start the discussion there are people who need more time to write but you already know what to do so here we are okay i m gonna call on individuals so please do so you don t have to stand up ivree i saw that when you turned on the lamp it started vibrating faster than which one we re talking about which one the water okay vibrating faster joon po you think through the temperature also started rising very little excellent dylan what else did you notice i m noticing that when the heat is on the water is starting to vibrate very fast when it s turned on but they are staying stationary they re not actually moving anymore so why do you think the water molecules are vibrating chelsea because of the heat that is going on to the molecules so what you re saying is the heat source is going to molecules class what do you call the heat source which is the lamp what is it heat energy heat energy very good so in this case i don t know if you agree with chelsea raise your hand how many of you disagree raise your hand alright how many of you agree with chelsea raise your hand okay alright the molecules are transferring energy the heat energy is transferring heat to the energy thank you very much now next part i m going to give you a life problem to solve and i want you to come up with solutions okay how many like to play ping pong oh excellent you know i grew up playing ping pong because in asian culture ping pong s a lot cheaper to purchase than basketballs so most every home has ping pong or ping pong table because it s easy to make out of wood now having said that suppose you received a set of ping pong balls for holiday because you asked for it from your parents and your parents being really nice and you behaved really well they decide to give you these ping pong balls you got the problem is you lost all of them except one and your best friend came over to play with this but he stepped on it on accident so now here s a dent right he has to fix it can you fix it you re all worried because you ve never seen anybody can fix this so give me some suggestions by talking to your group alright you have buddies back up there alright kind of like the water bottle right especially like you can fix another part maybe you could do the same thing with the ping pong ball like if you start to squish the ping pong balls down and maybe you could its place it d be easier to pop it out i think you can apply air you can apply air like with heat like at least heat cause you know when the heat was added to the water right like you could apply air with a little do you need more time like the thing okay so i m going to write the solution alright by asking group that has an answer just stand up one at a time the group that hasn t answered yet alright so here s a solution say ping pong ball dilemma alright okay number one which group is gonna be just stand up just stand up if you haven t spoke in this group we already thought that you could try and use your hands and like pop the air back into it and get it to its original shape okay alright number two something different which group that hasn t spoken yet okay chelsea s group alec said that if you push around the edges it might pop back into shape so kind of the same thing yes we think that somehow if you maybe poked a hole in it you can use like an air pump or some sort of machine to get the air in it and maybe the air will push against the dent and make it a sphere again let s see how many of you believe this dilemma raise your hand okay alright how many of you believe this is gonna work raise your hand how many believe this is gonna work alright is there a third option anybody okay yes i don t know if this will work but maybe you can put in front of a lamp okay excellent start but why would you put it in front a lamp let me ask you something maybe so that the molecules in it like in the water example maybe they ll start like vibrate no you re okay well it s air so you want to add heat energy right yeah you want to add heat alright so we re gonna try all of those so let s try with number one so i m going to give sasha a ping pong ball that s been dented by my best friend or not my best friend her best friend so she s gonna try to do it okay number two is what pop a hole in it so how many of you disagree with this or of this idea why would you disagree with this idea dylan because if you poked a hole in it it would be kind of like ruin it and release all this stuff and it would be kind of hard to okay what are you ruining in this case the ping pong ball in other words what you re saying is a surface of the thing yeah okay did you try yeah like it s really hard so it s actually hard to pop it back in let s see who s strong me okay you re strong she wants to do it if she doesn t work then let s do it okay how about the lamp lamp thingy so let s see are you the one that says the come on over okay leave it like this turn the heater on okay on the top yeah that s it the other way there you go right there yeah there you got it oh okay oh what happened it helps if it s connected isn t it okay try that again there so we re gonna time it while we re working on this for a couple minutes okay alright okay alright so who has the ping pong now the dent was too strong okay now look at the ping pong ball i m gonna show it to you okay look you saw it right all of you what happened it has more dents not only the dent what else it broke is this gonna work that s completely ruined what did that do nothing alright so let s say first idea is no good okay so second idea poke a hole we agreed that it s not gonna work because it s gonna compromise how many of you agree with that it s gonna compromise the shape of the thing okay alright the third idea alright it s about a minute nothing s happening okay do you have any other suggestions who hasn t said anything sydney i think maybe you could like put it between your hands because it might work the same as the lamp but just faster okay so how many agree that looks like both of you if i m not mistaken that you have to have some kind of heat right you said because i said because like the water it needs room to expand well it s not actually expanding but it needs room to move so the ball will probably expand okay i m gonna show you this simulation is there something yes dylan yeah i want to add maybe it would work better under a stronger heat source okay like a sun yeah like okay can i tell you something that i did before the class i put it under the lighter and the ping pong went like pshhh you know to be honest with you the ash was big as this one that was it i was looking for ping pong ball it ll burn alright now i want to show you this simulation again okay so bear with me here you all said the two things i m gonna talk about you all said the molecules were expanding meaning molecules are getting bigger right tell me is this molecule getting bigger no okay so molecules are not getting bigger how many of you believe it s not getting bigger remember simulation is evidence is that what is happening like many of you said already jake they re moving around really fast in the space for air and water they re vibrating so look at the air this time alright the air so class which one would you say is moving faster air okay so air is moving faster okay we re gonna discuss this next step so everyone s gonna get a big picture you have a question i need to see the finger thing yes i have a i guess reason well i have another thing that i noticed about that i guess you could say i think that the reason why the water molecules are moving slower is because the water is taking up space and they can t travel around that fast because in the air there s really nothing in there that s stopping them from moving but i guess you can compare it to us when we re swimming under water we move slower than we normally do on land yeah so air molecules are moving really fast right so what s happening as it s moving very fast sydney you have something to add okay i was just gonna say if you look at water it sort of looks like it s in an invisible cage and it s trying to move around but it can t so it s restricted it doesn t move as well,0.0
today is wednesday yes i would clone myself good why why would you clone yourself because everybody deserves a second me so you would just and i would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on honestly what would some of the negatives to cloning something like that well it s another me but it s still good because you know i m me and i m good and bad do you know your clone is not going to be like set right you re gonna have to wait for it to grow up so i have to raise a little baby clone of me yes and it ll look just like me when i was a baby pretty much oh that s wrong oh my god there are so many possibilities alright so let s start off with i ll get it a baby raise your hand if you can remind us like what is cloning there s only one of you like taking the dna or like i don t know like whatever out of one person like trying to like duplicate it into another one okay great we re all well was there only like one type of cloning what were some of the different types well one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only and another one is let s see animal and livestock cloning anything else you want to add to that gady so what s one way they do the cloning so they take the dna from one animal what do they do do you remember what parts they used like what kind of cell they used nucleus they did take the nucleus and they used the eggs of the other animal okay it s kind of interesting you can take the egg from one animal and completely change its dna so now when that turns into a new organism it s an identical copy of the animal that it came from and if you take you can bring back endangered species too because remember that or whatever then they put in the cow yeah but they were like related in some kind of way so it wasn t like weird that s true it was probably a decendent do you guys remember that from the video they had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct in fact they couldn t actually do the tests on the animal remember they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn t even do the tests on them right how long did last does anyone remember three days yeah it was about three days right but it was the first time so when they couldn t open up that cow the cow died right i don t know that for sure but i m guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically they were oh no i was just wondering because there s a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb that s true that does happen i mean i don t care if the cow died honestly that s another hamburger for me but that goward that goward that s swole you can t get any other animal like that anybody else in here agree that it s okay to do that testing to save endangered species well yeah because if there s like a hundred million cows and one whatever that thing was called so we should probably try and get more of them yeah why not okay we should clone pandas let s hear somebody else though is there anybody else that has i said alligator try and bring it back that s true what happens when there s so many i mean how many of you have ever watched the movie jurassic park oh my god i ve seen all of them at least twice so that s a good question so if we can bring back something that looks like a cow fabulous what happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool but has bigger teeth well you see it breaks out of the cage like in jurassic park the lost world and it starts attacking all the great well yeah it kind of started eating people that was wrong fabulous but what could be some of the downfalls on that like any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct well hardly any of the you need to the dna might get messed up yeah but remember that when we re messing around with the dna yeah maybe there could be a mistake what happens then it could die it could die yes i would say one good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to that s probably what scientists are thinking wouldn t that be great if i could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does because a lot of things they tell you about you know dinosaurs is what they think they do well we think they eat this and we think this is how they lived wouldn t it be great if we could actually study those what if dinosaurs were never real well they found skeleton remains so they re pretty much sure they were around they also found because you can t just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive because it will mess up the chain of life anthony has a really good point because what s going to happen if we have dinosaurs we can t just stick them somewhere for them to roam around because they don t have anything they can naturally eat anymore and they don t have any natural predators anymore that s why you just bring back t rexes and velociraptors and what not then you just feed them cows you don t know if they necessarily eat cows though you don t know that well it s meat it is meat but that s also your food source well that s not going to be maybe eight or nine maybe 25 for a t rex you re underestimating the size of some of these animals but the same thing applies to actual animals instead of just dinosaurs what happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses and we re expanding our cities so we re moving into some areas where there are some animals and they start to die off because we are taking over their land so yeah we could make a hundred copies of these animals or whether it s plants or birds or certain insects but that is a good question where are they going to live if we just bring them back wildlife park so that is a good thing and again remember that you all add because if you put them somewhere that a park they won t necessarily survive so you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that so yeah the food chain interesting how everything s connected raise your hand if you d like to share one of your questions from yesterday we ll start with anthony okay so like say me and this lady get married we both can t have kids so they take my dna and they make a clone of me i m married to this person would that be only my child or would that be our child and if why maybe yeah but what if you re married well does it require two people that has your dna i m sorry i didn t hear you maybe it is maybe it s totally the environment who s to say maybe if you raise it and you re like this is our kid well because of that case then there can t be any more like if we depended on cloning there woudn t be any well there d be less drama in the world because we wouldn t be doing stuff the natural way and like people being knocked up in bars and stuff and random places and stuff and like not knowing their father in life you know but you know what i m saying right do you think it would be hard like what if people were 100 dependent on this there would be a lot less problems eventually if you keep cloning yourself and then your clone cloned itself and your clone clones itself you d have the same group of people you d have the best group ever yeah but how would you know because you wouldn t be here that s dumb that s what that is that s interesting we can t have just a bunch of the same people that d be one stupid that d be dumb man i don t know walking around seeing all the same people that s stupid you re not going be like like the matrix everything repeating other questions let s get one from a female this time we got the guys questions let s get a girl don t all shout out all at once mayra what s one of your questions i said like if they clone a sheep and it s like sick wouldn t it or let s say there s a regular sheep and they clone that wouldn t the clone be sick too what did she say not necessarily no because it s like you said it s two entire different bodies of life a lot of things can go wrong in one person so how could it just be the same thing two different unless it s like a problem with an organ that the one had and then well i want to say that like a disesased kid maybe what about remember you just did genetics right if it s in your dna what would happen if it was in your dna it probably would get it if it was something that it caught it probably wouldn t get it that s true so it depends i guess maybe what it is right so you have this sheep just cloned it and because it has something very serious with it and if it s genetic then yeah there s probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on i think they were showing remember when they were doing dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned i think they were talking about the sheep dolly and then they had some mice that they had cloned they had said that the animals they had cloned does anyone remember what any of the side effects what they ve noticed sometimes they can t breathe right what else sometimes they died really young so just because it s a clone maybe we haven t quite figured it out yet because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal if they re dying younger or having problems growing other questions hector what is one of your questions or if you don t have your questions ready or you feel like your questions were answered maybe you just have a comment you have none what do you think about cloning do you agree with it or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it um i agree with it like the pros i would agree with it like for food for what like cloning for more food oh like the chickens right cloning to make more chickens wouldn t it be great if i have a perfect chicken and i could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken i ve had all types of chickens they all taste the same that s true everything tastes like chicken but have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick well like a tiny little drumstick they still taste good true but what one gives you more food you got a point there okay so maybe right but still you could put them together in the case of kfc the reason why their chicken s so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big yes that s the way they approach that that s the best way to do that right there not really people get cancer from that so would this be a good solution so instead of making eating our cows and feeding pigs and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones to make them larger and grow faster would it better to just take the large big cows and just clone them or make chicken and make copies of it yes no does anyone see any maybe this sounds really great like we re going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat but is there any downside to that no honestly no i don t think so not for you great is there anybody else money money how they could cost more to but they could cost less and be more affordable which is what we want good money is a good issue right people won t have to think about money issues i don t think there d be a money issue if you were cloning chickens because you can always just get you know take a syringe and like but that s what he was saying that maybe it d be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff yeah mm hmm it would take longer what do you guys think about the cloning for body parts can i go back to the chickens for a second sure go for it wouldn t there be a lot less farmers so then there d be a lot less jobs because you know like the whole that is true like a lot of companies will go out of business because i don t know i feel like there s like a monopoly on it more private industries are going to go out of business and that s going to destroy livelihoods because all the big livestock companies like kfc and mcdonald s well they re not a livestock company they re fast food but they re going to be selling it to those right they re going to let it go off of just by show of hands who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with that s just because you guys are okay with dying chris not sure or does it just kind of i don t care really what was the question oh i said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food no before that the one before anthony started talking we were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens we ll get there i know the question we ll get there i want to say something we ll get there alright erica medical the cloning the body parts like if people are sick and they need a new heart or new lungs or a new kidney ms scott i wrote the name of it it s called therapeutic cloning they refer to it that way so that s what it s called when you do that so when we re using it for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues whether it s like just a few cells or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries what do you think about that i think it s a good idea it s a good idea do you have any reasons to be worried about that it would be better than nothing any concerns anybody else have you heard of of a book called what was it called i don t think i have what s it about that s okay levon is going to have to read it now because he ll be like what it s about like in the future will people if parents don t want their kids any more they can like they can give them a like they can take their other body parts off and they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff so they like your body parts are still alive so one arm could be like your real arm and your other arm could be like interesting i ll have to read that book sometime now when they re doing the therapeutic cloning they re not actually creating like a whole new human and then the body parts up there s a couple of different ways they were doing it do you remember what they were using to how they were growing the organs that is true but what were they trying to do with the cloning how are they trying to avoid that do you remember does anybody remember how is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting because do you guys remember what happened to the woman close very close to that so remember when you get a body organ like the lady with the kidney right who d she get the kidney from her aunt yeah so she got it from her aunt somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family like they were a match she had to take remember all of those pills she had to take to make sure her body doesn t like get rid of the kidney and then unfortunately it still did so they re looking at getting making kidneys and i think that they were growing them inside of a cow i think it was a cow might have been a pig it was a big animal so you re going to grow human kidneys that are functional mm hmm on a cow they were using another animal and they were actually growing it like not in the animal it wasn t part of the animal they were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning so on the outside of a cow there d be kidneys underneath the skin yep and then they would take take them out and transplant them into humans this is like that episode of south park where it s a little bit inappropriate but not too much then let s not go there it s a little too inappropriate then let s not nevermind nevermind you re going to watch it for yourself fabulous but they are also trying by cloning because remember a lot of times they re trying to find animal parts that might match like for example did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart so you could have a pig heart they were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts the problem is of course is it s a pig s heart which means the outside of the heart looks like pig cells so your body would know that it s not a human heart it would know that it s a pig heart and your body probably won t want that in its body so they were trying remember they had trying to grow new pigs i think they had little piglets running around the pigs had human dna in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside so that when they keep those body parts if they put them in a human your body wouldn t recognize it as being something different did you know they ve actually done that my dad s friend s daughter has pig intestines,0.0
what do you think it is going to be this time i think it s going to be like negative 57 59 maybe like 54 or something colder or hotter you don t need to touch you don t need to touch it you and your temperature i got a playing with your go down the temperature is going to go down with the ice it was 22 22 no not 22 you think ice the temperature is going to go down the water went up it s your choice how much of anything you put in should we put a lot a little more a little more why don t you dump it into not the whole thing yeah oh don t put it all in like that there s hardly any room ready go science is kind of messy isn t it it s okay just put it back in there and work together tell me when to go ready ready and start what do you think i think it s going to be like maybe 20 degrees or maybe negative 10 we ll just have to see 40 jacob 40 no it s 50 40 50 degrees it s almost it s 50 degrees jake it s 50 degrees it s 50 degrees jake what s he doing so where s the line try to put one in oh so now you get it where s the line and it s 40 40 comes out like 44 what s the temperature it changed 44 it says 40 no it s 44 jacob it doesn t matter what are you having a dispute about here get out now it was right here so it s on it s not even gone down and now it went up to what well a little higher than that yours went up so what did how do you know jacob by looking at the thermometer how it went up or down explain to me i know how it went up because i see because if you turn your head away and then you look at it it went up you think so how do you read this though are they there s five lines right let s see but how do you break it up so you can read it to get from 70 to 80 how do you break that up jacob do you know um right you count by twos okay you guys get busy i m interrupting your experimental time you re scientists here down all the way down just color it up to 50 down 30 i wonder what was in it i think it s salt i don t think it s salt last time i used last time i used it it went down and then it went down even more that s what i told you it s floating i m breathing in good water water what happened use the thermometer ready set go one more i think it s going to get colder and i think it s going to get i think it s going to get negative 10 what do you think emily zero degrees maybe negative zero i m not sure there is a negative zero it s like frost all over it cold frost right here whatever was in it makes it go down temperature go down makes frost mystery is salt the mystery grain is salt the mystery grain is salt it s melting the ice and it s condensing on the outside ready guys five four what do you guys think it is what do you think the temperature s going to be this time i don t know lower than 50 555 degrees that would be toasty got to be lower one two three four five i see that most of you have finished your experiment i would like to call and see i m going to get some questions take it out okay eight i have questions teagan your group needs to come to me please thank you very good jacob what did you notice between the base temperature and the first time when you put the water in what happened i noticed that when the base temperature when we put in the base temperature it was only water it only changed by one degree it only changed by one degree very good number nine who s number nine kayla kayla what did you guys notice about the temperature we what happened to it what happened to the temperature it went down it went down what happened to your can who knows think about that take a minute with your group i want you to talk about what s happening to your can and why so maybe it got frost for they get more frost on it when i put and it got yellow the water was clear and then it got yellow when we put salt in it got dirty it looks like lemonade it s all mushy the stuff is looking to the ice that and making it squishy okay one two three four five come back to me for a minute i pulled number five number five what is happening to your can it s getting frost on it it s getting frost on it why do you think it s getting frost what did your group think that it was getting frost on it from the ice and the mystery ingredient the mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty what did we learn about with the weather cycle we talked about that what s really happening talk in your group is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what s coming that s making the stuff on the outside of the can there is water on the side of the can maybe the mystery thing making condensation on the can and because i learned a lot about that i think the mystery one and the ice did it together that could be yeah that could be and combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can i think that the water the mystery ingredient okay one two three four five number three what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff what s that wet stuff called ella condensation it s called condensation what do you why is that happening to your can number three that s you right luke okay what s happening because it s like evaporating and when it touches the cold can then it turns back into cold water what s evaporating stop don t answer that think in your group what he said it s evaporating and then it s touching the can what s touching the can talk in your group figure out if you can figure out what s coming to touch your can so well really it can yeah it s kind of melting so the water is on the can so it s the mushy icky i know whatever mystery stuff now i ll take it it makes me and then it makes water water water everything you know water how will eve s last question nope we re just asking questions right this second you guys need to wait then we re gonna one two three four five come back to me number 19 who s 19 ella okay ella what is happening to make that can wet on the outside the water and the ice well the water tries to evaporate but since there s ice at the top it hits the ice and then it comes back down but then it gets on the can so the water you think the water in the the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that hit the ice good thought let s keep going let s see if we can get some more who is number 12 hayden hayden s not here so let s move on and let s find number nine who s number nine kayla kayla kayla what s happening to your can what s happening to it and why it frosting it s frosting,0.0
what are you noticing about it compared to these two this one s light brown these are all dark so i think this one s not getting enough water so we should water it what s happening because it s not getting enough water it s like drying out what s happening to the seed the seed is dying it can t grow and the seed s gonna die yeah because what s the first stage of a life cycle and you have water in it it s a seed yeah and then it sprouts but on this one all stems are dying oh wow that looks really dry so which one are you measuring we re measuring water okay let s measure it let me measure it okay let s measure it and let s record how tall it is i don t know how you use it yeah almost four inches centimeters here i ll measure it seven and a half centimeters can you hold it yeah maybe if you hold it oh no it came out it s okay it s alright we ll just ours came out and then it s still good just hold him up it s six centimeters okay let s check wow it s growing two times enough keep it there and let s see let s see if the rest of your group agrees yeah i agree that leaf is up to six centimeters okay so what in in a week how much has it grown it s grown three three centimeters three centimeters yeah three centimeters okay write and record it so that s parsley write write why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato because the tomato is like a tomato has one thing and parsley has the same thing and they come out what do you mean the same i think maybe because parsley because parsley has a rose it s easier because because a tomato has more time to grow because it like it s the kind of vegetable that has which is actually even drier can you guys help her out can you help her out i think well i think that s growing better than the roma tomatoes is tomato a fruit day one like it s growing a fruit that s what the tomato is like a vegetable it s the fruit of the plant yeah that we eat but i think that what i think it s important is that we grow this yes yes they ll grow at different times once they grow it ll grow fast yeah we started this one planting faster right we started this one two weeks later do you think we need to water the tomato more though yeah when you look at the parsley and feel feel how wet that one is and it s doing so well i know compared to the tomato maybe we need to water more yes is this parse it s the parts no it s the gender i think they need to get more sun and water okay so abby s measuring her tomato i did it what do you guys want to do do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem top of the leaf top of the leaf the leaf is part of the plant okay so you re putting it down all the way down down and round it s four okay it s four alright four so every single time when you measure this plant are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem is that what you re going to do yeah it started four sessions ago it started four sessions ago this one started two weeks before this one let s look at the measurements and how much for growing can you compare these two what are some things that you notice i notice that it s grown three and a quarter centimeters everything else won t be able to have two more centimeters g plant can you tell me which one s growing quicker this one are pregnant are you sure about that yes actually maybe because this started out and this one not so here before okay and we started this one when we started this on i mean two weeks ago two weeks after this one yeah so even though this one was started later what s happened it s growing more faster taller yup okay why do you think and you guys even noticed that it was dry and it s still growing faster yeah so should we keep water should we water it more and see what happens yeah what do you want to do i want to want to since there s no more seeds in there because we took two of them out and then the other one died i think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens okay go ahead you can plant it and there are sometimes seeds they just won t germinate they re sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won t they won t grow maybe that s what happened to this one too can i go through and bob it but in the inside of it it looks very dark but the outside of it does so maybe it s not as dry as we thought yeah now we have to take measurements again we ll just see if that helps there s only this one left let s look at this seed what do you notice about it i know for we came from last time when we grow the parsley this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed these are not dead how about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed it s really small and things can use the lines smaller maybe because they re smaller things or like a sunflower oh so you think maybe the seed the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be yeah okay on that some of the tomatoes are as big as that or bigger than that sometimes the seeds are how they start out are smaller but sometimes the shape of it sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes but others not you mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant sometimes yeah it could what about a flower or something flowers seeds are different they all look different no so is that always the case no but some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger and so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster or slower compared to these two plants than yours and maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference alright you guys can get online yeah you can go ahead and water it one in here and one in here and then i want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you e done you might want to water it a lot more let me try and then over it we finished watering our plants do we each get a computer we need help when we type into trying capitals in it it deleted our numbers so okay we didn t know what was wrong well you have your title plant type let s be more specific because you re not doing all the plants what plant are you graphing right now swiss chard and kale did you measure them already yeah and then we drag the numbers but then they don t i think it s because of all that room james where is your measurement for swiss chard for today right here you want to record that swiss chard and kale was what was kale again seven this height look correct no what are we missing do you guys notice the up need oh i notice there you go alright okay so what s going to be your label for your bar graph that s the one going along the bottom the bottom the plant height how high the plant reading are you gonna what are you gonna graph then for your bars hmm what do we always look at when we re thinking about our graphs we always go back to our data table right what are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not seven centimeters for kale you re gonna have to put kale right there i know it s just that was the big plan i think i m on the tail now because okay you have what s this one that was eggplant okay and this is swiss chard yeah well here s that why don t you measure that you haven t measured it yet about five centimeters did you agree walt yeah about five centimeters is that what you got too yeah so why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard and just kale or are we gonna have a graph for both together what would be easier both together i think should we put it together how would we do that how would you merge that i think like both should have their own bar like in the same graph i think so too so which plant do you want to graph today are you gonna do swiss chard or kale they really needed help let s do kale let s look at kale okay what s kale here s the kale which one are we measuring james what did you get for the height for kale seven centimeters okay look see if andrew gets seven yeah about seven okay and what was the height of it last week james so andrew knows it was six centimeters okay it was six centimeters so just put six centimeters here there you go okay so lets fix this let s just make it kale height or grow and then what s this what are you gonna put at the bottom look at your table the height of kale is that gonna go along the bottom how tall it was like in day one and day two let s look what were the labels for our table date and measurement okay so that s what we re going with so the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side do you guys agree james you think that s right okay we ll try it go date and then go ahead and type measurement should we have a unit on it since we re talking about measurement mhmm okay so the whole point of and what s in row one one four 13 okay write that you re gonna put the date there will would you like a turn mhm instead of doing commas if you re gonna write it like that you re gonna put a dash in between i m gonna have will will type this time we ll take turns so type in the date okay and then what would go here under the what are you gonna graph like what s gonna be the bar graph part six centimeters no no the height was the another beam so type that in,0.0
yeah i wanna talk to you some more this is cool that s probably how you attract them is start doing this hey tell me why you think adam he s able to do this again because he has these legs like his legs stick to the ground so i think they can do it because they stick to the ground to get the strength then he pulls it up and he does it again hey that sounds like a connection to what we ve been learning about the structures and the functions yeah so when it s time to start making those connections i really want you to write that down with your team just make sure that that gets on your paper okay i want you writing out how many paper clips is this beetle pulling two grams two grams right now mathematician get busy okay i m gonna keep putting another one on here to make sure put four on there let s see if he can do it with four hey little buddy don t don t don t no no no no pull him away what am i doing he s making a sound he s making a sound he s making a hiss he s making a hissing sound you think why do you think he s hissing maybe because he thinks we re trying to hurt him yeah for self defense yeah alright let me go check in with some other teams you all keep working on your beetle okay what s going on at your all s beetle team he s pulling the beetle is pulling two times its weight two times right now yeah so how many paper clips is that that he s pulling two three three he s pulling three your beetle s not moving you think it s because of the loudness yeah class city class should you be going to other team s beetles i know it s fun and i know it s interesting but should you be going to other team s experiments no ma am you need to be engaged with your team okay we re trying to okay did he pull two he s pulled two and then we re gonna he has pulled two okay so let s see let s just give him a little nudge in the rear when i put a pencil right here he ll go after it oh well see if that works do you think i know like earlier he was trying to get out of the bucket let s see if he can pull it he s doing it he s moving oh my gosh i see he s moving some but i haven t seen the paper clips move yet that s what we have to wait and see are the paper clips going to move wait i have to do my job they re moving they re moving so he just pulled three grams okay so did the beetle pull three grams beth where s your sheet go ahead help talk to each other about what s happening woah you can t hold him you have to leave him on the table wrecking ball somebody pick these up i got it you hold him up good teamwork you hold him up you re hurting him you re hurting him there we go now we ve got four paper clips on there now lets put the paper clips behind him now talk to each other talk to each other i think he s i think he ll be able to pull many many many right now i think the beetle may be able to pull eight eight that s how many we have oh this team over here has eight i might need to go over woah wait wait wait get a green let s see him in action i am noticing that we underestimated our beetles didn t we we underestimated our beetles didn t we yeah our beetles may be able to pull more than we anticipated we can do nine okay not yet not yet keep working mathematicians keep track he s going talk to me team about what s going on he can talk it can pull nine times it pulled eight its body weight it is pulling nine times its body weight wow how many paper clips is nine times its body weight nine grams nine grams holy moly did any of you all predict that this beetle would be able to pull nine grams no we only did all four we only thought four he d pull four we only thought four we only thought four okay are you all making any connections how in the world is this beetle able to pull nine grams of paper clips nine times its body weight what do you think oh now look when it s on the desk is it able to do it no its harder for him to do it on the desk why can t it do it on the desk i think he might have a better grip on the construction paper what grips better what structure is gripping better on that construction paper because it has it s because it s got it s got like suction cups and i guess it s not used to the slippery desk it has claws to pull it it s pulling it i think it looks really it s what abby even though it s really loud in here its still moving it s still moving even though it s loud in here that s right i think it just wants to go to justice you think the beetle s trying to go to justice i don t know about that are you gonna try a tenth paper clip yep yes look look ten ten paperclips let s see he s taking your pencil he s wants to get your pencil oh why do you think because it s wood because he likes wood and what type of animal is the beetle bess betsy beetle but what do they do why do they eat wood they are it s pulling ten why does the bess beetle eat wood look at him i don t know if he s pulling ten or not look at him because he s a decomposer he is a de he is barely pulling ten he s having to work really really hard yeah i think it s probably time to stop adding them to the beetle you think i put max maximum is ten do you think we can add class city class if your beetle is struggling and like arching its back and like flipping its legs but it s barely pulling it it may be time for you to give the beetle we don t wanna be mean to the beetle our max was ten okay so we re left on thank you for taking them off alright class city class yes baby yes put your eyes on me oh i m waiting i m waiting thank you most of us have come to the point where the beetle is struggling okay and having a hard time pulling the weight at this point if your beetle is struggling it is time to start the summarizer and the connector job okay so i wanna hear you talking summarizing connecting what has happened let s give him a rest yeah let s give him wait don t pull that oh my gosh how many is he pulling seven okay here i ll bring you some more where are the rest of your paper clips right there get off he s starting pulling okay oh be nice to my beetle friend i m trying to he keeps on getting his foot stuck to my hand hi little buddy oh i almost touched it we learned before that beetles hang on you re learning that beetles what that beetles are really strong but with their little legs and their thorax maybe their thorax you think is what makes them really strong because the thorax it may be the biggest part in their body yeah it is probably the biggest part what else on their legs what on their legs are helping it their look at it i know what it is their the thing that s sticking to the table and helping it move faster okay so the sticky part on their feet here let me do it yeah okay you all have done a really nice job noticing what structures of this beetle are helping it to be so strong how do you think it uses that in the wild like out in nature how do you think it uses that it s functional and it almost you may even think it s cool but he could use his wings to fly away some beetles do have wings to fly away but what do you think is i need you in your seat nathan what do you think it s using to move its that s a lot of strength its abdomen right okay its abdomen is but in nature what might it use that for it might use it to catch its prey maybe okay what does it what does it do what does it eat it may eat casey say it again to your team organic and it breaks it down it breaks it down what is that called what type of insect would it s a it s a d a d a d a d a d a disposer not a disposer close a decomposer that s it not a disposer but a decomposer good and so okay think it s okay think about if it was trying to dig into the wood of a tree wouldn t it have to be really strong it can make a hole in the wood of the tree that little thing the little might be to decompose the wood so it can bite and then break down it s really gonna have to be biting harder yeah that mouth part is really strong to bite okay so now may i have your attention how many do you have we have 10 you have 10 and it s pulling it let s send him home i want 11 they re moving look at his legs how hard they re trying to pull you might he might be able to pull 11 i m gonna give him one extra no no 12 okay you all keep working on that you re doing a great job thank you i wanna come back to my very first team carrying 10 10 ours can carry 11 yeah it did yeah and he pooped on the paper okay it pooped twice it pooped twice yeah twice okay let me put this here i don t know where to put it there we go so what are you doing are you adding 11 we re gonna see our 11 puller you re gonna do 11 what connections can you make the legs are like a crayfish the legs are like a crayfish yeah how they have joints they re jointed how do you think those joints help that beetle to pull 11 times its body weight the beetle is like a able to grab on yes so tim s saying something say it loud it helps it walk it helps it walk but and escape from predators and escape from predators how because what might it do with those powerful legs what did we notice them doing in their containers they get under the what they get under the rocks and the dirt like tim like when he was on the corner tim was like picking him up and he was holding on to the paper he was holding the paper tim lift him up okay oh yeah it s neat i can make a connection what s your connection if we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk up stairs if we didn t have jointed legs if we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk upstairs right is that what you said coner you re okay you re okay alright i want you talking to each other help halle she s writing down some of your connections help her team help her talk to halle what s another thing the aphid s have pincers and the bess just have tim s telling you something it has little like claws hang on tim s telling you something listen to tim the aphids have pincers and the beetle has these things that helps it eat out the wood they look like little they look like pinchers the beetle has a pincher like a crayfish a pincher like a oh this could pull 11 good connecting keep connecting,0.0
so you re saying here why did you pick it why did you pick the two points that you did okay why are they random no you just tell me why you think those two what okay average okay so i ll come back here in a minute i m gonna tend to this table what okay what is i don t know what i would there cause they have the what is the all right what is and what is you guys it should say what is the slope okay it should say what is the slope it represents the y intercept yeah it said what is the that s what i m saying people all right i m just sayin it would okay three can i have your attention real quick please all right once you find i see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept okay because that ll help you with question number three okay then i ve got through question number three go head and find your answer and here we have what is this linear okay is that a line no okay were you supposed to draw a line through it okay what does it say down there okay why you did number five before you did number one it said draw a line through right this is like a not a line okay a line is straight so you wanna draw a line straight through there but before you do that i want you to answer and do one two three and four first should we erase this uh yeah but don t worry about it right now i want you to work on finding a what two points did you have um okay and why did you get that because what s easy mean like one plus one and what kind of slope did you get oh you haven t done it yet okay i ll get back to you all right but 72 s what s number two what is the slope what is the slope value what is the slope what is the slope and then i was gonna i actually had started out with what doesn t mean in a situation but when you y equals one and x yep okay y 1x now how do we find what s the ordered pair here okay that s the slope intercept form oh that s what got em mixed up so what is it though and you don t have point slope what is the ordered pair for y intercept is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that s like no that s point slope okay i just want the y intercept okay 2 is the y intercept in this equation y mx b right it s two what did that tell me that s what the y intercept is what does it represent the situation okay now wait it s okay is it for two people so is for people okay now if you were to look at your graph which we haven t done yet and where would negative two cross though i m not sure that s now i m also seeing something here about why do you have a two here hello so 30 32 i know right making me erase that s okay so it s three six nine 12 then all this other junk so you can get up there and get 33 always thinkin six is six eight is eight i m sorry three seconds for every how many people for each person three seconds a person okay no that s person according to your data so it took three seconds to pass from the church right now what is minus 24 okay that s a year you have y intercept is negative 24 and it represents okay i want you to do one graph okay yeah whatever your y is starting at by the way this is a they want you to draw a line okay so what is time in seconds right where does the y intercept it crosses x okay it crosses x the y intercept crosses the y intercept crosses y okay the y intercept crosses the y okay so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what okay all right it s crossing talking about time okay it s supposed to say what is the slope the slope is wards for s you should move your line so that it follows the dots okay i m gonna come back here what s the problem time they re confusing me all right so number three you said the y intercept is six elevenths of a second is that what you re saying six elevenths seconds okay and you said that was what okay all right what were the people doing people were passing books so six elevenths okay means that it took six elevenths were no people what was happening during each person to pass so was each person passing the book at six elevenths that s how long it took for them to start passing six elevenths of a second okay so who passed the first globe i mean who s was that angela okay so he did what he had to run around and then to come back and here and turn a person right he had to leave his desk okay now is that an average throw okay what s your average that you re talking about 14 seconds for every 11 men okay so we might wanna just change that to a decimal okay so just find out how many for one person just change it to a decimal and you might wanna change six elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual okay that s great all right that s okay does everybody understand what jade was saying i think the reason why she did that was because we had to make a line okay now okay that doesn t mean make a line graph oh okay are you drawing a straight line a straight line now we just wanna look at what you got here okay what did you put one one and what does it mean i got 1 27672767 okay and what does the slope on the line now don t worry about your line right now just answer these questions what does the slope on the line your slope of one represent in this situation one second per pass okay all right you re gonna do one second per pass averaged per person one second per person to pass the book get back right okay so what does your y intercept represent if it s at zero with no passage that s what the seconds are that s what the point is okay say that again if there s no passes like the time starts at negative two seconds i guess i don t know how to explain did you get a negative yeah now is that possible no no okay why might you have a negative sometimes it drops okay but if you have negative time okay can you she d be like oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago yeah negative no that was three seconds ago but it wasn t so you got a point two right seconds all right now let s just think about and you said it was what negative two seconds but he wrote people okay when was there a time when there was zero people i mean in this situation during the book pass when was there zero time never when it s when okay when they start moving but somebody was moving i think it s zero passes no all right what does your y line represent time in seconds time in seconds so the y intercept rounded out that s what time in seconds right so it s a time when was time when the books were not being passed somebody had to all right walk over and pick em up and then somebody had to walk over and put them,0.0
and why face changes are different at different pressures and so i think that at a certain pressure they re so close together that they aren t a gas anymore and they become a liquid cool because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out and the liquids can still move freely but they re more close together so okay we thought that in a liquid they can t move as freely as it can in gas yeah yeah well another gas has to expand well it does expand to fill its container yeah so does that have anything to do with how they move well you said that some tried to sometimes they don t always expand as much as they can but i think they do my guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is cause you think of pressed gas what are you guys all thinking about of what you re hearing well do things sound reasonable yeah is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas at what point does that matter or not matter uh huh okay we re gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into that s what i want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what you know maybe the book would say beyond just a definition right if you re going down the right path here and you know what that is i see you re making a nice venn diagram here comparing and contrasting that s great what i want you to do is on this sheet here cause this is what you re going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes put down these thoughts these words that you ve got you can even draw your venn diagram on here but explain what that means what does that mean bubbles floating inside the lagoon what does that mean it s escaping off the top when we think of matter what do we actually think of in our heads conceptually we re thinking of a chunk of matter a beaker of liquid so there s some space and what else and what so matter has mass and volume what s matter made up of okay atoms molecules if it helps you you can decide okay let s think of this in terms of water just so it s a known right okay good yeah that s a good way to do that so draw some pictures when you say it s escaping off the top what does that look like okay so try to get it into some visuals okay i ll come back matter like i don t really understand the definition of heat yeah okay so what is heat it s what heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing right so you want to separate what something is from how it behaves so you re saying heat is the transfer of energy transfer is how it behaves right what is it it s just energy it s energy right so heat is a form of energy and you re absolutely right it can move around in the environment between systems in and out of the system so let s say you ve got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it s hot right it s sitting in a cold room what do you expect to happen what will happen to the temperature of the water for example it will okay so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out yeah okay equilibrium good so you understand that heat is energy and you understand that it can move around so the question here is how does adding heat energy for example matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state so not that it does but how so what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter what is matter something with a mass or volume occupies space has mass or volume you know you just said it okay yeah see you know okay matter has volume it takes up space right and it also has what mass the property of mass do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter like if you think of it obviously this is matter right but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things yes okay atoms molecules what would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it remember this isn t rights or wrongs this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this so what if i have two atoms and i add more energy to them what if i have hundreds of atoms and i make them all move faster well i mean that s what i m asking you guys to think about as best you can how would that occur we said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to and they get warmer oh that s the same thing as adding more energy right then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid i would say add some pictures i think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter what it s made of so why don t you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in say something that is changing state maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see as being a series of steps getting it from here to here so start with a lump of solid matter okay something like that take it all the way to a gas okay how do you see that matter okay okay alright let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that start with an atom and build like a box so folks i want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other theorizing is good why don t you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here yep did i take your pencil i m sorry okay we have a pencil thief so you re saying there s some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time water would be evaporating ice would be melting and vapor would be condensing so i just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory how would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under yesterday we talked about some things that affect phase what were they what was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in okay temperature anything else pressure pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature and the matter itself how that would work okay you may need to mentally zoom in on matter what is it what is ice what is water what is gas if you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk what do we see on the inside what s it made up of at a very small level does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules like you can visualize that so bring that in here if you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that try okay okay how s that sound okay a couple more minutes seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this and you re working on presenting it okay how am i supposed to do this oh god i can t draw cups remember you have to explain to everyone what you re drawing s showing so it doesn t have to be perfect oh okay don t worry about perfection you re gonna get to stand up there and say this is what i drew and they just have to believe you okay that s how bad it s gonna be okay so there s like the water i think i have the difference between the molecules okay so that shows that that s gas and liquid what is the big red arrow it s like going up out of the liquid what s it the molecules okay molecules yeah that s what this is supposed to be so the only thing i would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why like why or how what are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you re drawing to happen that s up to you what you think is making i think that s quite good actually that explains it to me really well the things that you think are having an effect on what s actually going to or not going to happen like this amazing flame like that amazing flame so you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that label it f l a m e you ve vibrated those are actually quite good vibrations that s our gas they re awfully close together these are closer together here than they are here is that something that you intended no there supposed to be really spread out it s up to you what you re going to write i m simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together we didn t mean to do that i can draw more what do you think so we ve shown them closer together do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn t matter so they could be closer together they could be closer together as long as they re moving more okay so i think being like spreading out and occupying all space available so if you re thinking that you should include that somehow and it seems like then you and katelyn and ignesia s have different ideas about this and that s important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about what are you doing oh you re adding to it so i hear lindsey s saying that you thought they d be more spread out occupying more space and i hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn t really matter so that s worth thinking about because that s two different ways of looking at this that s two different ways of looking at this anyway we don t need perfection right now we need your initial thoughts but somewhere i d record that discrepancy i would record here that you re still thinking about that issue you think one thing you guys think another that s important so you guys i think i d like to have groups don t worry if you re not totally done i would just like groups to kind of explain what they ve got so far and we re going to go in numerical order so i am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though and give your poster to one group member let s do that now don t worry if it s incomplete this is a work in progress come on back to the tables don t worry if it s not finished you get to explain it and we re gonna keep these around so you can add to them come on back to the tables i count two alright so group one i m gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster you guys let s load towards the front of the room so that we re all closer you don t need all your stuff just come on up and sit a little closer let s squeeze in in all these front tables yeah you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you re thinking was so everybody come on up as close as you can let s squeeze in at these tables let s get a couple people here let s get a couple people here pull a chair on up come on up somebody come sit here somebody sit here so we ve only got a little bit of time left and i want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts you guys may on your pre think sheets take some notes remember this isn t about right or wrong this is about how do we think we understand this system right now and this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit so their question the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state so you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here okay so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point and we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question we were thinking about specific heat the equation for specific heat also we said based on the specific heat of the substance an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount and we thought that was important and it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat so if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree and then a different substance by a different amount and we also thought about how solid liquid and gas that it has to do with the change of space and the solid they re like locked in place but they re still vibrating a little bit then if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid where there s more freedom of movement but they re still sort of contained and then in a gas and in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster and they re not like moving in a certain direction what questions do you guys have for them or comments about what they re thinking why would different materials have different specific heats you don t have to know the answer does anyone have thoughts on that guesses maybe they re different what different types of material i mean substance so i think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different so they can kind of collect heat differently how does that sound to folks reasonable is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances okay so maybe that s something worth looking into as we study this and see why that why that physical property of specific heat why isn t it the same for everything and so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here because you can see that we drew all the molecules really close together compared to the solid and liquid i guess and we weren t sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely and it doesn t matter how spaced out they are as long as they can they re not stuck in one space like solids are they can just move wherever or whether they have to be more spaced out and so didn t occupy the whole space do you guys have thoughts about that what they re saying do you guys understand the point katelyn s making how far do they have to be to be a gas well i think that that s actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure,0.0
right here okay so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is yeah yes because your asymptote is where this would be undefined right so it s gonna be x equals what positive two positive but okay if we put positive two there we have two plus two so it d be negative two negative two that s why we have an asymptote that x equals negative two okay now is there another number out here no no so what would that other number be see there is one here but there s not one here so it d just be zero so it d just be zero so does that tell you what your other asymptote is y equals zero cause f of x stands for that s your y isn t it okay so you can tell by looking at the function itself what your asymptotes are gonna be okay tell me what this asymptote s gonna be your x your vertical asymptote zero zero x equals zero so you re gonna be drawing your asymptote right there what about your y remember how we covered this up and you would have y equals what negative one negative one y plus negative one so the function itself tells you your asymptotes doesn t it okay does that help yeah okay all right so no but it s like that right here though but see she has negative two right here then how did she get the did we write the first one wrong then cause x equals zero no because she got zero and negative two and that s what i got you wrote it down wrong where right here cause zero is supposed to be on top oh so no never mind you got it right it s the same i just switched these around no but you re right because you know how x is vertical okay so for this one it s going to be the x is going to be negative 2 right mm hmm okay i got it so wait the asymptote isn t the same thing as the parent function right no did you have the graph did it turn out and how do you know up here check this thing out huh so what would the parent function be that s what i was trying to work out for you did you find the parent function for what it s not x squared is it one over x all of them is going to be one over x cause you can t just put x she said put a one divided by x that d be the parent function all right how do you know which is the parent function it s the one that s consistent that first one that you put it s the one that s exactly in between the first and third quadrant this is your parent function this is your parent function this one and this one right so blue right there and right there but you totally ruined it yeah yeah the colors i used are kind of weird do you have a red are you using it this is the graph right so if it s the first one and the third one right hey wait that first thingy comes out at negative three not negative two hm this first little line right here comes out negative three not negative two is the parent function still i mean is the asymptote still negative two i think so how is one negative two you gotta switch it because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative so the y would be zero because it s not going to negative how would the y be zero the y is a negative you got em switched all you gotta do is switch em i m not understanding she busy okay oh i know why it s because we don t have no y in the equation like this one it d have a y the y would be negative one and on this one we don t have it so automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two that makes more sense all right you got it yeah i had to think about that so that s how you do it so then the asymptote is the right here uh huh which one so then the translation is the down one wait what the translation is the down one so what is this down let me plug it in divide by x parentheses one over divided by x minus one okay so we don t need no parenthesis no i m almost done you re crossing it that s the y yeah but that s the x this is x and this is y yes well look on the sheet it will show you that um i basically used this one as an example it s like the same type of format that the problem is okay okay yeah that makes sense so the asymptote is zero it says h equals x yeah yeah so zero yeah wait yeah this is the graph you start with yeah that makes more sense cause that s how the graph is okay we got the asymptote x equals is it zero yeah and then y equals negative one and the translation is one unit down do you have a value yeah uh oh so it d be three units down we would put this on negative three cause that s y so since it s y we would have to put it on negative three and zero right cause it s the same as this yeah and then y equals negative three yeah x equals zero and y equals negative three translation three units down wherever the lines like go the furthest but don t touch okay oh you re just marking down the asymptotes yeah she said she forgot yeah so i guess you can just put up there yellow okay are you on number four yes so on number four it would be five units to the left number four yeah yeah you re good okay she just told me she just told i just wrote it wrong i guess then how do you know how to graph it with like in the calculator in here and it s really not good to graph it here yeah okay this seems to be not that hard now that i get it really like remember how grayson thought that it was three i knew she was wrong i mean i didn t think it was wrong you just instinctively knew that it was wrong is it going to have a vertical shift also yep up down down okay up or down down how many two on number five oh three it would be three three okay so you re going to have two shifts on number five right okay uh huh i haven t plugged it in yet we re going to have a shift here right what would make that undefined if x equals how about positive two because two minus two is zero i mean the zero is where you needed to be so x equals two right okay now what are we going to do with this thing out here that s a vertical shift of y equals negative three y equals negative three so we have two translations okay two units right and,0.0
okay so write your conjectures down denominators are repeating actually let s put this one on number four put it on number four we got any even number that had any odd number okay so if it s an odd number in the denominator it s repeating if it s got an even number in the denominator oh okay so you want to add to it not just say it s even if it s odd over even it s terminating it s terminating and what if it s even over even even over even two over six it would one be one over three you d have to simplify it okay you d have to simplify it and so what would happen when you simplified 2 6 to 1 3 it would be repeating it would be repeating so maybe you re on to something might want to record that let s check that s good i haven t heard that one before guys all right let me here some of your conjectures this group we re going with their conjecture what s your conjecture guys that all odd denominator fractions will repeat all right here s the conjecture all odd numbers in the denominator will be repeating decimals anybody want to add to it take away from it change it all right what we got here over here that s false because point two five goes into 100 4 times okay hold on i m confused point two five what is point two five represented as a fraction 1 4 1 4 and they said all odd numbers are repeating so far it works well then 1 5 all right let s try 1 5 well hold on then let s get all the conjectures before we start trying them out i do love the action that you want to make up your own fractions and try it cause i don t think it s safe just to take it at a glance all right dylan what did y all s group george share for your group what did y all say listen guys we had two you had two okay even over odd equals terminating even over odd is terminating okay and even over even is repeating even over even is repeating he meant two by that okay so basically and then i would assume that odd over odd would go here okay my only question is i see even over odd odd over odd even over even what s the other option odd over even odd over even where do you think that would go do you think it would go terminating yes well let s pick something really quick 3 4 that s odd over even that would be terminating okay so opposites even and odd odd and even you re thinking opposites attract there you go opposites attract to be terminating and when they re the same even and even and odd and odd they repel okay and they repeat pretty good here s what i want you to do now based on what you just told me look at number six i ve given you fractions i want you let s look at them as a group i want to come to a consensus as a class do we all agree with this groups thinking we didn t get to share ours because 8 9 repeat okay 8 9 is even over odd and that repeats so maybe we want to cancel this one out and it s just odd over even there might be something else it might be that that doesn t go necessarily doing anything like the rules for divisibility like seven and eight they don t have a rule because it just doesn t work but it s right it might be that that doesn t work maybe if it s even a law you just gotta work it out so do we want to make our rule this if it s odd over eating eating is it time for lunch if it s odd over even it s terminating everything else is repeating we should test it out before 3 4 is terminating but 7 8 isn t terminating cause eight 7 8 try it on your paper real quick 7 8 it terminates so do we want to use this no and yes okay let s let s do more though let s do a democracy here okay if you re liking the well hold on who says no who doesn t want to use this why those rules may not work all the time for every fraction okay so do you have a better rule or conjecture so far is it working based on what we know and the numbers we ve generated so far let s use that rule to categorize the following fractions and i think we could do this as a group so here i ve got our rule we said we wanted to try was odd over even everything else is going in repeating odd over even we ve already done these so here s our new fractions okay what is this fraction here 11 24 it s odd over even so where do we want to put it terminating terminating terminating odd over even would make it terminating six what sevenths 6 7 repeating even over odd terminates but that didn t work that didn t work we tried it and we saw that it didn t work remember yeah odd over even is the only one we re going with so i ve got an odd over even i got odd over odd repeating and i ve got an odd over even terminating okay so here s what i want you to do check it use your calculators as a group check it circle go ahead and write em down categorize them just like i did on the board write em in your chart and circle any that don t belong use your calculator it doesn t work odd over even it doesn t work oh no which one doesn t work seven over six doesn t work all right let s do this then the 6 7 were we correct there all right this one s right no this one was repeating or terminating terminating all right so this one we need to move over here all right 5 13 i haven t checked haven t check that one five divided by 13 we don t know too many decimals okay if it s too many what do you think it s going to be repeating probably going to be repeating so that one looks good let s do this hold on i want you guys to try 11 24 i want you to do 15 14 i want you to check 199 over 200 and i want you all to check nine over 80 these rules already tested out that s terminating the rules weren t tested enough to be proven i think my rule is solid even though it s kind of condensed five four three two one thank you all right 11 24 it stays all right it repeats so it goes over here all right 15 14 repeating all right let me change this though let s change this one to 15 24 check that one and while they re checking point 625 point 625 so it s actually going to terminate okay repeating or terminating terminating it terminated and nine over 80 terminating terminating okay so it didn t work so odd over even doesn t work right it didn t work so let s think about it then we got a do you know a rule i don t know so i m kind of doing this with you let s look at this what is important do you think the numerator is important well if the numerator s what s important i think they re evenly important they re evenly important without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction do you agree he said without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction what do you mean by that you said which one s important if you say the numerator s important then if you change the denominator it might not work so they re not the same fraction without one another okay if the numerator is one less than the denominator then it will be repeating if the numerator is one less than the denominator what about 5 13 that s just one rule there s multiple right well i want to come up with just one rule that works for them all so let s look at this if the numerator is what s important can we not look at these two fractions here what do they both have in common they both have a common denominator and they have different numerators and it s actually put em in two separate categories but they re both odd prime number oh you re seeing something about prime number if it s prime over even it ll be repeating but a prime over an even would be okay so we re gonna do prime over even is which one repeating prime over even is repeating okay because even number has what factor in it automatically two a two and will a prime number have two as a factor a prime number will have two as a factor what are the factors of prime numbers one and itself the only problem with that is the number what two two okay so i think you re on to something if it s prime over even then it ll be repeating prime over even then it s repeating i found a problem with that here s what i want you to do i did 11 over eight 11 over eight it s prime over even okay it is a mix number it s not a mixed number i m sorry it s a improper fraction what would it need to be a mixed number a whole number and a fractional part good job all right so here s my question then here s what i want you to do look up here and i think with fractions we always seem to stress when we re doing equivalent fractions to put a fraction in its what simplest form simplest form anytime there s a prime number it s already going to be in its simplest form right cause you can t reduce it anymore so these are already in their simplest forms what about 15 24 is there a factor that they both have in common three three okay so if i factor out three out of fifteen five i got a five eight so that s an equivalent fraction so i m going to get rid of that odd over even so maybe we could say in a fraction s what simplest form simplest form in a fraction s simplest form if it s odd over even then it what terminates terminates so are we doing a rule that applies to every number every single number so if we were to make a conjecture do we just base it off of six numbers no what i want you to do is i want you as a group to come up with your own example that can either prove this or disprove this conjecture the conjecture is that a fraction in its simplest form if it s odd over even will terminate i want every group to make up their own as a group make up your own example let s do 7 6 you make up your own buck you make up your own you got notebook paper if you want it i made it up so can we do it again no i want a new one they haven t seen so 5 6 5 6 okay try 5 6 is it in simplest form yes okay and so it actually repeats it disproves the theory so it disproves it doesn t it,0.0
do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt do i get a lot now you get what you can t do anything down here you need to help him roll that out he s going to need help right there you can put one in one side and then pull it down through there one right there when in doubt put a button if you re wondering if it should be in there it should be we re a little far apart right here you definitely need to put one right here so it s under reach down right here and put one in this back end going to um wrinkle before you put a nail there can i nail the top part of this yes absolutely because if i your feet need to be on a button regardless on which side you re on you need to be on the button please nail that one right behind you this sun coming out like this makes this felt hot hot and soft and it ll tear easily now this is 30 pound felt it s not 15 pound felt so it s a lot thicker than what you got two common kinds you re going to be putting on okay okay how are we doing over here if you lay it up there the top won t fly down that s right that s good communicate communicate with each other right there did that work out work for you yeah stand this way how many rinds do we need you got your left rind now we need our interval going up to the roof tell us what it is what you need to do on a three tab how far what is our interval here remember can you remember what is it speak up five five five inches okay don t be scared you know it you shout it right out five inches five inches up every five inches be sure to measure from the top of the seam don t measure from here it s got to be from right here measure up five 10 15 20 just go ahead and mark it up you re roof get your layout there and your layout there double check each other check behind each other if the layout s not right and we have to tear shingles back off are those shingles any good no what no sir they re not any good let s make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct remember team work just like on the job anybody can make a mistake you have a couple of eyes on it checking behind that s a lot better you can mark on this side it s not going to hurt a thing you can put a bigger mark on there so you can see it alright something like that okay you can see that that s not small and tiny that s big look at the difference right here enrique my marks and your marks right here you can especially i mean this is relatively new felt this felt gets marked up and scratched up if you put a large crow foot mark on here you re going to know exactly where to hold that thing make sure that you get it where you can see it we re going to cover this stuff right back up now watch this felt as i pull this up and down see those bubbles in it right here i got the bubbles at the top that means i gotta pull it down to get those out you want this stuff laying flat if it doesn t it ll probably show up underneath the machinery if i pull it down too far it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom so you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it i ve got them out and i m just a little bit below my line right here but that s okay it s more important that this is out right here that it s on does that make sense yeah so just make sure now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here don t forget our nailing pattern that we discussed here here here here and here you can feel right here where the plywood is you want to put a button right here and your nail line is going to be right in here on this you don t want to nail into the fascia board you want to come right across in here and put them every six inches and about every two feet right here and one occasionally be careful not to step on the felt step on the buttons so you don t end up sliding just be careful anytime that you re stepping on felt you never want to step on loose felt okay all right go ahead and nail that off this one right here see how you re doing this shingle yeah we re gonna come back with a starter right here turned upside down this right here is gonna have to be cut off so go ahead and just cut this off even that ll be fine right now this one over here don t nail that yet hold on just a second come here a minute you can do it that way that s one way that you can run it down and cut it or right here i can just take this soldier just like this and i can cut it off right here or i can just lap it up there and nail it like it is the other soldier is coming down to right here so just come up here and cut this off got your hook weight on you yeah take and cut one tab off of the shingle flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there it doesn t have to be straight right i just cut it pardon does it have to be straight just eyeball it no it doesn t have to be perfectly straight just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back that ll be fine hold it down there you go never cut back on your handle these right here we ll be able to use for the caps on top so don t throw these away tabs always go in on these so make sure your tab s in flush it up and nail it off once you ve done this you need to pull a layout and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles if we re gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull thirty 36 we re gonna pull 36 inches and we re gonna pull 30 inches top and bottom topping your lines all right does that make sense yeah okay so do that once you nail this off do that and then run your starters you can go ahead and cut that off the inches right here you can go ahead and cut them come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute you got a hook blade y all have it you go ahead and do that then you can do the other side right here go ahead and get your lines snapped put them on there and mark it and pop your lines either way you can do it either way it doesn t matter but since we re gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway flush it up and hang it don t pull that down if you do that s just gonna take and break that shingle off this right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building so we want our finished shingles to come right here also when you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist go ahead and mark that at the top you need to keep them moving you gotta have it marked up there go ahead and mark it up there and mark it right here get these popped and then you can go ahead and get darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y all will be ready to put these things on put your starter on it here thirty and 36 it s raining buttons see that button landed right there y all make sure that you pick these things up when you re done you should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem once they get right here you can t nail it move down the line hammering talk to him what do you want him to do put a nail right there there you go brandon is telling you right y all hold on a minute what does putting a nail right there do i mean you re about to put it right there it holds it center because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up it s gonna hold it right keeps it straight so really you can start putting buttons from down there to here it s not going to affect anything because he s got that button in from this point on we can t put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here he nails it off right but you could nail this go ahead and start doing that working together as a group to get the job done is what it s all about this is not a one man job you can t roll this stuff out and do it by yourself it s not a one person job if you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there s nothing wrong with doing that what you don t want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there watch about cutting back towards your hand like that just be real careful there ya go mike put your hand on that roll for him i got it that may not be enough to cap that ridge off so we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to you need a button in it now he needs help help him right here yes sir where at hold on come on the line right there yeah come on right here is that on right yeah next put the felt right here as far as starting this next row you got a line on thirty six inches you got a line on 36 inches and you ve got a line on 30 inches we want to make sure that when you start this next run that you re not breaking let me see a shingle right here i want you to watch i ve worked on several houses the whole boxing fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house the reason for that was this right here they put their starter on like you re supposed to to allow for the throats of the shingles we have no water penetration down here but once you start this starter tabs up over to your 36 inch line if i laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off i have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt this felt will only hold for so long it s going to get down here it will rot it out and there you re gonna be so you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then give me one more shingle then when you butt this shingle up to this one now what i have is i got my break right here in the center of the full tab and i m six inches away from it that s why our nailing pattern here is important you want to nail above every throat in the far line slightly above in a three tab shingle four nails 1 2 3 4 just like we discussed on the powerpoint above the tar line pardon above the tar line i can t hear you above the tar line it can be in or slightly above most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them your video powerpoint was slightly above but the main important thing here is that you have it to where if you put them in random if i put one right here or in the middle of these two i could possibly have a nail where i got a shingle breaking or i could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that s gonna line up on top of the next one it s important to go here here here and here the purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don t take and blow it up and rip the shingle off so it melts down it ll actually seal and melt down to it all right you re doing good but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut so use a shingle to square it up or your speed square mark your line and cut it straight down right here you can nail it on first that will be fine or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it you see this shingle right here that s got the little slit in it that is exactly six inches is what that is so you can take this shingle right here put your speed square up here take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that either way there s multiple different ways to do it the main thing is don t just take this put it on the 30 inch line nail it down and don t do anything else to it until you get up there y all do it as you go these hot days like this cool that down and it won t get it s form back it ll look bad so we want to keep it looking good all right how we doing good good what about right here you need to put it along the edge if you don t follow along the edge there s three buttons if you started one at the top one at the bottom what s missing one in between so let s get them in there jake you mind getting that one is that going to be enough to roll all this if not we ll get another roll and finish it out just go ahead and run with what you got that ll be okay that will lay down beneath be careful about the top edge of that felt run that y all can stand on this get a couple more buttons in between here we re a little far apart right here i like to see two foot go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button get you a couple more in the middle and then cap that off lay it right down the center,0.0
that s a start ok devon and sasha 3 1 3 what are the classifications natural no not natural rational yes rational real yes ok it s rational and it s real now brian you had first said natural yeah i kinda because a fraction isn t natural ok right a fraction is not natural who else can tell us something about natural numbers then what do we know about our natural numbers they re the counting numbers yeah ok counting numbers what do we mean by that the counting numbers numbers that you count with like one two three ok our natural numbers are our counting numbers so 3 1 3 again was just a rational rational and a real ok very good somebody else ok go ahead natalie square root of 19 what are the classifications rational hold on one second thank you can you show us your number so the square root of 19 ok irrational it s irrational i decided it s irrational cause it s the square root of a nonperfect number nonperfect square nonperfect square ok so sasha and christina both agree that it s irrational and christina what else did you say i m not sure if they heard it s a nonperfect square ok it s not a perfect square and it s also real ok it is irrational and we wanna remember that an irrational number is also a real number even though it doesn t end or repeat how did you know without using your calculator that the square root of 19 was an irrational number it doesn t make a perfect square ok and how do you know it doesn t make a perfect square because i have no idea if you multiply two numbers you don t get it ok very good that s exactly right you actually can multiply two numbers to get 19 it s just a decimal or yeah it s an irrational decimal it s an irrational decimal ok so you can multiply and we looked at an example of that we did a little activity with the square root of 19 is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply to get 19 mm mmm and that s what makes it irrational compared with if you did like the square root of 16 what two numbers can you multiply to get four and four four and four ok good ok how bout another number go ahead the classifications of 1 3 rational and real ok rational real anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1 3 mm hmm the greater the decimal it s repeating right it s a repeating decimal it doesn t end but it does repeat ok so if it were if it was you could get a rational number right and that makes it a rational number very good ok we looked at several numbers how about someone ask a question someone wanna throw in a question ok go ahead scotty what integers are also whole numbers ok what integers and let s make sure everybody s having the opportunity to answer questions repeat that again what integers are also whole numbers ok so what integers are also whole numbers two can be a whole and an integer ok what did you say first two ok two is an example it can be an integer and a whole number positive numbers positive numbers ok our positive numbers negative numbers could be too can negative numbers be whole numbers though no no it can zero ok zero positive numbers ok who remembers what example did i give you when we re thinking about whole numbers pets what can help you think about whole numbers pets ok sasha says pets who can elaborate on what that means the number of pets you have count the number of pets you have and then we asked for a number or something they wouldn t say like i have 3 4 of a dog or something ok so if you d ask somebody how many pets they have their answers are always gonna be what a whole number a whole number which and what are our whole numbers zero one zero to infinity zero through all the way ok mm hmm zero and all alright good good question scotty let s have another question go ahead luke is a negative number rational or irrational ok turn that around so we can see so is a negative number can it be classified as rational or irrational it would be a rational number no a negative number is a rational number it would be both yeah it would be both if you have the square root of a negative number it s an integer take the square root of a negative number an integer is always rational so an integer is rational and a negative number is a is rational but his question let s see that again is a negative number so it could be rational can we have a negative number that s irrational can somebody give me an example of that negative pi ok negative pi mm hmm the negative square root of two ok the negative square root of a number would the negative have to be on the outside or the inside of the pi outside the pi i mean outside the square root sign so luke can you conclude us what was your answer to that question sometimes both ok it can be both mm hmm good alright good question too what about another number what s another number madison go ahead the square root of 144 ok the square root of 144 who can give us the different classifications real ok damian says real natural natural whole whole integer yeah integer any others rational ok it s rational do you agree madison yes ok very good so we looked at when that s if we look at our graphic organizer when it starts here with natural we read this going out that it has all those different classifications good ok how about another number go ahead amy what is the difference between these two numbers the negative square root of nine and the square root of negative nine ok i like that question so what s the difference between those two so on the first example we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign and then we see it on the inside one s real and one s not ok damian says one s real and one s not when it s in the inside it s not real because you can t take the square root of a negative number exactly we cannot take the square root of a negative number so when we see it on the inside there s not a solution to it what about when it s on the outside you can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign ok so what would that answer be negative square root of nine negative three right negative three let s talk a little bit more in depth about when that negative is inside the square root why do we not have a solution to that so it was a square root of negative nine because you can t multiply two numbers to get a negative right exactly so if we had like the square root of nine what two numbers can we multiply to give us three oh nine three and three three and three and remember how we talked about what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number squaring it mm hmm so there s not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine good alright let s have another number go ahead brock ok 3 14 pi i m glad you showed that number 3 14 that is not pi it s rational and real it s irrational no it s rational it s not rational because it never ends or repeats it is rational yeah but 3 14 ends yes it ends it s 3 14 not pi that s not pi pi doesn t end that one ends pi doesn t end ok so are we all in agreement that the number pi is an irrational number that doesn t end or repeat yes but what is brock s number 3 14 3 14 so that number 3 14 ends it ends so what are the classifications for that number rational and real it s rational and real now when we re working problems like area or circumference of a circle why do we use 3 14 because it s easier because it s easier right could we use a whole number for pi to do a calculation no no way it s gonna end right it would never end so when we re doing our calculations we use that 3 14 but brock i m glad you had that number so you know there s that difference pi doesn t end but just 3 14 does end mm hmm square root of negative 41 ok can you show everyone your number so the square root of negative 41 not real ok not a real number but if it was real then and they were on the outside then it d be irrational wouldn t it ok and why would that be irrational the square root of 41 mm hmm no two numbers that can multiply not the same two whole numbers let me ask you a question about the square root of 41 what if your neighbor came and said i d like for you to help me make a fenced in area for my dog and i want it to be a square and i want the area to be 41 how would you maybe respond to your neighbor make it 49 ok cause it wouldn t be a square it wouldn t be a perfect square if it was 41 ok so you what did you say damian to make it like 41 so you could have a seven by or 49 so you could have seven by seven ok good or make it a six by six 36 ok i would tell him to make it way bigger because a dog needs a lot of space no that wouldn t actually be a very big area would it no that would be small unless maybe it was a small dog yes a really small dog like a teacup chihuahua ok how about another question oh ok are repeating decimals ever fractions no yes 1 3 so you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction yeah 1 3 ok 2 6 it s a bunch of threes yes ok 1 3 definitely that was the number damian had a bunch of threes and you said now two what about 2 6 it s repeating also ok cause that will reduce back to what 1 3 1 3 ok alright how about another number ethan square root of two alright i don t know if you can see that but the square root of two what if you try to take the square root of two it s irrational irrational ok it s an irrational number but it s also a real real number good alright another number that we can look at maybe someone who s not answered down here nicole five divided by zero oh that s a good one we ve not had that how about five divided by zero it s not real that s not real ok not a real number again can we go a little bit further why is that not a real number because there s no longer a number you can multiply by it s zero anything divided by zero is not a real number ok i had several of you talking and i do want to hear everyone what did you say natalie it s undefined ok we do say that s undefined michael could you add to that you can t divide anything by zero ok you can t divide anything by zero and if you look on the overhead if i were to write that out and put five inside as our dividend and zero as our divisor is there a number i can multiply by zero to get five no cause anything times zero is zero so that makes it undefined ok very good ok another number ooh ooh ok cliff go ahead and then brock you had your hand raised i ll come back to you the square root of 53 ok hold that up so everyone can see ok we have the square root of 53 classifications for square root of 53 irrational irrational and real and real very good ok brock how about your number ok the square root of a prime number is always what ok brock s given us a question can you repeat that again the square root of a prime number is always what oh that s a very good question irrational ok so if it s a prime number and you re trying to take the square root it s always irrational ethan you said irrational can you expand on that i said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number you have to have two for it to be a perfect square you have to have two numbers prime numbers and you have one and the number itself ok only those two factors right ok very good ok maybe another question mm hmm is a repeating decimal rational or irrational so if it s a repeating decimal rational rational yes ok very good how about another question that we could discuss madison true or false a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats it s false ok it s false what does that mean mariah if it s terminating it so if it terminates it it ends it ends right exactly ok how about another number anyone an example we ve not had many with integers i see you how about one with a negative number anybody have one with a negative number brian you do ok i have the square root of negative 225 not real ok not real again why is that not a real number because it s negative the decimal s inside ok well not the decimal is inside but the negative the negative s inside i wanna throw a number out how about negative 4 5 for the number negative 4 5 rational yeah rational ok it s a rational number and it is a real number is it a negative number yes no yeah no hmmm so negative 4 5 wouldn t that be considered an integer no because it s not a whole or a natural number ok very good what do we know we haven t talked too much about integers what do we know about our integers how do we classify an integer that it s whole numbers and their opposites ok whole numbers and their opposites and we used our number line in class do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line no so what numbers are not considered integers decimals decimals and fractions ok so if they have that negative sign in front of them then what do we call em if they re not integers,0.0
okay so what we re doing is you guys are trying to figure out which one of these invisible tapes yeah is the best so the first thing you gotta do is come up with a nice question for your problem that you want to solve sharonda you wanna share what you ve come up with which tape is the strongest which tape is the strongest okay now see that s good because you don t like we were discussing earlier you don t wanna say which tape is the best because you really don t know what does the best mean strongest stickiest longest lasting but i like it which one s the strongest do you ladies have any ideas i said it was scotch well we were gonna hang the same amount of tape up the edge of the table and stick a marble to the other side and see how long it holds the marble for and that s how you can determine which one is the strongest okay so y all have marbles i have you got some marbles that sounds fine so you re gonna do a sort of a time test which one can last longest okay that might work you might wanna do a little test run tomorrow because if it s something where their gonna sit there the tape s gonna sit there with a marble on it for be able to get that done so you might wanna think about maybe adding marbles to see which one can hold the most or do something to the tape to make it drop the marble i don t know what that might be we re gonna come up with some more creative ideas i was gonna maybe cut like like this tape is cut halfway into it to see how long it will hold with the marble on it oh once it s been cut yeah that would be good okay but and again you have to make sure that you cut each tape the same distance you gotta be fair so what about give me a passionate sample hypothesis that y all came up with if the scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stay on it longer if the scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stick to it longer so in your hypothesis you re mentioning the type of tape and you re mentioning what you re measuring okay i m having trouble finding the group control experimental manipulator okay remember think about your variables think about the especially for your manipulated variable what you re changing between the groups the tape yeah the types of tape i understand okay i ll come back and we ll discuss the other ones alright guys josh sir since y all have already been working a little bit give me a sample question what you re problem is the question that you guys came up with our problem it was which paper towel sucks up more water okay so you absorbs more water absorbs more water or sucks up that s fine we re just nice and simple it means the same thing so you guys are going straight for absorbency yes sir what about a hypothesis darren if brawny bounty and a name brand paper towel are tested then brawny will absorb the most water nice and simple nice and simple see you mentioned all the different brands right in the beginning and then you picked one and said exactly what it would do better absorb the most water okay perfect now have you got any idea how you re gonna test the absorbency any ideas about your procedure what kind of method are you gonna follow to figure out which one absorbs the most water we re gonna use water what do you need with water like water we need water we need water yeah we need water but how are you gonna use the water to test it first we ll get a measurement of how much water we have in a container and then we ll put the towel in the container and see how well it sucks up the water to see if the level drops and we ll measure it from there so you re saying put a known amount of water in some kind of container and we ve got tons of beakers we can use then put the paper towel in there take it out how long you gonna let it sit in there like a minute well you gotta know you gotta come up with the time and it s gotta be right on cause you don t wanna leave bounty in there for 10 seconds but brawny for 40 seconds that s not fair you ve gotta keep it equal but that s the kind of stuff you ve got to think about you ve got to be detailed alright and then you re gonna measure what liquid is left in the container yes you can do that yeah that ll work okay nice and simple so whichever one leaves the least amount of water behind should be the best as far as absorbency yes okay for our procedure we re trying to think and like maybe you could put like three of the same stains on one sock and then test it without one you definitely need to use the same stain you don t wanna have zout going against coffee and clorox fighting mud that s definitely a good idea so what kind of stains might you use we ll use what kind of we got we can use food coloring yeah food coloring i actually have some food coloring or we could use i got some barbecue sauce barbecue sauce as long as you do not eat it during the lab that s fine i like that because that s more natural i mean ketchup and that s already measured for you like in packets that may not be a bad idea or mustard maybe yeah now if you re gonna do those kind of liquids we ll have to find a way to measure it we can use hot sauce or hot sauce okay that works that is more liquidy that might actually work because we can pour it out we can use pipes or you can use pipets or beakers or something to measure it out so that each sock gets the same amount you don t wanna again don t wanna put twice as much hot sauce for this to fight than this one that s not fair yes sir okay what kind of hypothesis our hypothesis was if we test all three samples test all three and then i believe that the clorox will remove the stain faster so you re picking clorox why d you pick that because the clorox is sponsored by more by more varieties of stain removers and they beat so in other words you ve seen commercials about it yes sir so you re taking what you know inferences like we talked about talking about what you know and making a prediction this one seems familiar have you heard of zout no sir okay most people say they haven t i don t know why i picked the same one because that s the only one i d heard of and the reason why we said instead of using a marble which i forgot at home and we used weights but they were way too heavy so we put a glue stick on a piece of each tape that was about 10 centimeters long and we made a cut in it that was one centimeter because one half centimeter was too steep or thick and then we recorded it and we found that the first one that dropped was this one which was a second it didn t hold on at all and then this one was 17 seconds and then scotch proving to be the strongest dropped at 79 seconds 79 seconds alright cool so what does that data then tell you sharonda you said when you collected it what are you looking at what you found out with your data what does it prove that the scotch tape is better and it s not even close so i like how you guys have chosen to use a bar graph because i can just look at it i can just look at it and go wow look at that the bar is up so huge compared to the other two okay so it s very easy to distinguish which one did the best okay did you find maybe ladies that you had any kind of error well yeah the first time i cut into the tape i cut too deep like twice cut too deep yea and then we found out the weights just tore right away they were way too heavy they wouldn t even hold on when i let go so you re very careful about making it drop yeah alright cool okay so what kind of data are you collecting mark i mean what kind of data are you guys trying to put together we trying to figure our which one is stronger which one would last the longest right now we re seeing which one lasts the longest for how many times we rinse it this is the first time we re rinsing it and then we re trying to wipe it up again okay and this is still the this is still corn syrup still the corn syrup okay cool alright that ll work so how are you gonna organize this i ll chart a graph and we re gonna see how which one tears first on which rinse so you re just going straight up by the numbers before it rips kind of simple so that gives you that generates you some numbers to use okay alright michael did you guys i know you re still kind of in the middle of collecting your data anything you see that can be done better something maybe you made an error with something that seems to not be working like you expected dropping this one okay that was one that was one alright anything else maybe that you re noticing with your anything that you re noticing with your procedure that you could to make it this guy could help out a little bit more we could ve put this stuff in a little beaker thing would ve made it easier put what in the beaker our solutions and stuff so we could ve put it in there that way we have an exact measurement that s true okay so what what you re saying is that your experiment may have some errors because you don t really know what s left we got measurments but we don t have exact measurements so you think it would ve been better to do that if you were to do it again that s what you might do okay alright cool carry on okay hi jeff and keosha alright so you re right in the middle of collecting your data do you have a have you come up with a data table yet designed how you want it to look not yet how do you think you want to you gotta make it organized when you put your data in how you gonna write it down any ideas what about a graph well you re definitely gonna have a graph too but you also need a data table to record it now that you re starting to get some results i don t know to do that like okay well we ll just think about it then make something up what do you think will be the easiest way to organize okay let s do this what results are you looking for the best thing stain cleaner okay based on what i mean what are you using as your rule to say that they clean the best color change or yeah okay how much it took off how much it took off how are you gonna measure how much it took off by by the color or do we need to use something i don t know this is up to you guys this is your experiment what do you mean by the color like how dark it went to light from darkest to lightest okay you do that i mean you could compare it side by side that s a good way like a scale sure you got any other ideas you could do that alright so let s just say you went straight up we re gonna compare the original color to the new color how can you organize that into a data table what kind of information would you need to put in there the color yeah the color change okay so the color changed you definitely have to have the brands you ve gotta know which one did what so how are you gonna write down the color change how could you organize that into a chart that s hard i know i know i think you already told me the answer what would you say you were looking for what did you say you were looking for the color change how were you gonna compare it from darkest to lightest from darkest to lightest okay so isn t this sorta like before and after so maybe you can have a somewhere in your data table a column or a row where you re talking about what the color is before describing it so it s gonna be what kind of data since you re describing it what kind of graph should we use we ll get to that in a second so what kind of data is that where you re just writing down like descriptions and colors that s what we ve been working on we re not using numbers well we ll get to the graph in a second you know what kind of data it was where we collect descriptions and colors and words it s right there say it it s you ve got a quantitative well that s numbers qualitative qualitative so that s what you re doing now how you gonna put that in a graph from the darker shade to the lighter shade right decide what goes where okay that sounds good to me what kind of graph i don t know if you re trying to compare and contrast these double bar graph sure that would probably work okay here so you guys have been working on which paper towel absorbs the most liquid i see y all have a data table that nice and simple record how much water they absorb absorb how much water they absorb and what kind of conclusion ms goodwin could you draw for your data for my data i drew that southern homes had absorbed the most water and then brawny absorbed the next absorbed the next most and then it was bounty was the last bounty came in last but only barely only by one so josh yes based on the results that your group got how would you how would that change your thinking in other words how might that change your shopping habits if you had these to choose from well i would pick southern homes more than any of the other brands because it absorbs more and isn t that what it s supposed to do yeah okay so darren looking back at y all s procedure looking back at your entire lab is there anything that maybe if your were to redo this lab right is there something you might would change about it to make it better or more accurate yes i would use different measurements of water like three of them three yes you mean like repeated like maybe for each paper towel do it three times yes okay alright that s actually a pretty good idea because when you do those extra trials it helps to eliminate mistakes because you could ve found out with these two being so close if you would ve had time to be able to do it two more times you could have found that maybe on average bounty ended up beating brawny or vice versa you never know okay mia what about what about your hypothesis was it right did you pick the correct one no i picked brawny brawny okay so what kind of new hypothesis based on this let s say that you guys came up with a whole new idea that was different from what you did this test like another whole procedure like darren was saying do it multiple times maybe it s completely different what kind of new hypothesis would you make if you were gonna do a similar experiment with a twist to it i would pick southern home just because it won this one yeah okay so based on your results you might choose the same one anybody think they would choose a different one i d still stay with the same one which was which one brawny why would you still pick brawny because it was close it wasn t it was like it wasn t that close but if we would ve made like more if we had tested it more then it would ve probably stayed and so do you think it s possible it is possible that if you did a completely different test than just seeing which one sucked up water maybe if you tested strength brawny could have won that one yes i know it could okay cool i like how y all did the lab it was nice and simple and other then darren s error did you see anything that anything else you would do differently anything else that you feel that you could have done better other than just maybe doing it extra times test to see like how thick it is test the thickness of the paper towel yes are you straight so in other words have a second type of test okay sure i ll probably change the temperature of the water change the temperature of it yeah oh that s true so you have to add in different variables because maybe one of them works better under heat or lasts better under higher heat okay cool awesome tim it s okay tim doesn t have to be over here so let s see what kind of chart you have now explain this chart to me deontay because all i m seeing is check marks i did mine i just did something simple okay that s fine i put my name right there and i put if it left a light stain i left a check mark and if it left a dark stain i meant stain i put a check mark okay so i see some of y all are still working on your graphs and how you wanna display them alright so why did you choose a bar graph so we can do like the levels of the stains we got like medium medium light and dark let me see so you saying you re doing you re going kind of like a qualitative data light medium dark and you re just sort of shading up to the level you think that it had okay how could you do that better what might be a more reliable way to gather data i mean the color change is okay i mean the color change is fine because that s what you re looking for right when you buy a stain remover you wanna see that it takes the stain out what might be some more reliable data you could gather if you were to do this differently for the future you need to come up with a creative way to get better data or more data maybe the more data we can get is by looking through the sock up under the sock to see how dark the color went through okay so compare the levels and how much stain was pushed through the sock yes sir alright that ll work what else or we can tell by if it s a light if it s a ring around a light spot then we can tell if it cleared and if it clears some color off of it so you re talking about maybe the shape of the stain or yes sir the shape of the stain okay possibly and if it s a ring around it like this one right here if it s a ring around it it s a light spot and we can tell it isn t t clean enough alright so how about this whose opinions did you use to get these scales i used my own for mine okay cause they think that one was the best and i think this one was the best so what might be think about this what might be a better way a more reliable way to get more data than just your opinions ask other people s opinions ask other people again if you were to redo it do you think it would be a better idea to maybe ask some other people yes like going around the class asking what they think getting a vote like a vote like a survey yeah a survey or a vote okay alright last thing now that you ve finished it what kind of problems did you see is there something that okay if i did this again i know we could ve had some error during this point like we could ve made a mistake here we saw that if we woulda let the colors and the stain remover sit a little longer that it wouldn t have come out,0.0
spanish and you would know if i mean you would know what they re saying because you learn english and you talk you learn english and you know how to talk spanish i agree with you because like because like if they when you said that they had to read write and speak english like they put something that they put something that s english on your paper you d probably understand it more so that s why i agree with you but when they fill out the application what if the application didn t well the application is about like where you re from why are you coming here for like they want to know a lot of information about you i think we should i think we should keep it at one because if you fill out the application you ll know more about people and their birthday and stuff like and then they usually bring them a present okay so it s important to know about somebody now the citizenship board might not go to their birthday party but it is important to know when their birthday is right okay what were you saying ariel i think he must fill out an application because i think you should fill out an application so you can so if you come to america you can if you come to america they ll know when your birthday where did you come from and stuff yeah it s important to have that information why do you think we need to know where they came from because i think they wanted to know where they came from because like if they came from a bad city and they want to come to like a good city and a city or a country a country a country okay if they came from a bad country and they wanted to join a good country then you want to see like they want to see like if they got like if they were bad like where they came from that would be yeah they d have to know that i think i would be because like when they like different countries have different holidays so when they be out like they be out celebrating then nobody won t think nothing s wrong with it because they re celebrating and they don t know that on this day that s when they re celebrating their country i didn t even think about that we need to know about their culture so that we can let them celebrate that s important too great conversation so we re gonna keep that one or get rid of it we re gonna keep it okay so let s move onto the next step and see what you think about the next one that you have to live in the us united states for five years i don t believe that you have to live in the united states for five years because like if you re like i m five years if you re married you re going to have to live for three years but then like the reason why you should live in it five years because like you could get used to the country and everything that s what i think i think that you should live in america for five years if you come from somewhere else because like some people they come here and they see that they don t like it and they try to move back to where they came from and when they try to move back somebody already took their house or something and if they go they ain t gonna have no money to come back because they re just gonna be outside homeless i think there will be some changes to live in the us two years because if you re real old if you re old then they say that you might die in a couple years then if you re staying here if you have to stay here to become a citizen for five years then it takes longer then you wouldn t get the chances to make choices before you die i think you should change you have to live in the us united states for five years because what if if the house is dirty and it s not clean like if it s like the tub still got stains in it explain that a little bit more to me so you said that you would change it to how many years to one year to one year becase if you got in a house that was dirty you might want to do what if the walls was still had stains on it well what would you want to do then move okay where would you move still in the united states or back to your country still in the united states okay so you would still be there so would you want to just stay even though you move from place to place i will do you think you would change the number of years they re gonna be in the united states or just not make them stay in the same place not make them stay in the same place okay so we need to make sure that ariel knows do we have to stay in the same place for all five years no not really no okay i think that if they i think that they should give them at least one year to figure out if they want to stay in that home or go back to where they used to live so i mean if they don t like it on the first day so they won t have to go back again come back to see or come back somebody else at your house at your old house i disagree with you and i agree with you the reason why i disagree with you because they said still living three years just like if you re married and i agree with you because like when you said that they come from the first place i mean the first day they may not like it and they could probably go back where they came from that s why i disagree and agree with you okay i think we should change it so if they look at their choice to go back to their home country for like two months because then they ll miss their family members then like when a couple days in their country and nobody was doing it in america then they could just go back to their country for like a month or something so maybe you guys need to discuss how many years they should stay here in america and maybe if they could how long they could go to visit their relatives in other countries although i think those are all good things to keep discussing so maybe make that decision on how many years and then move onto the next one and i ll come back and see you here but you you trying to become a citizen here but you like want to like you re trying to vote like say if you lived in germany you re trying to go back to germany you can t that s not being loyal to the us because you re trying to become a citizen to the us and you re trying to go back if you was living in germany you re trying to go back to germany what do you think guys well because they have to want to say that a if you don t then they won t have to send you back because you have to be community and jobs so they can get you jobs and what to do and i think that we should keep the rule because say if your old country got in a war you would say you tried to take up them and you re already trying to become a citizen of the usa and you take up for your old country that makes you not become a citizen that don t mean if you re born in your like regular country that don t mean like you can go back go back and forth and take up for them and then when we re having a war you want to take up for us you can t do that you can t like if you grew up in germany you can t take up for germany because you e trying to be a citizen in the us now you can t take up for germany even though you were born there you got to take up for the us do you think that s hard for someone who came to the united states to forget about their old country woudl that be difficult yeah in my opinion i think that d be difficullt because like with me i can make a connection because when i went when i had when i used to live with my grandma me and my momma we used to live with my grandma and i couldn t forget about the things that i did at my grandma s house so my grandma and my cousins but we still were around but i couldn t stop i couldn t forget about what the fun things that we did yeah so what should we put here well i think we should keep it because like you can t go back to your like regular country to do like like you can t fight for the army the army they re trying to stay here to protect us and you re already trying to become a citizen for the us you can t like go back to germany then we should keep that because then so we should learn how to be nice i don t know like we could put so that if like you grew up in germany you can t fight for germany so we re gonna put that okay you have to be true to the us be true to the us how about the next one that says have good moral character is that one that you would keep or get rid of get rid of in my opinion i d get rid of that because people like that s like that s like having like you gotta be like nice to people some people they can t take it like they can t take that they can t like people like i can make a connection because my cousin she got like ups and downs because when people they just like irritate her and they be aggravating her she can t take it no more she just like she just gotta get mad and stuff like people they can t take having a moral character like my cousin she can t do that because people they be like bullying her and stuff and she can t like keep like she can t keep on standing right there and people keep on bullying her brittany do you think we should keep it or leave it i think we should i think we should get rid of it when i was in the suburbs with my godmother she said that my godbrother was getting picked on in school by a bully and he just felt like beating him up what do you think adune well keep it because like why would you let some people get away with most of that stuff you re just gonna let them keep doing the same thing and without the rule without that rule everybody people would just keep getting beat so what i hear all of you saying is that you don t want people to get beaten but you also said that sometimes it s hard to control your anger so you can t you re not always a good person all the time sometimes you make bad choices do you think we could maybe change that rule so that everybody would be happy with it yes i think we should change it to like like when you re like around like older people like elder like older people and like they re real old you can like like you can show like good moral character around them but then when they like go and stuff like when they re not gone like when we was talking about immigrants on the like they was on the boats you don t know what type of people is on the boats it can be like elder people you never know like you can have good moral character around them but like when you like when you re like around your mother don t she want you to respect you don t she want you to respect her but we should change the rule to like sometimes people can just like have a chance to get some people back that really did something really bad to them or caused them to get hurt or something so we should change the rule to like it s kind of like hard for a name but we should think about it i think i have a cause and effect for a good moral character that s why they have like if you have to fill out an application that s why they re trying to like that s why they re trying to like fill out an application to see if you got good moral character or if you re cra,0.0
how much bigger is one than the other it s like a thousand times it s like four times wait those zeros are really skinny well they weren t too bad it s quite a big difference isn t it so is our picture drawn to scale no no can we make judgments on what s happening by our picture no not unless its drawn to scale right rachel how would we redraw that to make it more in line with our numbers which side is bigger the one with the negative okay so we want to make that three times seven to the sixth minus six much smaller right yes would you please redraw make it about a fourth of the size i ll try you can just do a new one don t forget arrow tips please okay now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side okay so do we use our picture to make judgments yeah okay only if it s to scale thank you ma am okay sam you understand that okay alright now one more thing we needed to do for the yeah go ahead that hypotenuse has got a curve it s okay we ll make allowances he doesn t have a straight edge up at the board okay raci what else do we have to do here find the direction find the direction raci how would we go about doing that okay so tangent no that s fine we can use tangent which numbers will we use then okay and pardon me are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now no we well yeah we re going to we just didn t write it that way to solve for theta we would do inverse tangent okay now what do i tell you always to do with this make sure it s in degrees in degrees a couple of you had it in radians that s because in precal we i understand that but so okay now we have the angle is that the angle of the resultant no what would you do jonah 180 add 180 because it s in the third quadrant drew would you agree with that yes because because the resulting forces can t they can t there s no forces in the other quadrants so the resulting force couldn t possibly be in another quadrant okay but how do we measure that angle counter clockwise from east okay good alright any questions sam question i didn t add the 180 but then i put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest that would be fine so you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is alright now do you guys feel better about this problem okay john can you measure that from i said it was i m pretty sure this is incorrect but 12 and a half degrees west of south i mean now that i realize it s yes you could have i guess it s technically the same thing it would have been west of south did i mark it wrong yeah alright well just show it to me later i might have just missed that angle there okay i ll make that correction for you john okay let s go on jonah jake thank you jonah you re going to the board for this one what should i write we can erase all of number one taylor would you please read the problem for us sure a proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640 what does that say newtons over coulombs okay let s stop there for a second hold on don t erase the nanocoulombs you see the difference between an n slash c and a lower case nc sometimes if you re reading too fast you are going to mess those up i do it myself so always take a good look at the units units help inform you what you have okay thank you at some later time its speed is 1 2 times 10 to the second for a you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton for b how long does it take the proton to reach the speed c how far has it moved in an interval and d what is the kinetic energy at the later time okay so connor calling on you again here magnitude of the acceleration how would we go about finding acceleration normally if i just said connor tell me how to find acceleration what s the first stuff that comes to mind f equals m a f equals m a okay or a equals f over m f over m jonah a equals f over m we re working with a proton mass isn t given in the problem but is that going to be an issue for us no no because that s our table of equations so the mass of a proton 1 67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg so we have that part but we don t have the force so rachel how might we find the force isn t the e equals f over q so we can use the charge of the proton to find the to find the charge and what s e it s a constant no no no its not a constant oh isn t it the 640 newtons over coulombs right and what does e represent rachel the electric field electric field good so if we solve this for force what is that going to be f equals okay you can plug numbers in first too that s good jonah can you slow down for some of us please yeah jonah you re not supposed to be looking at your sheet so put your sheet down what did jonah just write up there okay he went too fast so let s back up he plugged in the variables he plugged in the numbers but do we all know where that equation came from green sheet green sheet and e is the electric field good okay and f force q the charge of a proton alright so now do you all know the charge of the proton it s equal to the charge of an electron very good alright now we can find force right what was the force then 6 13 times 10 to the 10th i got 1 02 times 10 to the ninth that s the acceleration oh my bad yeah i was doing acceleration f equals 1 67 1 024 how did i get this problem right oh there it is right there 1 024 x 10 to the negative 16th and that brings up another good point write your work more clearly right because if you can t follow your own how do you expect me or the ap reader to do that so do yourself a favor make sure its clear okay where do we go from here ann back to a equals f over m and we have force and we have mass now right okay now i have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two a john lead your classmates through 2 b okay 2 b you have do you want me to lead the class i want you to ask questions don t tell us i want you to ask questions okay okay so you need to find time so what equation would you use jonah stop using the sheet no i told him he could use it wouldn t it be velocity equals acceleration times time it is yes oh come on jonah don t it s actually v o times x times t not x v o times t that s right isn t it v o times t you are thinking of the equation for displacement oh yeah x times v o well v o is zero because it s from rest alright drew what would you plug in the speed that you re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration oh the speed is 1 2 x 10 to the sixth and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem into that equation and solve it so t equals no john s leading class what does t equal 1 96 times 10 to the negative fifth negative fifth or negative seven five alright sam you lead for part c read part c you lead part c how far has it moved in the interval and if you look up to the problem nope you don t have to look up to the problem you look up to number b which we just did number b yes you do number b and you look at the time that we just found and that s going to be the interval thank you jonah so how are we gonna find time ann or distance sorry distance why d you ask me a question you told me to ask you a question no i didn t alright anyone else know gretchen you look like you know what s the equation to find distance in number c distance equals velocity times time nope that s not what i got but i guess you could do that you could do that no you can t you can t do that why not because i was gonna do that at first gretchen but then i thought in my head that since the object s accelerating the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel i have an equation you have an equation ann i do what is it how about x equals x the original x plus v o times times t plus one half a v squared so what do we know about v o and x o ann that they are just zero so what can we do to both those first parts of the equation just throw them out the window drop it like a bad habit drop it like it s hot so that would be half times acceleration times time squared and conveniently letter a letter a we found the acceleration which was what drew 6 13 x 10 to the 10 nice is just and the time in letter b what was it raci 1 93 times 10 to the negative so if you pound that out on the calc can we just pound it out you cannot just pound it out because you have to do what miranda i don t know put the square in there change back to degrees oh you snuck it in snuck what in the square i don t think i said the square no i didn t but jonah thank you for saying the square for me pound that out in sig fig wise what do you get i got 11 8 11 7 john if acceleration does matter couldn t you also use the equation v t because i also did that and i got the same d equals one write it on the board please d equals what s d i know it works i just don t know how it works i m going to tell you in a second one half v average times t so why will this also work then let s get some of your thoughts ann because if it s the average then it s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just wait a minute it s the average velocity and really the equation is the quantity vo plus v times t yeah that s what i wrote down right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity so wait a minute if the equation is vo plus v then you just get rid of the no yeah you do v plus vo times t the quantity vo plus v times t would just be v average times t okay let s write the whole equation out john one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t then isn t vo plus v just v average so t equals v average times t not v average no yes but vo plus v divided by 2 oh okay i m sorry i see what you mean i missed that yes sorry but it can t just be final velocity okay is there another equation we could ve used i saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked anybody in this class have one of the other ones jonah did you you could do v squared equals 2 a x so another way v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x right good job so you can see there s multiple ways of getting at the same answer right and d letter d i ll have gretchen lead letter d is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time so what equation would you use sam would it be kinetic energy equals times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared yes and then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was 1 67 x 10 27 kilograms thank you for using the unit and then we found the velocity in letter given or it was given right so 1 2 x 10 to the 6th meters per second thank you squared and then you can just plug that into your calculator sig figs 1 2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second meters squared over seconds squared don t forget you have to square the units kilogram meters squared over seconds squared kilograms meters squared over seconds squared yeah what is kilogram meters per second you have to convert the meters i could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something oh momentum that s not what we re looking for though right no it s not no we re good okay now better understanding yes you gotta stay on top of stuff you can t let those distractions get to you okay pass your quizzes to the front face down i ll put them in your files for you do you want to see i ll take yours separate are we allowed to retake them pardon me can we retake them sure thank you you gave me a minus six well i had everything okay now we are starting the next chapter today so i have some handouts to give to you do we have till this friday to retake the last test yeah and quarter ends on friday so anything you guys need,0.0
do you know how to make a u shape like this you re gonna make the u shape with this first it s gonna make a u you re making sod homes what are sod homes tell me what all you know about a sod home there were some homes that were dug out that were built the dugouts were in a hill okay tell me what else you know about sod home okay and why did they use sod to make houses yeah okay so they didn t have trees what kind of land were they on a prairie a prairie and what is a prairie it s a flat kind of land and it never has any trees okay okay would you have wanted to live in a sod home i d choose a log cabin where okay were there any good things about a sod home um yeah what is something good about a sod home okay what are the walls like in a sod home are they thick are they thick walls okay okay did they have any furniture in their sod homes they did why didn t they have furniture jd why didn t they have furniture in their sod homes because they weren t i think abby do you know why they they didn t have furniture in their sod homes no but did they bring their furniture with them no because of the wagon it would take up the whole wagon okay so what did they bring what did they bring hannah a gun they did they brought a gun and food okay so they didn t bring their furniture with them why not why didn t they bring their furniture cause it was too big and it would take up the whole wagon okay okay didn t they have more than one wagon yes that s right a wagon train very good okay i m gonna leave you guys to work and i m gonna be back and check on your sod homes okay it smells very good okay and i ll help you i see that you have trunks why do you have a trunk oh that s very nice to help eli why do you all have trunks because um the pioneers had them the pioneers had trunks why why did they have trunks for their clothes and stuff and toys and toys like we re making the doll okay what were trunks made out of wood wood oh you guys are sharing it s so great thank you so their trunks were made out of wood what kind of homes did they live in sod houses and log homes sod houses and log homes log cabins and log cabins okay that s right that s right and so when they traveled when they left their homes what did they travel in a covered wagon a covered wagon was there just one wagon no they got in a wagon train a wagon train and what was a wagon train it s a bunch of covered wagons oxen in a wagon train in a wagon train would you have wanted to be at the front or the back of the wagon train why i have an idea erase erase erase erase you won t get that dirty you won t get that dirty why would you not get that dirty at the front because they can t move their okay okay what would happen in the wagon train would they take care of each other yeah okay what if a wheel broke off of a wagon they would have to help each other okay okay they would help each other tell me this eli where was the wagon where were the wagons going west they were going west why were they going west cayden they thought they would settle the land okay karev why did the government give them free land okay they were what did they have to do on that land build a house okay build a house that s right that s right so what kind of house did they build a sod house they made a sod house why did they not make a wood house because there weren t a lot of trees on the prairie okay but you said the trunks were made out of wood how did they get trunks made out of wood because they made it before they left they made it before they left that s correct can the doll have long hair you re doing a great job you re just gonna have to imagine that that s right they made their trunks before they left did they just need one trunk no okay twice okay do you know eli can you go show me on the map where the pioneers went on the prairie where the prairie was okay and what is that the prairie the prairie and how do you know it s a prairie because there s no like mountains there how do you know there s no mountains because these are the mountains just like regular colors are not okay and so on the prairie what kind of homes did they build sod houses sod houses so where did they build their log houses at right in this area okay very good and why did they build em there what was there wood a lot of wood good job you can go sit down thank you you did a great job very good job did they take everything with them on the trip why did they not take everything with them okay so when they got there did they have furniture to put into their sod homes no because they just moved in they had just moved in where there good things about a sod home eli what was good about a sod home that s right and what made them that way because the ground is cooler okay the ground is cooler were the log homes good as well yeah okay but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house it s not warm in winter and do you remember when we did a venn diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two yeah so that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through what was the best structure to live in a log cabin a log cabin so that animals couldn t get on top of it and if you lived in a dug out cayden would you if it came a big rain storm would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out back why it s a dryer place isn t it okay you guys continue to work okay tell me what you know about a log house willie tell me something you know about a log house okay they didn t have any air conditioners kennedy you guys are making a log house what are you putting in your log house dolls and some family and some furniture okay did they have a lot of furniture for their log house brody did they have furniture for their log house yeah but when they got there they had to have time to gather up some furniture that s right when they first moved there they didn t have any furniture but eventually they built some didn t they i see you re putting a fireplace in there what did they burn in their fireplace they were burning um buffalo chips they are in a log house they re burning buffalo chips that s right in a sod house they re gonna burn buffalo chips why not wood in a sod house because in a prairie they would run out of if they had enough wood they would build a wood house build a log house that s exactly right were there buffalo chips where there were log houses no why were there not buffalo chips so buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were where did the buffalo live what was it called the prairie the prairie and what is a prairie open grasslands that s exactly right and what are you making dillon a quilt why are you making a quilt tell me why the pioneers needed quilts for to sit on them what else did they do with them willie they on them when they were on their way what else dillon okay did they not have beds yes no they didn t okay that s right okay they had to sleep on the floor are you putting a kitchen in your log house no because they well where did they keep their food at the root cellar where tell me about a root cellar what s a root cellar it s where they kept their frozen food okay was it inside the log cabin or was it outside outside okay and what was the root cellar like okay brody you re exactly right that is great thinking that is great thinking did they keep any food inside their homes yes what d they keep inside their homes flour and sugar flour and sugar and where would they have kept those in what container what kind of container were they barrels that they put them in yeah yeah they were barrels you guys are doing a great job and you re working together and i m gonna come back and check on you in a little bit all right look what i made what is that willie it s what a lantern a lantern why do you have a lantern in your log house okay and so you can see yeah that s right cause they didn t have electricity did they cause they had so they could see to cook good thinking i need to do my little girl okay i ll do the girl,0.0
love the many questions that you re asking asking questions is a great way especially if you re wondering something feel free to ask it even if you go in a little bit different direction also the more you reference the book you can give us some things going on in brave new world and the more specific you can be the better that helps us understand somebody actually connected to the book and maybe how it s connected to them so two things to be thinking about but if you give examples the more specific you can of real world examples also the better off you guys are doing a fantastic job though talking having a natural conversation letting each other speak and all that so continue with the next question are we doing that on here what s that are we doing what we re supposed to in here yeah and my outside people ya ll are doing fine continue with whatever you want to put on here as long as it s related to the conversation obviously ya ll want to talk about bernard john now yeah absolutely alright how do these characters show a variety of ideas about individualism and conformity i ll just kind of start out here s my answer i kind of said that they were like the russians who wanted their blue jeans they knew what they wanted and they kinda went for it and in the end society pretty much pushed them back into their place and was like no don t stand up and rise up against us well i would say i see a similarity between like bernard and john because they both had individual ideals but i definitely that john was a lot stronger in his beliefs than bernard was because i think about how bernard had at first he was all individual and he had these individual beliefs and then when he when they got in trouble kind of in a way all three of them with the uprising and all that kind of stuff he kind of went back on what he was saying and john he stuck to it like he actually did something about it when he actually kind of protested and he was able to go back to being an individual and he went into doing his own thing with his own beliefs so i just feel like john was a lot stronger in what he believed throughout it than bernard who was kind of allowing people to look at him put on him worried about what other people thought about him and all that kind of stuff that s true cuz like whenever bernard was more of i guess a weirdo he does always like question society and why everybody acts the way they do but as soon as he started being popular he started bragging to helmholtz about how like right here it says and i had six girls last week one on monday two on tuesday two more on friday one on saturday so as soon as he became just like everybody else he started to like it far more and it mattered much to him that people like people did what they did like not explicit relationships and everything so you re right john was stronger than bernard i don t think john ever conformed he stuck to his beliefs pretty much the whole time yeah he always stayed an individual like he made sure he didn t conform was helmholtz conformist or individualistic because he did a lot of the same things that you know normal people do but he also read as an idealism at times i think he s somebody who he conformed to what he had to just to get by but at the same time he had his own thoughts and believed what he believed i just don t think he really stood up for what he believed in so we re yeah i think so it s almost like it s almost like a fair weather friend he did what was best for him to keep him going got hit and suffered trouble i feel like i don t know maybe i m crazy but i thought helmholtz was like reminds me of this is stereotypical but he kind of reminds me of like an old professor you know he like just like goes to work helmholtz has like good thoughts about stuff but then he didn t like live the life wasn t he some sort of he was like a top guy professor a psychologist or something he was a scientist alright so kind of sticking on that topic what about the books and how they nobody really read how they kind of all of the books related to i guess individuality and the whole world what life was like before was locked up i can say the same john was reading shakespeare and how shakespeare is all about like love and tragedy and there s like sorrow and there s also you know the aspect of love with romeo juliet and how the people didn t really helmholtz would his job was reading it to them and he started laughing about it because he was trained not to so i think if people actually read about it you know the feelings and how love is supposed to be then people wouldn t go along with how their relationships would be because they d wanna maybe wanna experience falling in love with someone or having that one person would cause a lot more problems with that knowledge along with seeing how people how there s tragedy people are becoming sad and how in the new world people are always supposed to be happy and everyone s getting along then in these stories there s like love conflict and everyone is fighting and it would cause problems because from that people could form their own individual problems and then they start to have their own individuality and form opinions and start asking questions which leads to a lot of things books are they pretty much written to express those emotions in which the whole state is trying to block up anyways that was why they re there so the book do you think that the books are kind of what drove bernard to be a nonconformist and then as he got away from reading and he started conforming back into society what i think happened cuz they were saying i think he was like bipolar or something and everyone else was like something he was shorter than everyone else and i think he was already kind of like put aside cause they were saying that they think he had alcohol given to him as he was a baby so that made him weird so all along he wasn t like everyone else so he wasn t a like no one accepted him for who he was but whenever he got famous or whatever people began to accept him huh he wasn t able to conform is that what you re saying yeah i don t think he was able to conform because no one accepted him for who he was except for helmholtz i think if someone else was in his position like read even like saw a book they probably wouldn t even try to read the way he did they were so used to not i don t know not having books i don t think the same thing would happen to somebody else it kind of reminds me of i don t know if you guys have seen the movie the book of eli how the entire time he s trying to hide the bible because that one guy wants the bible because he wants control over everybody because like if he has like everything in the bible he could like tell people certain things and they would just listen to him so he could be a master like in this book how everybody like the controllers just want control over everybody and without books like i think it s just another type of their control that s a good example also if you think about it present day a lot of people don t even read books anymore they mostly know that they can and you can watch the movies instead there is also technology where you can learn about something without even actually having to read the book so do you think in a way that s kind of like the same way of eliminating how they did in the story and how they eliminate books and there s more technology is like a weakness today you know we re all about technology so we eliminate more books and there s more movies and more technology real quick i wanna throw in one scene that i want you guys to think about also you just brought up a point about if people in the world today saw these books would they even know what to do with them what would they think about them we do have a point in brave new world where someone does see a book that isn t used to seeing these type of books and responds to it when helmholtz looks at the shakespeare that john has so what did you make of helmholtz s response to shakespeare and what do you think that maybe suggests about people s attitudes in the world state especially since the helmholtz would represent i guess an enlightened view point in the world state you remember the scene that i m talking about yeah yeah he started off by laughing at it and didn t later on in the scene he kind of hid the fact that he had read it and that he knew what was going on i m just wondering where it all it s page 183 page 184 says the second paragraph like third or fourth line helmholtz said listen to the scenes of the world first meeting with a puzzled interest i mean i guess being the enlightened thinker helmholtz is kinda curious about it and wanted to know more but at the same time he had that conformity which was kinda scaring him away from it cuz he didn t want to get in trouble i guess he doesn t really seem to understand what s going on in romeo juliet because at the bottom of page 184 same page we saw him laughing about it because he didn t understand why the mother and father are trying to force the daughter on someone she didn t want so i mean it just kind of shows how different things were i guess that goes back to the differences in society between then and now for now and the future like to do the last comments about john or bernard comparing and contrasting i come up with something that didn t really get mentioned john the reason he s an individual is cause he was born he was like literally born and grew up on the reservation bernard the reason he s an individual is because of his physical stature so bernard is an individual because of physically but john is different because of who he is he was born like that so that s what makes they re two different people in individuality standard and that s why i thought that bernard was so easy to go back to conformity because the only thing that made him different was his height and that s why john couldn t because of who he was i thought bernard was the person that john would be if john had been born and raised in his world state where bernard had the only thing that made john different is that he spent so much time on the reservation where everyone s different they value individuality you had some good ideas just to kind of wrap up with that last question something to think about also you guys kind of hit it on this essentially what we have is two characters in bernard and john that both do not fit into their communities right and the world is saying everything is designed to fit exactly and if you don t fit then you re removed from that situation and the savage reservation you are basically shamed out of that group now that s the way john he s trying to interact but because of his mother and because of his birth he is shamed out of it but notice whenever john goes to the world state and bernard takes him and becomes a celebrity because of it all the sudden bernard is very happy to be part of the world state so once bernard can actually conform and gain advantage from that type of society he s more than happy to continue on in it john though being the way he is he s never had the opportunity to conform to any kind of society and he still has that shame culture inside of him that he continues to live by the whole time he s in the world state right so that s something to think about too is not only are they isolated when they are born and different then what happens when all the sudden one of them can conform and can be a valued member of that society which john sort of is but it s more for him being strange and weird and exotic then it is him being a person and being brought into it guys that was a great first half what i need you guys to do in the center circle is go ahead and log in to your computers outside circle people jot down any last minute ideas you want on your paper responses and then in just a minute we ll switch so now we re taking notes as well as having the competition on there correct and did that go ok for outside folks yeah it was ok to do both we can still take notes while we re on the inner circle right oh sure absolutely,0.0
in case you think there s something missing and then we ll see what you got okay the tongue does with the the tongue oh yeah because the trachea will swallow it no the trachea s the air the esophagus close your the esophagus is the food pipe for the thing no the esophagus is the thing that stops the food the esophagus is the food part the windpipe is the trachea you talking about the epiglottis oh the epiglottis that s the flap of skin that stops it food going down your trachea your air passageway so you don t choke right how do you spell that how do you spell what are you gonna put that in there somewhere well here s what i m talking about you only need four people in this group and you don t have as many pieces of paper don t take more without asking why are you taking more why because tyler got on it go wash it in the sink i ll mark down on my clipboard who s having trouble with self control go to the sink and wash it with soap and water all right so you guys do not have the same number of papers that they have at the other table because you only have four people so i m gonna let you add more if you feel that you could add a few more pieces to fill it out more go for it and then i ll check in with y all in just a minute add head yeah but she said it has to be a word what s another word for stomach acid stomach acid acid why don t you put acid that could be anything in your stomach stomach acid s kinda like a compound word well actually since stomach s already here and if we put acid right here you can t just say it s any kind of acid yeah because it s going down the mouth to the throat to the and they have acid in the stomach well that s the intestine duh acid i m gonna stop you right now because we wanna take this to another level but what i have is i have several groups with several different ways of looking at it what seems to be a common thread among some of you is to order things to put them in an order of sequence i had one group that grouped them so what i m asking is that i m still seeing a little bit of food in there and i m still seeing that you ve got processes some people have processes in there and body parts we got lots of body parts so what i m gonna ask you to do is if we could put if we could create a big system on the board with the pieces and if there are duplicates this is why i didn t want you sticking em too much we just put it on top so i m gonna ask you to do this this is gonna be tricky we re not gonna have a lot of time so i m gonna ask you to bring by groups your post its and put them on the board this is our work space so if you think it should be in out five groups four of you think it should be in a linear kind of grouping so we re gonna go with the sequence of events order so what i want you to do is put em on the board and let s look at what you ve got if there s duplicates put it on top if there s something you have that s different figure out where if you can move something can it share a space does it happen at the same time we talked about it over there what three things did you have esophagus throat and neck so they thought those were on equal grounds that they were all either in the same place or the same function i wasn t sure i didn t ask them but they ve got them together so this is gonna be hard it s real easy sitting there with your group of five or six or four people now you ve gotta work with twenty four twenty three okay so we re gonna start with group one and if you can just come stick em on the board and i m gonna get group four next and you ll go up with them so you have to make one picture on this board that shows me how you think they fit if you wanna put them in the same order don t make them touch leave enough room for manipulations yes no pardon the abdomen is the middle the butt is the fleshy part the anus is the actual opening and the rectum is the tube yeah so it s very distinct differences they can t interchange all right so just stick em on and then move quickly got em all right got em on that s why i said they re not going to stick well if you keep sticking them on your face and get the oil from your face all right make sure you agree now you re gonna go up there with your post it notes you may need to use some of their pieces you re welcome to move any of their pieces to fit in since you re coming up there after them and the group that comes after you will be free to move any of your pieces okay all right y all pay attention all right got em all right can you do me a favor and plan before you get up here how you re gonna do it so we can make it move quickly all right guys have a seat now they don t they have some words you don t have so how are you gonna make this work you gonna put yours up above it we re gonna put ours in our order we could fit their s in there there you go however you wanna do it come up and get their voices what s next mouth water where s water i think we need mouth i have teeth tongue then teeth mouth i have taste buds it was tongue teeth then chewing it was tongue then teeth saliva it was saliva saliva chewing i think it was tongue then saliva no it was tongue taste buds saliva teeth then chew and then i think it was esophagus next i have intestine stomach and waste stomach and then intestines and then waste and then kidney no put em on the same all right we put theirs up now teeth intestines i m gonna leave you guys for last over there you have a smaller group i m gonna leave you for last all right all right so health health should be overall i guess it s like yeah yeah you get health from eating proteins go with food no yeah nutrients how are you doing it s kind of hard to put this in the same group with so you were looking linear and now it s hard to go linear because they ve thrown these other things in yeah you have a scrap board what do you do you might wanna build off that s what i m saying or like switching some some of them are very vague and that s exactly it if they re vague you re not quite sure how they tie in you weren t there for their discussion so you don t know what their train of thought was so make it work and realize that somebody s gonna come behind you and they might change it let s put protein and nutrients but health is overall all right this is getting very interesting their strategy you have to realize and i ll make the point while we re waiting for them to finish because they re having their own discussions when you have your discussion with your group your having a discussion with a small group so when you get up there and you see a word and you weren t there for the discussion that brought that word into the list you weren t there you don t know what their thinking was so just like we always say you can t disregard somebody s input because you don t believe it should be there you have to find a way oh i m sorry i m sorry thank you i need you next because y all have the next least amount thank you for catching that you have to make sure that what you do doesn t lose the meaning or change the meaning and doesn t judge somebody else s input you have to just make it work grab it if you know where it goes all right but if by some chance that s what happens when you start stacking we can use this masking tape in little tiny pieces all right go for it ooh are you all right is it still working you re fine yes we re okay you lost a nose we dropped a nose a nose but you see it s ok it may not have stood out in your discussion and you might have brought something to the discussion that they didn t y all gotta talk louder okay nose should be here literally put it right on top of it stomach okay teeth chewing epiglottis esophagus wait esophagus esophagus wait if you have to move something or if you think it needs to be this is the esophagus in other words if you think you have to move something over to fit yours in because it s not there and then intestines and then acid this word s already here so right after the mouth then intestines and then to the kidneys and then to the waste and then health do you wanna move it somewhere else if you think something should be on the same plain i just use the example of scrabble game with them i think saliva i think water and food once you put it into your mouth you re gonna get saliva okay so see what they did so if you feel like you need to move anything we need to get saliva back in there so how s saliva gonna work saliva goes with taste buds and mouth and tongue put it like in the middle okay it should stick wait discuss go ahead tell them what you think it looks like are y all ready are you almost ready no you do know the more that get up there the harder it gets so you re making it harder for us no i m making it harder for them oh all right i m coming got it they have like three on intestines let s put a little piece of tape to hold up the intestines yeah just stick a little piece up at the top it doesn t matter and can you add this to the waste so it doesn t fall all right you guys good okay go all right how are y all doing out there are you watching this unfold yeah and group one i mean three group three you guys look at the task ahead of you it s gotten bigger i need tape all right i m gonna give you a little bit i d like you not to put too much on the board more on the paper you have to figure out if you have a duplicate then just tape it over the top of it anything that s duplicate all right all right i need tape you need tape all right so where do you put stomach all right so he s got a question about where to put stomach no i have stomach acid i m seeing where she s putting stomach it s over here this is acid all right so it s way down there so move down there i need some tape and i will tell you the same thing i told the other two groups think about scrabble so if you have to go in a different direction to make something work you just go in a different direction you make it work okay you guys have the hardest job or it might be the easiest mucus where does the gallbladder go what is that epiligotis oh my bad but look how much came out that s good we didn t have that much expansion on that idea before all we had was body parts can we have tape for two what do you need two pieces of tape all right two pieces of tape all right how we doing emily where do i put mucus mucus goes with the in between the neck thing is that everything all right y all ready would you do me a favor and tell mr dresser we need five more minutes you have a test oh tell him three minutes thank you so we need three minutes you got it okay i think it s good all right ready guys all right have a seat okay now everybody goes up last group take your papers go i need a band aid for what to put over my your what let me look and see if i have one sometimes you have those little bitty ones okay i will look if you need them thank you all right if you re stacking it and it won t stick i have tape here stick your mouth on that mouth this we can put over this can we change this yes use this all right you got it here just put it like that all right how are y all doing what do you have left why don t you alex would you lift up health and move my volcanoes just slide the volcano down it ll come off just slide it down now you can do it that way do you need more tape all right how are we doing in case it doesn t stick got it all right now i want you to while you are waiting and i appreciate the patience that you guys have had i want you to watch and look at what it looks like now because some of you made some significant placements and they ve made some significant changes to that so take a look at what the resulting image is here y all finished wait don t you think this should be over there that s right they get to you have your perspective and they re bringing theirs to it and they had what could have been the hardest part or the easiest part okay i wanna pick up on one thing that you guys said because one of the things that you had when you came here and the group was already had already laid all this out was that they felt strongly that the mouth needed to be here so why because food goes in there paging mrs dalton dalton come in i m sorry hold on try it again like if you re eating something like a hamburger or you re drinking water it s gonna go straight to your mouth and then it goes in there so in the order that we ve established here do you see what they did do you agree with that yeah is it logical yeah ok is there anything else that you placed that you recognize was changed and you wanna know why it was changed or you went oh because i did hear a lot of oh we didn t think of that when you were watching these things go up like at first i thought that that should go before that don t know that i don t know what that is um the glucose water and food okay this column of yes i thought that that should go before the mouth because i was like but don t you put it in don t you put the food in your mouth and they were like yeah but once it enters your body it s not first in the okay using that logic is there anything else that should be adjusted blair uh where the nose is okay what do you think we should do with that you should put the nose right before the mouth or after because it s like you kinda smelled it before you put it in your mouth so would this be logical if i moved this over and put this here like he suggested yes i want to disagree you disagree you re welcome to smelling it is not a part of digesting it at all yeah that s what i said is growling a part of digesting it no it s the way your body reacts to the smell if we use your logic i m not saying remember the way we work things in here is that you can t judge if it s right or wrong you can certainly disagree with it that s true i may disagree but this is your work this is not for me to this is what you re thinking so but using the logic you used growling light headed and dryness in mouth is not a part of digestion but what do these things have in common i saw someone what do these things here have in common they re symptoms of hunger ok so you re calling them symptoms of hunger what else might they be indicators indicators is there another word signals signals if you have stomach growling you feel light headed you have a dryness in your mouth that s a signal right and where does the nose fit in to that and i ll come back to you you have an answer for my question with the nose or you have something else to add like the nose the nose indicates that you re allowed to put food in your mouth and so you prepare with the saliva so you can help break it down so the nose so if you can t smell it s like when you have a cold you can t really taste things okay but does the saliva not flow because you can t smell because you said you need to smell to be able to get the saliva to break it down so if you can t smell if you have a stuffy nose or if you don t have a sense of smell does that stop the saliva no no she said i don t know and that s an okay answer she doesn t know you could have an opinion,0.0
we are now getting into earth sun and moon interactions we have done one thing well we have done several things all year on that first slide which you copied onto your board what is it the moon phases the moon phases you do the moon phases every day so you should be pretty familiar with moon phases what they are how they happen all that good stuff we get to move on okay let s start with something you do know what is a moon phase tom it s what well it s technically when you look up in the sky and like what light you see in the moon good what light you see in the moon where does the light come from the green she s reflecting the sun the sun how does that work the sun shines on the moon and reflects back good the sun shines on the moon and reflects back so that s how we see the moon do you agree with that i see most of you agree good okay then if we know that it comes from the sun why don t you tell me some of the moon phases so we can build on what you just told me what are some of the moon phases this one should be easy waxing crescent waxing crescent excellent aisha waxing gibbous waxing gibbous very good grillen waning crescent waning crescent bailey full moon full moon tom waning gibbous waning gibbous ramos 1st quarter 1st quarter excellent new moon new moon excellent last quarter last quarter third quarter third quarter and last quarter very good when we talked in the last class some of you said second quarter then the second quarter is half time so that would be what moon phase what s halfway in between first and third what moon phase is that full moon yay full moon yay yeah just start spouting everything out and then eventually you ll be right that works for me yeah it s a full moon get it half full or not okay so we have all these moon phases how can you tell which one s which why don t you just look up and say yay it s a fingernail how do you tell which one s which because different moon phases look different how does it look different because it s okay because different parts of the moon have light on it in different amounts okay different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it how would i be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something you re almost almost there yeah i think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces good very good different kinds of faces one lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side which one lights up on the right side the waxing how do you know that because um well you always told us it s light on the right it s wax iting yeah it s light on the right it s wax iting or what you guys like to do wax on wane off or wane off i don t know wax on okay so i don t have a problem i don t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon i think you guys are pretty set on that how about what causes the phases of the moon what makes that happen you ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun but why would you have parts why wouldn t you just be able to see the whole thing all the time sean because the earth blocks out some of the light that s coming from the moon okay good brenda because the earth rotates with time and when the earth rotates the earth blocks the sun so you can see maybe at the top of the moon okay good tom there are other stars shining in different directions not just the sun okay very good stars shining at different directions anything else nancy because the moon is moving and so okay as the moon moves we see different phases so i hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon the sun from reaching the moon are you in agreeance yeah a little bit yeah yeah somewhat okay here s what we re gonna do you have won the experiment you ve done the flip camera but what i want you to do on your table everybody has like a big lollipop you either have the blue styrofoam ball you have the big white styrofoam ball you have a little styrofoam ball i want you each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls okay and then you are going to come this way down in your light paths you are gonna come up front and gather around my lovely light bulb okay come forth children and you might wanna squat down if you re near the front yay i know it s bright good can t see oh you can t see okay alright oh okay what i want you to do and you re already doing it hold it out in front of you i want you to look at your moon what am i holding in my left hand the sun the light bulb the sun you have the moon yay here hold it out in front of you what moon phase do you have on your moon aisha new moon new moon why is it a new moon because you can t see any light you can t see any light i can see lots of light it s blinding me oh there we go but there s a light source isn t my moon illuminated becky it s illuminated on one side but since you re behind it you don t see any of the light coming well then how do i know it s illuminated because you can see other light oh so i look across from me and i see sean sean you have a full moon now you re supposed to disagree with me and tell me that no you don t oh okay um what moon do you have a new moon no you don t you have a full moon he has a waxing moon no he doesn t he has a full moon you all are crazy look it s illuminated on the other side okay oh yeah you could do that but then wouldn t your head be in line with the earth it doesn t make any sense but that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated not that we have 15 different moons or 28 or however many people we have but just because we re looking at a new moon doesn t mean that the moon s not illuminated it s just the other side so i look across and i can see full moon across from me what else can you see from where you re standing tell me what you see and where you see it yes over there with zack and sarah i see fullmoon okay good over there i see a waning gibbous really i see a waxing gibbous uh becky i see a full moon over at zack nice i see a waxing gibbous with charlese i see a full moon well i see a waxing gibbous why why do you see a waxing gibbous and i see a full moon because we re in different places what s that got to do with anything i thought y all told me that we saw moon phases because the earth s shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon how can we see moon phases then tiffany ooo kaitlyn line of sight line of sight what does that mean um besides your sight in a line it s um well because sunlight s here it looks like a new moon but if the sunlight were like over there it wouldn t huh interesting brooke well i m just suspecting that lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then like i couldn t see a shadow i could only see the new moon oh because oh well oh lauren s head is in the way look at if the earth was in the way that if the earth was in the way would that cause a moon phase yeah is the earth in the way of the moon all the time no what could we call sorry what do we call it when we have the earth and the moon and the sun lined up or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the earth or if the earth is blocking light from getting to the moon bailey an eclipse an eclipse have we talked about an eclipse before a little bit just a little bit so is there anything in between me well is there anything between the moon and the sun in my no no vicinty because if i ask you you re gonna be like yeah lauren s head is in the way she s blocking all the light there s nothing in between me and the light source yet all around you re saying you see different moon phases correct mmm hmm mmm hmm i want you to think about that why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball but there s nothing in between us because the moon and the earth is at a different angle ooh cause the earth is at a different angle because of our position your positions very interesting here s what i m willing to have you do you all have a light bulb some work some don t i know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb so you might have to share but i m gonna have you go back to your seats some of you have three people some of you have four people some of you have two daniel you have three now i want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb where you personally can see four different moon phases or three different moon phases depending on how many people are in your group so you need to be able to see if there are four of you four different moon phases you stand there you hold it and if you get it raise your hand for me now okay that was your challenge you don t have to fill anything you don t have to do anything off you go try not to blow it alright move michael where do you think it s gonna be put it like this okay it doesn t have a switch it s just automatically on and off yay we made it nice are we getting there okay okay since you have four people you re going to position yourselves differently than they are they only have three so you re gonna think think about a clock where on the clock will you put everybody so you can all see four different moon phases from your angle well one can go at twelve twelve twelve six and nine and three like a cross do it i don t think we can put anybody over there and then tell me when you get it we can t put anybody over there so that ll be like twelve this ll be like well we need a camera for it right there we re not using a camera okay well now so brenda can stand there brooke can or we can do like um like this kinda way i ll be here she ll be there and she ll be there and you ll be at the corner yeah okay so take your moon it won t move until you stand there and hold it no i see yours new moon no it looks like a waxing excellent ladies and gentlemen i have a group who has it ooo it looks like i have another group who has it ooo i have another group who has it somebody tell me if you equate it to a clock where are you standing tell me what numbers you re standing on jamie uh oh oh forget about that for one moment we had it she s on number one she s sitting at four on a clock she s nine she s three and six and twelve good so one of the ways you can do it is twelve three six nine you can do it that way or you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides what are you moon phases that you have um that s waxing gibbous waxing gibbous there s full moon new moon and this looks like i see full i see new and then if you re at nine and three i should only be able to see half what would those things be mmm go ahead first and third quarter good first and third quarter i want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it okay something besides those four and you got it too okay we could get a and then someone could be could be right there and right there yeah i see a full moon i see a full moon i just see a full moon because your the light source i see a full moon and a i see a full moon i just see a full moon do you see a half moon here i see a full moon well now do you wanna switch out okay i ll take it okay it s blinding ooo yay oh yeah i see a new moon and i like see a everybody got it at least once yep yep okay do me a favor unplug your light bulb and come back to your group okay was there anything in between you well actually your moon and your sun no no so does your theory or your hypothesis that the earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work no carolyn says no tom technically it can work because when you have a i forgot what kinda eclipse it s called but it s an eclipse of the moon it goes like all red or something we had it this year and the arth earth arth the earth is blocking it in a way worse okay so is that going to change the phase of the moon nightly becky no she says no do you agree so what changes the phase of the moon ben the way we see it from earth the way we see it from earth agree yes ah interesting now when you did the experiment before when you did it with a flip camera we re gonna re watch some of those videos i m just gonna do the montage so it s not necessarily gonna be your entire class but we re gonna go through and you need to critique each one you need to figure out do they do something wrong do they do something correct do you need to do something with that do you need to re think your flip camera video because we re gonna do it again after we get finished with this make sense are you sure mmm hmm are you positive mmm hmm let s watch the first one okay let me play it for you again see the phases yeah alright now i want you to tell me besides being blinded what did they do correct what was right they were in a orbit not around the sun just a orbit excellent they were not orbiting around the sun a k a the lightbulb what did they do incorrect they didn t call out the phases okay they didn t call out the phases they didn t orbit orbit the camera they did the camera was in the middle so it went around so that s okay think about that they went around there s even something wrong,0.0
they died because no co2 two snails so if add another plant in there is that going to add co2 or is it going to take away more co2 takeaway you could probably try it with the lights off why do you think that would work umm maybe it might give them some more co2 okay well why don t you write down your predictions so she said turn the lights off and see what happens so did your snail coordinate with your prediction yeah but for long not for long all right haley so look at your prediction this is your setup isaiah can you go shut the door for me okay so number e stay alive stay alive not number letter e it lived okay why do you think but is also in unstable environment i thought plants needed sunlight to live how are they still alive and then they died when when you because there was no light it was light tell me what you said i had no idea wait never mind what do you think it s a miracle it s a miracle why don t you go back to your prior knoweldge here what did we say you didn t answer some of those but what do you think obviously something is making co2 right cause that started at six right if we hit carbon reset look it starts at six and six we re even if i hit play look what s happening what s happening to the co2 level it s getting bigger yeah why is it getting bigger where s that co2 coming from who s making it the plants okay why are they making it so they can live okay what s that called like what process is that when they make co2 photosynthesis photosynthesis makes co2 i guess no isn t it cellular res per tation ms rutala isn t it that respiration you know how we talked about this this is photosynthesis right carbon dioxide plus water in the sun is going to make glucose and oxygen right for respiration they re taking that exact same glucose and that oxygen and they re making three things they re going to make energy to stay alive that s why those plants are still living they re going to make co2 which is why they re still living uh huh and why there s a high number in there and they re also going to make h2o which is water does that make sense do you see now why those numbers are going up for co2 yeah cause they re going through photosynthesis no cause their going through the energy co2 respiration respiration is the process do you see that yeah all right you re welcome all right how are we doing here good you guys are still ready to predict the second part okay how are we doing here we just now got to the back that s okay you take your time this is good take your time as long as you are understanding that s the whole point of this okay so move on to this one what is a new question you have or an experiment you would want to do the snail one well what s the snail one what s a question you have based on what you just did are you curious about something what s a new question or a new experiment you d want to try how come well i just want to know why the snail keeps dying okay you can put that down why does the snail keep dying did it die in every single situaiton though no everyone we ve done so far you might want to think about why which situations it died in right all right let s see put your head up all right you guys are still in this one test tube c2 has plants and snails but resulted in an unstable environment why i thought plants and snails helped each other live why did they die because they didn t have that much what s it called oxygen well when they started the test tube it was at six and six all of them start at six six right so look at test tube c2 to plants two snails the lights are off the o2 level at the end of the experiment is 12 oh oh it s at what zero point zero point zero which means there is no oxygen so does that make sense as to why one of these died the snail was the one the snails died uh huh and then the co2 level is at 12 12 did the plants die no why didn t they die but the snails died because the snails gave off their co2 um hmm and why did that keep the plants alive because they take in co2 uh huh okay but it somehow they didn t give off o2 i guess why is that somehow why weren t they able to give off o2 because the lights weren t on uh huh and why are the lights so important to produce photosynthesis yes they need light for photosynthesis remember this is like a recipe right you have to have all three ingredients to make photosynthesis work you have to have carbon dioxide you have to have water and you have to have sunlight you can t just have one of the three you can t have two of the three you have to have all three do you see why that works okay good um hmm okay good all right how are we doing here we re passing let me ask you yeah i did not she was in the bathroom i went to go blow my nose all right let s go ahead and work over here so let s go ahead and catchup ourselves here what is one new question you have or experiment you would preform so based on what you ve already done is there something you are curious about i just gave you free reign go ahead do whatever you want do you have any questions about anything yeah e stay here yeah i ll stay here while you write it down why do they have to close it up close the test tubes up okay so would you be curious about doing the experiment without closing it that s a good question what was your question every four plants and four snails would they survive with the lights on or off what do you think i think with the lights off because if they have four plants they will have i mean if they had it on they ll produce a lot of oxygen therefore the snails would die but if you put it off maybe they ll produce the right amount of oxygen they ll produce a lot of oxygen the snails will die well it s kind of complicated no i want to try it out you re saying that you think that because it s too much oxygen too much oxygen in this one container maybe well who would benefit from all that oxygen the snails okay so we know the snails would stay alive cause they would have what oxygen okay what about the plants do you think the plants are going to stay alive nope why because they don t have carbon dioxide maybe how s the situation so far good i think it s bad probably it won t survive because so in the light it s okay it s balanced one s giving the other one s getting you got that all right so what do you think is going to happen at night they re going to die probably who s going to die the snails why do you think the snails are going to die i don t know because it s going to be too much co2 too much co2 why is there going to be too much co2 because the snails can t get o2 cause there s no light exactly go ahead and hit play whoa whoa too much co2 did that co2 what did you notice about it and the plants died there was no oxygen there was no oxygen but why did the plants die plants don t need oxygen plants need co2 there was too much they couldn t give off it already was at the max reached it s max here s my question are the snails the only ones making co2 who else is making co2 the plants do plants make co2 at night how could you design a little experiment to test that what can you do to design an experiment right now to test that take all the snails out okay and what okay let s see we want to see if plants will go through respiration at night we re looking for the co2 only what is that a rock okay so look at your data so far what do you notice they re producing a lot of oxygen i m following okay so isn t that weird i thought plants made oxygen i mean they re producing a lot of carbon dioxide they are why are they producing carbon dioxide i thought plants made oxygen wasn t it through respiration okay so they can t get sunlight so they re not going through photosynthesis photosynthesis but they are going through respiration respiration so remember our respiration right they don t have sunlight does respiration need sunlight to work no it needs energy nope it doesn t so all they need is what co2 no what does this stand for glucose right so they need glucose and oxygen was there oxygen in there before we started no there wasn t oh wait yes there was look it s even there was oxygen in there there was six cpms of oxygen so then it went through this process and it made energy which kept them alive it made co2 which you saw because the co2 levels went up up and it also made water h2o which you can t really tell it turned yellow and it s probably still inside the cells does that make sense though okay good all right how are we doing here are we almost done you guys are you getting you re understanding a little okay well let me ask you something do plants go through respiration uh yes how do you know cause they re color it change colors the plants change colors no the water to what color dark blue a dark blue like a darker blue what does dark blue represent let s go back to the beginning part what does dark blue tell you dark blue means that there s what low dark blue means that there s low what okay and you re telling me that respiration sorry that respiration plants go through respiration right uh huh so would there be a low amount of co2 if it goes through respiration no no it will be uh huh so should it be blue yes no no no no it d be yellow uh huh what kind of experiment did you do to show me that plants go through respiration tia plants go through respiration if you cut the lights on and cut the lights off and if you cut the lights on then the water turns blue because it s giving off oxygen cut the lights off they won t go through respiration because they they won t go through respiration no only photosynthesis because there will be no light for them stop give me my paper okay tamara and kelly o please stop and i have a question do you want us to do for our predictions do you want us to do why or why not for both of them or just one even if they re different maybe one of your predictions your plants lived maybe one of your predictions the plants die both of them lived then you can just why do you think both of them lived all right i have a quick question can you guys look over here for a second okay tya over here william over here okay how may of you guys i want a couple people to share their predictions what helped your when you had the three plants that died right most of you were surprised you were like wow how did three plants die with the lights on they had oxygen they had a co2 and they died right so you were surprised what was your prediction what did you set up as an experiment to help them survive what did you predict nacora give me one i put three plants and one snail okay so she said she put three plants one snail how many of you guys did three plants and one snail or a combination of plants and snails okay why did you do that why did you do a combination of plants and snails william because the snails will produce the co2 while the plants would produce the o2 okay so he said the plants would produce o2 the snails would produce co2 what s another option what if i said you know what i m gonna take all your snails good luck keeping those plants alive keyon if i take away all your snails and i said haha you have no snails to keep your plants alive should that be a problem no okay tell me why that wouldn t be a problem why would that not be a problem haley because all you have to do is put three plants in the dark okay how is that going to help you how is putting three plants in the dark she said you can just turn off the lights how would that be helpful because there s more co2 okay more co2 why is there more co2 i would say you can just put them in the light and the dark cause when they re in the light they do photosynthesis and when they re in the dark they do respiration okay she said in the dark they use photosynthesis and in the dark they do respiration isaiah wouldn t you just turn the lights off okay we just said we could turn the lights completely off here s another question do plants go through respiration yes no okay hold on if you said no why are you saying no they don t go through respiration because only animals go through respiration and plants go through photosynthesis okay brandon i want you to set up an experiment for me put one plant put one plant in your test tube and turn the lights off just one plant in the test tube and turn the lights off how many people know what s going to happen one plant in a test tube with the lights off all right look at that okay are the plants alive yes is there more oxygen then co2 no what is there more of co2 how is there more co2 in there it started at six and six why is there more co2 in there respiration because it s not doing photosynthesis because it s not going through photosynthesis but that means that our o2 shouldn t go up why is the co2 going up why is the co2 going up because in the dark the plants breath out co2 okay what is that process of them breathing out their getting rid of co2 what is that process kaleil you kept saying it over and over respiration all right respiration here s another question do plants go through respiration in the day time no photosynthesis what does respiration give you as an animal atp wait atp and i don t want to look no and oxygen no carbon dioxide so respiration gives your carbon dioxide if you look up here look elise respiration gives you carbon dioxide water and energy right do plants when they re going through photosynthesis do they make energy do you see energy in the photosynthesis equation no okay so how do they stay alive during the day do they die during the day and stay alive at night no do they stay alive during the day and die at night no how do they stay alive the whole day long they use the sun s energy they use the what the sun s energy okay and then what do they do with that glucose it just sits there cause glucose isn t energy yet they have to turn into respoiration oh so do they go through respiration during the day yes no they have to or they would die so they make their energy they make glucose but the glucose isn t energy isaiah until they break it down in respiration so do plants have to go through respiration during the day and night yes yes do you go through respiration day and night yes no you don t no do you die at night every time you go to sleep that would be creepy you reproduce every time you go at night no what no you stay alive all day long you stay alive all day long tamara plants stay alive all day long because they go through respiration this is the key respiration the key nikera to getting the glucose for respiration is in photosynthesis photosynthesis this is what keeps everything alive but to get some of the ingredients for this you need to go through this do you see why now we depend on each other ah yes okay understanding so we don t go through photosynthesis just plants do but plants go through both,0.0
well frogs do sink they do it s sinking what do you think caused that to happen what made it sink that time i put it like that and and then it was sinking alright but now we saw some pictures where the real frogs got on lily pads and didn t sink so what do you think is different it s like stuck to the ground and the lily pad is stuck to the ground yeah i think there s something inside i think there s something in like dirt you know like that causes the lily pad to grow but with something in the lily pad seed we were looking at this the other day do you girls remember about that okay what were you all thinking about that they don t but what were you thinking andrea you know these eyes right here we don t have eyes like this but frogs but frogs jump really high if they don t jump really the same they probably just almost jump if the momma and daddy frogs turn into get some eggs and the tadpole comes out that tadpole right there he was following it and then he stopped what if they took the flashlight they might move yeah like this watch when you take it off i did this in my momma s when you take it off and you turn it this way he looks back at it like this that s what he does how come because when tadpoles like eat things that glow then when you take it off you put it back on how come why i know they just don t but that s not fair what else did you notice we did the spots what else did you notice jamal look at it again frog what body parts do you see gray polka dots you said the spots the feet the feet what about it lines on it some lines on it and what are you saying nikera you said it had some things on it that white stuff what is that what is that white stuff on it s feet see if i can get a closer look what is that jamia do you see that the white things on its feet it s his foots it s his feet do you have that on your feet no they need peace and quiet if they don t have a calm river look they live in ponds dude listen listen there are trees right here there s flowers listen latan be quiet i m thinking that this is very calm rivers and this is what you call that ooey gooey stuff that ms robbie called it that s the lake and that s the pond and there i am frogs they need grass they need flowers they need little trees they need i was thinking aleha thinking about us living in houses we live in houses because can t breathe water this is my house and like there s dirt under there and there s dirt under there then under that runs the water the blue water let s add something to it so what made it work this time it stands upside down the frog floats it doesn t jump on any kind of one it only jumps on the ones that are round because it needs something facing up to make the walls because this is facing up so you think maybe the lily pad faces up right if it does this it needs like a shield so the water won t get in because if the water touches it it will tear and it will sink did you listen because they need something on it like rain so you re saying if water touches it what happens if water gets on top of it it ll sink because it ll tear the lily pad up and it ll sink but with the flower on it it does not sink so if it has the flower you think the flower keeps it from sinking because it s stuck it s stuck and it s so hard it makes it so hard and rainy and it dries up so when you dried the frog off did that make a difference well it doesn t make a difference frogs like to be wet frogs are usually wet that frog is an african swimming frog because look at it s feet it does look like an african dwarf frog it jumps on the water it can run and hop on water andrea what did you notice about this what did you notice i know that we have it doesn t float let me show you which one which one what about this one he was growing legs no this one s growing legs but that s what tadpoles swim in okay you see them shine it on it no you see they re moving because they re growing legs if you yell really loud the glass will break and then the tadpoles frogs the frog s body there s a water snake there s a water snake a water snake what are you talking about over here this thing has a frog in it and he just swam okay so we re talking over here ms robbie look so you re comparing the pond to your house yeah alright did you see this that she found out it says the frog is pulling off its skin i wonder why it s doing that because so it can have different skin why would it make different skin it might need different skin because of the way it lives the way it lives it has to take off its own skin just like a snake takes off its whole skin snakes take off their skin be a new frog the way they take off their skin is they shred it off they don t have any arms snakes shed their skin off and they don t have no arms snakes shed their skin yeah do you think frogs shed their skin too what do you think aleha you found the picture tell me what you re thinking let me hear aleha when it gets old they have to take it off he has to take it off why do you think he needs to take his skin off i was thinking just a moment daniel let me hear aleha i can t hear when it gets too rough on him he can take if off maybe if his skin feels rough hmm i m wondering about that that s giving me something to wonder about ms robbie there s a water beetle yes but we re still looking at this about this frog coming off she feels like maybe when his skin is rough he takes it off what did the page say it uses a word i m not sure about molt it said frogs molt a few times every year because it s the way they live it s the way they live but we don t live that way the same way we do we get bigger instead of shredding skin you re right we get what what d you say say that again we get bigger we get bigger and they shred and they shed their skin that s opposite hmm i m going to write down that word molt we re going to talk about that a little bit we re going to try to explore that a little bit more the frogs are underground and they hatch out of the eggs and turn into the tadpoles and they re going to grow up a little and they re going to lost their tail and they re going to turn into an adult frog and then they are underground when it s winter when it s winter they re undergound okay what have you all found out about comparing the frogs protect their babies do the frogs protect their babies no they don t what about your they wait until they hatch they wait till they hatch frogs have bigger eyes than us because they have those eyes like that on their heads and we don t and we have eyes that are small and when you were born did your mom or dad take care of you or your grown up yes i went to my grandma when i m a baby okay did your grownup take care of you when you were a baby andreas yes yeah well what about the mother frogs no i got a lot of food i love you got a lot of food i eat chicken and rice everything andreas just think about our tadpoles is the momma frog in here taking care of those tadpoles no they wait till they hatch maybe the momma frog missed them probably if they die after wintertime,0.0
the yellow has less water that s true and more h plus because a higher concentration of the higher the concentration of the acid yes yes so you think it s something about the acid that s causing the color yeah what about the blue food coloring this stays the same yeah but why would you think this stays the same and it s the acid that s changing color okay so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same but the amount of acid is not so i must be changing the color of the acid so it s the acid that s changing color you re not changing the color of the acid though anybody else got ideas about that that something else that could explain it that s one hypothesis you put the same amount of food coloring in every time right yeah wait so the acid is probably likely to maybe like lose an electron the acid loses electrons what is an acid it gives up an h plus right there are more moles of hydrogen ions right acid s dissociate so i got more molds of h plus in this one okay emma you have an idea well there are more i think i might have gotten it confused basically there s a higher concentration of acid as you go along right so more here yeah there s more when it s lighter lowest most yeah i know okay so that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change then because there are more h pluses if you will that could cause it to jump in energy okay so you got the idea of energy is some kind of something s jumping because you know could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that s changing okay which is why the blue color changes to the like brownish yellow so now what is your idea about what s changing color the orbital the food coloring is changing color the food coloring is changing color yeah the food okay so that makes sense the food coloring is changing color but the acid concentration is making it change color yeah so the food coloring s like the dependent variable right what is in the food coloring that s a good question that s what we need to know what is in the food coloring the same thing that s in the cabbage indicator actually well something similar they re called anthocyanins and i have a little handout to show you what they look like so before we do that though actually no i ll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here so here s an anthocyanin it s this molecule here so usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them okay so what is happening what is causing the different colors so we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping in the food coloring in the food coloring but the food coloring isn t transition metal it s not a transition metal no can you still have that happen well what else could there be well i think it s the o h because is it like splitting up the p orbitals what makes you say that there s like sp 3 orbitals and i guess p2 orbitals okay so are you saying it s that splitting of sp 3 and sp 2 orbitals or the p orbitals i was thinking it s the p orbitals okay so what here would represent the p orbitals whatever bonded with the acid the o h maybe oh would it be the no okay so here s what we re going to do i m going to give you this handout and what i would like you to do i want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color then i want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color okay you should have highlighters by your table purple i ll take green do you want us to do it for all of them yeah let s just do it let s do it for the first one to start with anthocyanins in red wine we ll do that so anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds anything that has color really wine grapes cabbage red onions food coloring are they they re not in colorless though right or are they say it again they can t be colorless because it s colorless well kind of you ll see we ll explain that in a little bit yeah is something colorless because they don t have any d electrons or like the d orbital is filled up with electrons or are there other factors yes that s true for transition metals but for other things for other things that are colorless what would explain why they were colorless it would have to be a different orbital different wave length like the absorption based on the bond yes to both of you so riley s idea is that maybe so what did we say color came from earlier color in general where does color in general come from reflecting certain frequencies and absorbing other frequencies of light right okay so we can only see purple to red so is there another explanation for why something might be colorless because it probably because it s absorbing everything well if it was absorbing everything what color would it be black oh it s not absorbing anything it s not absorbing anything or not absorbing any color it s not absorbing what we can see it s not absorbing what we can see that s right it s not absorbing what we can see it reflects all the colors so you guys see a pattern yet can i borrow somebody s let me borrow yours let s put it under the camera as an example here what do you notice were we supposed to highlight single bonds yes what do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds the double bonds right next to each other the double bonds are next to the single bonds the double bond are next to the single bonds that s right that s right okay in the first one where you have what color is the first one does is say it just says colored red wine but we have colored and we have colorless okay so in the colored one how many can you count how many times it goes double single double single double single that s like a tongue twister it s seven in colored i got seven okay so now count colorless and see what you get what did you guys get for double single i got like 14 okay so are you counting double and single as yeah yeah okay so you basically got seven too okay so do colorless now double bonds between every single bond between the bonds with the c n o i got eight for colored i got 17 in the singles and eight doubles for that okay what s the difference between colored and colorless basically and the number of double and single bonds there are more singles than colorless okay not the total numbers oh wait there s more singles than colorless okay that s a way we can look at it okay see if the same we got seven for colorless okay is it supposed to be the same number no no no it s not supposed to be the same alright let s hear what gracie has to say say what you just said so in colored there s more doubles and there s less singles so that means that there s going to be more of the single doubles but then in colorless there s less doubles and more singles so that means there s less single doubles can somebody restate that just so that i can make sure that you understand what she said does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are that colors so say it again when there are more double bonds there s a color or something okay when there s more double bonds there s a color does that seem like the pattern we re noticing here it has to do with pi bonding why does it have to do with pi bonding because it s an overlap of p orbitals overlap of p orbitals which allows the delocalized electrons to like okay so what did you say con delocalization delocalization the delocalization comes from pi bonds what is a pi bond it s the overlap of what p orbitals p orbitals p orbitals okay so when it goes double single double single double single what s happening there how does that create it s like one big pi bond like when you have like earlier you were talking about whatcha ma call its i can t articulate delocalization no like one giant p orbital yeah like sort of yeah one giant p orbital like one giant pi bond it like expands from like through different oh and like a benzene shape and then that makes a circle yeah and it s not actually like here s one here s one pi bond here s one pi bond here s one it s like they re like all pi bonded they re like all pi bonded to each other okay so in which case in which case are they all pi bonded to each other the colored form or the colorless form i d say colored because they are all close to each other like the pi bonds the pi bonds say it again they re close to each other they re close to each other in the colored form so is there more there s more double bonds there s more double bonds in the colored yeah so they would have to be closer to each other there are more double bonds in colored less double bonds in colorless okay so how many of you say there s less double bonds in the colorless less double bonds in the colorless three there s only seven double bonds in colorless and there s eight in colored and there s more leftover singles wait for which one for colored oh you re counting the far left one yeah this one has eight this is an intermediate one so then it s seven and seven seven and seven okay so how many if you were to try to connect so the idea is that it makes one giant p orbital if you were going to connect all of the p orbitals which one would have the most gigantic p orbital colored colored is that clear to everybody why did you say colorless did you say colorless yeah i don t understand why because there s a bunch of single bonds because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things wait for the far left does that make any sense we re talking about the far left one let s look at all three so which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond the middle one the middle one because it s an intermediate and they re more double bonds does anyone disagree that it s going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p orbital okay alright let s look at some more down here did you guys do does somebody have these highlighted no i think rebecca you have them highlighted right okay so let s look at these two here can we apply our hypothesis so what is our hypothesis by the way more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is okay the more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is that s our hypothesis is it supported by these two on the side here can we highlight the exterior so what do you think is our hypothosis supported by these two alright con can you explain well i mean it just looks like there s a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double single is kind of broken okay right so there s a streak of double single double single double single double single double single so imagine you start somewhere have you guys ever heard the song that never ends yes this is the song that never ends okay we re not gonna sing it it never ends so in this case if we were to just go around going double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single would i ever get to an end necessarily would i here how about if i went double still single double single double single double single but that s single single single single so which one s going to have a more extensive pi bond the top one so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is the more colored it is okay so what causes color in these compounds shared electrons more shared electrons that are shared how pi bonds more pi bonds equals what more area for the electrons to move around okay more area for them more delocalization okay so let s take it back to this to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration why are these different colors what is happening here let s put this together oh is it the h is taking more of the delocalized electrons because h is positive what do you think because there s a higher concentration so say it again okay so since h is a positive ion it takes more of the since there s more it takes more of the delocalized electrons okay so it s taking more of the delocalized electrons so how does that explain the color change can somebody add onto that there s less electrons so i guess there s less more double bonding there s less energy absorbed no there s increased so is more energy being absorbed or less energy being absorbed when it s yellow more energy is being absorbed that s why it s yellow exactly that creates further because there are more electrons bonding with the h plus than there is in the it s about absorption ah okay ruth say that,0.0
okay would the person who is currently writing please stand up alright nice and loud what did you guys put and why nicholas carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict to create the perfect amount of work okay very good john nice and loud marie curie okay discovered that radiation okay what about you guys alright two claps for these neighbors sit down pass the board one person what would be this is an opinion question what do you think would be the result if scientists didn t communicate their findings to the community at large go do we need to write this down on the board just give a bullet sentence do we have to pick a scientist for this one to prove it nope this is just an opinion just give me like a one word bullet would be fine okay pass the board one person and would that person please stand up troy what did you guys have there would be multiple theories on how things worked society would be stagnant and newton s hypothesis newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff and he didn t think it was important so when he found out a few months before that he didn t publish it until they asked him about it and then he republished to them so they could hang out with everybody else okay excellent what do you guys have there would be no uniform units therefore there would be no real way to judge one s discovery and you couldn t really bounce one idea off another okay what d you guys have we said that we wouldn t have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done because i know that celsius went off of newton s ideas of how the poles were flat and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were okay very good alright two claps for all our neighbors pass the board one person okay i like this one if you could interview any of the scientists that we ve looked at today who would it be and what one question would you be sure to ask okay go okay stop right there pass the board one person please stand up please stand up who s going from this group andy super okay nice and loud let s use active listening john who would you guys pick and what question would you ask marie curie i said it right and what question would you ask dear if she got any oppression from the male scientists okay the oppression from the male scientists i like it what about you guys we would ask thomas edison what inspired you to create the phonograph excellent okay back there who would you pick and what we were also going to ask thomas edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs of the light bulb specifically okay brandon we had albert einstein and our question would be how did he come up with all his theories if he couldn t pass high school math okay what d you guys put we picked oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this if he realized what he actually made you probably can t see it but they have written on the board the manhattan project okay very good and you guys oppenheimer what his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb okay this is a really great segway to what we re going to do next big claps for all these guys please move into your catwalk formation find a partner go in ten without the boards just yourself just your bodies nine eight seven six five oh we have a partner whose hand is up four looks like there we go three two one be sure to oh we need a real quick hands up don t we hand ripple establish who your partner is wow that was emphatic okay be sure you re using active listening because i will quiz you here s your question how are scientists affected by social issues social issues going on in our culture how does that affect what scientists can and can t do or what they think the person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back go when you re done stand back to back okay face me since this one is kind of a shifting gears one i want to let you volunteer did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave yeah interference from the church okay definitely a social issue if they don t have their research believed they could not receive funding or just get shunned basically if it disagrees with what the society basically believes in okay so you could be shunned you could risk your political or your religious beliefs em problems with morality like testing on animals okay did you guys want to add something down there no no you re good they said what we said basically okay this question is for the other partner why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world think for a few seconds why do scientists try to understand the natural world okay give your answer then stand back to back go okay face me i m going to let you guys volunteer on this one too who had a partner with a really good answer yeah it s just human nature to question things okay very good since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it we just question okay what d you guys have because they re extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do okay so we re very curious creatures how to make things in everyday life easier ooooh that segways to my next question split apart brody take the catwalk logan take the catwalk hey you guys were my first ones last time too aw such love i was the first one last time were you yeah oh i just remember those two catwalking together okay shift us down two super shift down two and a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand super okay the person who has ordered the most id badges this year is going to answer the following question shh here s your question five four three two thank you here s your question what motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs what motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs think about it go okay split apart i m just going to randomly popcorn on this one brandon what d you guys say we came up with make life easier okay to make life easier alright what s something you guys said money and power money and power interesting what s something you guys said to decrease death like medical science okay so let people live longer probably also live more quality lives excellent okay take the catwalk take the catwalk shift down two partners once she gets down there shift down two super and a quick hands up hands hands hands hands hands uh oh there we go hands hands hands hands hands hands hands now everybody take three steps that way one two three super okay this time the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question what evidence can you cite from today s scientists that we ve discussed where something microscopic something you can t see was being sensed or manipulated what is an example of the scientists we learned today hold on just one sec what is an example of something the scientists we learned about today hold on hold on hold on i had a request to restate the question what is an example from the scientists we learned about today using sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can t be seen okay now go we certainly cannot see that except on the macroscopic level we can see the results of it brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster so brandon what was your answer i found on thomas edison found radio waves okay very good face me please emily what s something you guys talked about marie curie found radiation from atoms okay very good erin what s something you guys talked about okay very good take the catwalk take the catwalk on the catwalk alright pg pg pg thank you scooch down and hands up hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands hands super okay the person whose last digit in their address is the lowest is going to answer this question okay here is your question we talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world what is your opinion of scientists manipulating using for our benefit our natural world okay go okay face me nice and loud so everyone can hear brian what did your group discuss we thought it all depended on humanism how they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world that they feel like they re higher than all the other creatures then they can do what they want to the natural world okay so as long as it s being used for good i guess okay with the benefit of humans or the world in general kind of a socialist view the world in general okay john what did you guys say yeah what did we say pretty much the same thing the same thing pretty much okay so are you specifically looking at human needs or more global human okay what about you guys what did you partnership talk about that it was okay to a point there was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world like taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another okay so who should decide what those points are i don t know okay alright that segways us to the next question if you were let s see let s do this the person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question okay if you were the scientific consultant to president barack obama what percentage of our national budget should be spent on science and why justify that amount go it s a percentage so we re not talking a dollar amount what percentage well it doesn t really matter do you think half of our budget do you think a third of our budget you think a quarter of our budget i don t know you could delineate that okay i could tell by looking at you guys that we ve got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this so spread back apart and face me what did you guys say well i said that 15 is a good amount because then it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need okay now you guys had a very specific take on it what did you guys talk about we talked about if medical if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences as well as it should and if it is then the percentage should be increased to help like 50 to 60 if medical is included okay so we have to look at the different kinds of research are we just studying stuff to study stuff are we developing a technology that will help human need are we looking at medical alright very good take the catwalk take the catwalk on the catwalk they do their little turns on the catwalk on the catwalk okay of the science of the person we haven t scooted oh scoot down i m out of order thank you scoot down i got so excited about the questions scoot down scoot down we will okay here we go we re creatures of habit sometimes hands up real fast make sure you ve got the right partner uh huh uh huh uh huh there we go okay the person whose third no the person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest,0.0
okay so for social needs we said that their social needs are being met because they they look like the slave traders can talk to each other because they speak the same language but the slaves don t so their social needs with each other aren t so you feel your social needs are being met yeah and how so because our person can talk to cause you have people to talk to don t you yeah anybody agree with that i agree because our person you i am you re that person don t say my person cause that s you i can talk to other people so you do have some social interaction so there s some disagreement there as social needs are being met or not no hands nita jump in we cannot so your social needs are not being met yes our social needs are not being met because we they do not understand each other meaning like deaf or they cannot talk so how does that make you feel go ahead and talk about your emotional needs now being met or not being met our emotional needs are not being met right now i think i disagree i think ours are kind of being met i agree with lauren s ours are being met because they re more happy that they re gonna get a lot of money you re the person but our person is kinda serious like he doesn t really want so as far as what nita s already talked about emotionally so are your emotional needs being met he looks angry you feel safe you re good to go yeah cause we know we re she s like i don t really want to go but they want the money but we want money we want all the money well it s the physical needs anyway ours ours are not being met ours are being met cause we get weapons and everything all good food i agree and ours are also being met you don t want to mess with them yeah i disagree with both of you guys because ours are not being met at all definitely not we are like we re starving starving my needs are not being met if i m ashley because i m scrunched together i m uncomfortable my physical needs aren t being met because it s crowded and my muscles ache does anyone agree with that that their physical needs are not being met i agree that ashley s physical needs aren t being met because they are scrunched together and it looks like they re in chains and they don t have much are your physical needs being met yes our physical needs are being met because i disagree with you because i think you have space our physical needs are being met we re not like you re in good shape with your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs how do those kind of all go together talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel based on this picture you re that person so use first person point of view and discuss how those are all intertwined and then add to your conversation as far as i know some of you did the bottom two as far as not these are what are being met and these are not being met so make sure you cover those two okay how they all intertwine or if they do and then you can discuss these bottom questions too even if you didn t get to them with your partner jump in now with each other i ll be right back alright so my emotional needs are being met i m earning the money that i should be and i feel confident all of our emotional needs all of our needs are being met why are the clothes taken off and why are the just in case emotional needs are not they do jump overboard being met it looks like they re sad because because we look depressed and you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like our faces and their and our body language and there was and we re scared because we see the weapons and we don t know what they re gonna do with it to us so think about the cause and effect of that our emotional kinda was being met are the people standing up no but how are they not chained still all of our emotional needs are being met they re running away they don t look worried they look kind of like they re looking at the scenery kind of they look calm in their expression they look calm yeah they don t look worried or anything these people but the people that are sitting down i disagree with alan cause they look calm and confident i kinda disagree with that because they look like that s why they re all facing different directions they re watching for anything suspicious they re all looking in different directions they aren t smiling like they re looking at beautiful scenery there s like little sections in between so like grayson said if they do jump overboard they don t all fall over and tip the boat do you think these people are all in one group no let me rewind and say my question again do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had do you understand my question i m not saying it very well were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group yeah you think so how were the roles different i think there s bosses and then there was slaves like slave traders and them kind of serious like they just got their reward and these people they look kind of like chained i don t think they re running away i think they re running away i think they re going to a bigger boat cause these people look like i think they re like that s not the full canoe and they re just taking the slaves to the big boat so let me say my question again let me say my question again why would slaves take slaves they re slave traders they re not slaves how do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders let me say my question again i want you to think about your role and what was just said do you think that all roles that i gave this group were i m sorry are on this picture no oh you re changing your mind discuss that at first you said yes discuss that why maybe not all the roles that i gave you were on this picture no do not say your role yet ladies and gentlemen we have about one minute i think that they are people in the tribe and they re giving their slaves as slaves you know how we were doing that worksheet the graphic organizer it said that most of the time they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones well i think cause they could still have their own slaves i think this is a slave trader well not really like a slave trader but like cause the slave traders a slave boss kind of were from england so i think they d have white skin i think they re with the other people but remember african americans were also slave traders because they re not chained and they re standing and the other people like slaves are all tucked together and depressed i think that some european traders tried to persuade other slave people to say like go get your crime people go get your crime people slaves yeah your slaves in your own tribe and then we ll trade you gold a bag of tobacco and those helped capture so even though they don t have white skin they might be slave traders and they give like so we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders is that what i m hearing you say one being they could have also been threatened to work europeans hold that thought david one being europeans and one being african well not really african american cause in the book it said that the african slaves not the european slaves but the african slaves their slaves were kinda like maids so i want you to think about the role that you were given and i asked you to look at that picture from that perspective is it possible that that specific role i gave you has many different perspectives itself yes alright i want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add and then we re gonna continue tomorrow you re not gonna tell not yet no i changed my mind you think you know you think you know we still have the cards aw rats they did it,0.0

just one time for a little pronunciation practice thus thus therefore therefore consequence three syllables con se quence consequence all right good good and the fact is and the fact is these are pretty much words we re gonna use in writing only we don t really speak these words not often very rare these we used in speaking since because and so and these are the words you re gonna be using today you re gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships these are more when you re writing an essay an essay like maybe for the ela or when you re writing an academic essay okay so we have one more you guys are doing so great and i have a lot of stuff here i have a one two three scarf say it with me scarf scarf what about that f on the end scarf

five four three two one stop i m going to follow the same norms you are so if i want to talk i m going to have to raise my hand does anybody want to start us off sort of an initial response or something that s been on your mind or a place we can go in the play to start this conversation in the last act when emilia and iago or iago s been caught and emilia is piecing together all of these things that iago s done how it all works and she s telling the others around him what he s done he keeps telling her be quiet this isn t your place to talk you shouldn t be here but whereas most stereotypical women would have just kind of followed what their husband wanted and just you know kind of been in the background emilia actually stands up and says what she thinks is right yeah okay what also talked about was how desdemona kind of juxtaposes that in that she s like the very stereotypical housewife to the point at which she refuses to even like blame her husband for killing her so we kind of it s interesting how those two characters are just to touch on the racism part i would have to say it s not and at least if it is that isn t the main focus of the play i d say that it s focused more on these complex characters and their web of lies and the plot itself isn t focused on if it is i think because i don t really think it is i kind of agree with chloe i don t think that othello is a racist or sexist play it does have racism and sexism in it but that s because it was written by william shakespeare in a time when that was the norm you can t really look at it as a modern person because we think of racism and sexism so differently from the audience it was intended for they thought of it as more of the norm so it does seem more normal like it seemed believable and normal to them because that s just how their society was then it also kind of looks at like how racism sort of caused it like iago hates othello and one reason that he gives is that he s black and he doesn t deserve his position and he kind of uses race to his advantage to do bad things so it s kind of looking at it s not racist it s looking at racism and sexism and saying like how they can be used and manipulated you know yeah i kind of agree with you i think this play is really about like taking advantage of people any way you can so like if you have something on them like they re a different color or if they re a different sex then you can use that to your advantage by like putting that as an excuse almost to take advantage let s return to that raise your hand if iago was your favorite character in this class come on i mean this is a i have to say i agree i would raise my hand to that question which i find troubling because i certainly agree with some of the opinions that i m hearing here that we have this interesting contrast between emilia and desdemona as two different ways women can live with male violence and we also have this examination of how racism and sexism are used as part of the plot to take down othello but at the same time i have to say i think that it feels to me like the play is set up for us like iago more iago talks to us he lets us into his world into his mind in a way that nobody else does so i d almost feel like we can t blame ourselves as the audience for identifying with him for secretly making part of us rooting for him or he even made me sort like glorying in his intelligence and his capacity for manipulation and just his power and i wonder what we do with that because if you walk away from this play being like i love iago then aren t you also kind of saying in a way celebrating what he s done do you agree with me disagree with me i think his ability to like his like logic and how he like plans things like how he like manipulates a lot of situations and how he like schemes to like use people s like baggage i guess to his advantage is kind of like i guess like the way he uses it isn t a good way but like if you could use it in a different way i guess it like could be viewed as like a good thing so i think there s a difference between like celebrating what he s done and just appreciating like the amount of thought and like intelligence that he has in using it in a bad way because like you can like iago and like him for different reasons than oh i like what he s done i like how he destroyed this person it can be just you know i realize that this is a very smart person and someone i really would not want to be on his bad side but like you just sort of you realize like how much i guess yeah i ll just use the word appreciate again you just appreciate like how much you understand his mind and it s just really interesting rather than you love him yeah i think it s more like sometime s it s fun to like root for like the evil character because you wouldn t actually do it like if you play video games like grand theft auto like you kill the hookers it s not like you would have to do that it s just that it s fun oh my god well it doesn t surprise me that iago s the one that most people come away from the play with being like yeah he s so great he s so interesting right because like he s the only character that you actually get to know everyone else just kind of like dies they get drunk and like stab people or they cry that s pretty much what everybody else does and then iago s the one who like lets you in lets you know what he s thinking when he s bringing specific elements like with each person in the play he s different from each person and you can see that through the play well as she was saying like how everyone else was crying and like going crazy or like either having an awful time or having a good time like they still trust iago even though he s standing there not doing that with them i mean just like the way he s able to still convince them whenever he s not he doesn t seem like he s on the like he convinced them that he s on their side but he s not actually doing everything they are or he s not really doing anything to show them that s he s isn t feeling what they re feeling alex i have a quote i guess it s at around there and their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it they do when they change us for others is it sport i think it is and doth affection breed it i think it doth is t frailty that thus errs it is so too and have we not affections desires for sport and frailty as men have then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so so it s kind of like talking about how the men control the women and so i guess like that s like the sexism of the day or like of that era and like this is emilia she s talking to desdemona and she s talking about how like men control them and all their thoughts are kind of implanted by the men like emilia like she got the handkerchief because her husband told her to do that and they re all just really obedient and everything chloe i mean i think that yeah it has to do with the time period as far as the sexism in the play or whatever but i mean because that it s just the way it was but i think that when you look at the female characters in the play like emilia she turns out to be one of the most influential characters and she s the one that takes down the bad person it s her that takes down iago pretty much because she tells him the truth and then something that none of the men could do or even question then the other thing i would say is that the women s loyalty to each other especially desdemona to emilia because it s back earlier in the play i don t actually have it but emilia i mean desdemona sings a song earlier in the play something willow willow willow some more stuff about the song and then when emilia s dying she sings a line from that exact same song and she says she references my mistress death so i think a lot of it shows how the women stick together it s also kind of like i mean i agree with you and i mean it s not sexist it looks at sexism because i mean you see how desdemona is the stereotypical woman of that time and she kind of does what her husband tells her to she doesn t rebel against him she is completely loyal to him regardless of how he treats her i mean he s hit her and she just accepts it even when he kills her she takes the blame and doesn t rat him out and it just kind of you have problems respecting her because of it like i mean she s a good character but you just can t it s really hard to respect someone who just accepts everything that is done to her like that then you have to juxtapose it with emilia and she was a really influential character and is able to rise above and kind of try to take down her own husband and go against it it s kind of looking at sexism and saying like you know which is better for you which do you like more look at how the sexism and the roles of women has affected desdemona and then how emilia s been able to rise above it can i jump in yeah i definitely agree with you but my thoughts are also going back to act i scene iii because i think at the beginning of the play desdemona is very much not a stereotypical woman she has married the man she loves defying her father knowing her dad wouldn t like it she ran off and married him anyway when othello s talking about how he won her heart it was by telling the stories of the wars and it s actually very interesting because it says that desdemona would seriously she would be very interested in these stories even to the point where she wished she had been born a man then when othello says i have to go to war and the duke says let s like desdemona stay at her dad s house desdemona says no i married this man to be with him let me go to the war also so at least at that scene i think that she s a model of a very very active woman who wants to go to war with her husband she wants to be with her husband when othello comes out in act ii scene iii to stop the fight between cassio and roderigo desdemona comes out too and says what s going on what s wrong and othello says come away sweetie let s go back to bed right i certainly agree that there s a passivity in desdemona by the end but i don t know if i see that so much at the beginning go ahead i agree i think that like sometimes desdemona wants to be the stereotypical woman and then like other times she wants to be the like rebel kind of because like mr proctor said like she completely rebels against her dad at the beginning and then also like she s not the stereotypical woman because like every single man like in the play has admitted that she s the most beautiful woman that they want her and all this stuff and so she has some power over them too but yeah i just think it s interesting how like there are scenes where she s the complete like stereotypical housewoman and then other times she s like completely passive even though it s been brought up that she defied her father to marry othello she s still i feel like she s still very like part of that time period as far as the role of women because even though othello wasn t her perfect husband in the eyes of her father she still jumped from the control of one man her father to another man her husband so tanya okay so about desdemona i think that like even though she did that stuff she still was a stereotypical woman like we said before those women they re supposed to be obedient to their husbands so like whenever she does kind of like rebel and do something different from or like kind of jump in to the conver like mr proctor was saying like those examples she s doing it for othello she jumps in like she goes to war to be with him and then she comes in like whenever he s in trouble and then the thing about emilia is she s doing stuff for herself like in act iv scene iii yeah that s what we read she s talking about how it s just like she would cheat on her husband once it s just like she says the world s a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice,0.0
can someone come up and put number one on the graph and then we re going to debate about it anassia can you come up and show us where you think one should be alright so what i think is i don t know if i m right or wrong or whatever but i thought kinda one is there do you guys see it no ok back can you give us a reason why ok well it says david had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant so i kinda think that from home the restaurant must be close that s why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card we don t know if he has money on him ya know it could depend on circumstances but i think that the restaurant was hella close that s why he went back and went back home ok wait wait wait wait wait wait wait ok so honestly who has that opinion so you think one is at the very beginning mmmhmmm of his trip ok can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place anassia can you pick someone overwhelming you i put it right here right there right there ok can you give us a reason he s driving and then he goes to the restaurant and then he s driving away no this is the restaurant right here and then he s leaving and he s like oh snap i left my credit card then he goes back and then he s driving away that s it ok wait so whose idea do we agree with sidius or anassia sidius ok but we still have to convince anassia because she still thinks it s at the beginning right i thought it was at the beginning too you did who convinced you myself yourself ok so if david is driving back to the restaurant then should his slope be what what should his slope be negative if he s going back to the restaurant right because if i m travelling this way my slope s getting bigger my distance is getting farther but wait i turn back so my slope has to be negative negative so do you think one is when the slope gets negative yeah so are you convinced now anasstia that it has to be negative for him to go back yeah so are we ok with erasing that first one well i have to erase all of it anyway oh ok sorry ok so one should be where he s going back right where he s going negative ok alright is there a real end to it well we re going to see once we get through them alright so sidi can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be no hands i would put two here can you explain why candy wait just give us an explanation yeah because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative he went back close to his house yeah near his house but then it s near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero because the line there represents the distance from his home right i ve got a question ok you know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house we re looking at his car not looking at the tow away car aren t we so wouldn t it be considered constant since his car is moving so i guess the car is on the tow truck right so now wherever the tow truck goes the car has to go right yeah does anyone have a different place for number two no so we all agree that two no do you want to put two in a different place put it in a different place let s see what you think put it in a different place let s see what you think go i was thinking of putting it right here that s what i was thinking that s what i thought too can you explain why why because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house so i was thinking that the first sentence so his car broke down so if he was not going anywhere then the time was going then constant so if as you see the time his speed never changes while the time is just going down that s what i think that s wrong we don t say that s wrong we say well i disagree well so convince him otherwise because the car is still moving and if you look really really closer at the graph the last point isn t directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero also if it was constant that means he would just be in one spot but it s clearly saying that he s being towed back towards the repair shop so he s in motion like the slope is showing distance and not speed well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere so can i say two things one thing so it s a different interpretation of this problem right so if he was broken down and the car was just staying there then would this be a good place for two yes if the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing it s not changing right because time is going on but distance is staying the same however number two says he s going to the repair shop close to his house so is he just staying in one place no right so he s gonna go back home so if he s going back home so this slope would be negative or positive negative negative and it s going here s home right so where does he go back home or very close to home here right are you convinced danny yes ok let s erase the other number two but danny thank you for being brave because i could understand that interpretation alright danny can you pick someone to put number three on the graph ok number three is over here i disagree wait wait we haven t even heard her explanation wendy what s your explanation why because it s stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it s kinda constant here so it can be stopped so why not the long one because he s in the restaurant i suppose but then so if one is here if one is here it has to be in the restaurant then right well then one is over there so then why would three be all the way over there one is here right no no no one is all the way at the beginning no sorry that s y but then it says that he got a three yes but it s here yeah he ate there so wouldn t that be the one like wouldn t that be where he gets his gas number three said that he went to eat but it doesn t say where did he eat maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about yeah maybe he went a bit farther and said ok let me go somewhere else so that s why so what did he do here eat and gas it doesn t take that long to eat one hour people take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can t just eat while they re getting gas oh let me eat while i m getting gas ok so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station the restaurant the restaurant so do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time short shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is right so we haven t gotten to the restaurant yet have we no no ok so could three be the place where he stops and gets gas could it be possibly we don t know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour or maybe it meant five minutes yeah you know you never know so if we interpreted five minutes gas and quick bite quick sandwich could we put three at that place yes why because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time i think that at three he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card maybe the gas station is near the restaurant why you make this so difficult that s possible though right i m like thinking of putting at the beginning here here is four wait wait wait don t go on four yet but i think the three should be before one because you can t just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich ok we re going to do this because i like the debate you re having but i want groups to think about it individually and then we re going to come back but i want to put one thing for sure on the board ok so if if if if if if this is definitely let s say this is definitely where david stopped to eat ok so this is where david is eating eating as in in the restaurant eating at the restaurant yes so here david is eating for a long time at the restaurant ok a long long time so that s the longest is this the longest time where the slope is flat yeah so we re all gonna agree right now that this is where david is eating at the restaurant so this is where david is eating at the restaurant can you put all the other numbers in a logical place because i hear you guys talking about logic like he can t go to the gas station before he does what goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card ok so i see that s one logical statement so in your groups i m gonna give you five minutes for this can you put one two three and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it ok,0.0
who s done writing okay alright ok couple of goals for this piece today here s where we re at here one clearly get the notes and rhythms down because this comstock piece ok and so is the second middleston piece three the primo so we ll do both those today wanna get the notes learned the notes and rhythms learned but i also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece just like if we were getting ready for contest in march do one of those little example pieces for sight singing so we ll treat this in the same manner as that then i wanted to also as we re reading the piece take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it you ll see some things here in a minute alright so if we take a look at the piece and we ve already written solf ge in we take a look at the piece what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different repeats okay even before that like right up by the title canon canon what s that mean the canon okay what s a canon it s a round it s a round right so you have one set of music and then the same set of music follows it later right we do that in warm ups okay alright so a canon so you think soprano and alto are in canon it d probably be women and men probably women and men good good observation so we look at the structure where might that canon begin after a p at the bottom of the page okay so pick up to measure 11 alright okay so what kind of material do the guys have there it says we mix with the women s structure exactly that same material that the girls do so in our rehearsal noting that this is a canon at least to that point how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away girls and guys sing their parts together girls and guys sing their parts together good easy so if we do that then what might something else be helpful for us to do we re singing parts together maybe pair up typically we get together and we chant so let s do that first let s do the chanting just like we do for sight singing so you can practice that okay so what are our pairs gonna be soprano and tenor so you have to move and bass and alto so starting at solf ge girls you start at the beginning guys you simply start at measure pick up at measure 11 okay go on and move yes circle up right here alright who s gonna be our leader who wants to start us off alena alena okay you can start us off who s going to start the you okay there you go okay good go for it chant it quickly let s start at the beginning we are on the pick up to 4 so 1 2 3 and 4 so so mi fa so do re mi okay so now we got to the end of that go to measure 11 for the girls and measure 21 for the guys go right there and start it again so now girls you go measure 11 which is right where you finished and guys go to 21 same thing here that s a little bit different alright 1 and 2 let s all chant together in rhythm stay in your groups stay in your groups please but we re gonna start with the sopranos and altos and then we ll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page so start at the beginning everybody 1 2 and ready and go stop okay now guys you re gonna pick up there and girls you re gonna come in 2 beats later here we go ready and go okay go right on the coda please so we would ve done the repeat now we go back here go right on the coda please right after the double bar ready and go 3 4 fermata cut off please sopranos ready and go bass okay pretty good we ll come back to that that takes a little bit of fordating when you get together okay go back to sections let s do right in the not your traditional sections let s keep the basses over here altos over here tenors and sopranos over here so do two rows back in your sections okay so we re gonna do just like we chanted we re gonna partner up and we re gonna sing it at the same time okay at the same time so guys you re starting in measure 11 girls you re starting in measure pick up to 1 ready and do do do do do sing that first note please sopranos and altos and okay tenors and basses okay let s sing all at the same time right where your canon first name of the canon is here we go 1 2 and ready and sing okay sopranos sorry altos and basses here we go doo doo that s a mi here we go start that again 1 and beginning and go okay go back to the do do mi so la fa do la fa sing that ready on the do 1 2 do that again same spot 1 2 okay good excellent reading good for you now putting it together canon lots of people think oh canons are easy no problem it s the same thing except canons tend to be tricky we ll see how it goes here we go soprano and alto first do mi so mi do sing your first notes girls ready and here we go 1 2 and ready and go okay good i was gonna stop you before then but you did so well so we kept singing good for you okay so what happens at 21 for the girls well not sorry measure 11 for the girls does what something different so what would we call it b or the counter melody of this okay so it s kind of the same shape but it starts on what pitch class instead of do no sorry what did we first start at the beginning so and mi and this starts on do so different pitch class same shape but it s singing the fifth lower okay for soprano okay good let me hear the guys please you did really well until we got to the b section let me hear actually let s hear everybody do the b section so guys you re gonna start at 21 girls you re gonna start at 11 basses it s just no it s not it s not different at all do here is do find your first pitch,0.0
in my opinion i think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself telling the principal i should not pay 15 00 because then it wouldn t be a scholarship okay thank you very much i like the way the way you show you know how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket thank you very much i agree with julia because you should not choose people for like what kind of races they are or their culture you should choose them for what they ve been through like their hardest work or something okay so you mean they had jobs they had work it was right to feel that very good good job okay i think martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it okay in my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise and a great leader is wise okay i agree with alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn t pay for the jacket he didn t pay for the jacket so you thought because he didn t pay for the jacket then he s a great leader you think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that s what made him a great leader no i think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying oh okay here s the money okay so a greater leader should stand for what he believes is that what you are saying yes very good thank you very much for clarifying that go ahead daniel i was going to say that i agree with jennifer i think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe thank you very much go ahead in my opinion i think martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight as and being a good student all right thank you go ahead lisette in my opinion martha s grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like martha s grandpa very good so you need to stand your ground very good i think that the person who showed the most leadership was martha even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned she believed that even though the teachers they they some wanted to give it to someone else but some knew that she had earned it and she she spoke up not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself okay so you feel a great leader you know she speak up you know when something is wrong or in the way she shouldn t just keep it very good she has to tell someone very good good job go ahead it seems to me that martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket okay what are some of the other things you know that martha did she got she got since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble and be a good student okay so that means you know she has worked hard all this time very good thank you okay go ahead i believe that martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn t give up on trying to get it so a good leader you know she ll try to do whatever it takes you know to get what he or she wants is that what you re saying yes all right good job thank you in my opinion i think mr schmidt is a great leader because he was fair you know to fight for martha and not the other girl thank you who is the other girl joanne huh joanne okay so mr schmidt was fair enough you know to fight for martha instead of who joanne joanne thank you very much in my opinion it s martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best all right in my opinion i think mr smith because even though martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades because of her good grades good job in my opinion i believe that the one that showed leadership was mr smith because he was honest and fair to martha very very good thank you very much i agree with her because mr booney just wanted the person that had money which is joanne her father owned the only store in town so mr schmidt was actually being fair okay thank you for adding on to that now who is joanne s dad you know because everybody was saying i could hear juan you know when juan said because of joanne s dad who is joanne s dad how can we describe him he owns the only store in town hmm he owns the only store in town he owns the only store in town what else he s also part of the school board he s rich school board huh he s part of the school board so they had the decisions like in the school like what they do and stuff in the story he gives money to the school so maybe that s also why they wanted to pick joanne so they got more money very good thank you very much now that everybody has contributed now let s look at the next question the next question is this what does martha represent to you think about the leadership qualities that martha showed what does martha represent to you not only the leadership qualities all the other things that martha represents okay anybody can start anybody can start just jump in i believe that martha to me represents a great leader her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up thank you for sharing that she represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it she stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say very good it seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly great like that anybody can jump in it seems to me that martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket i disagree because martha did speak up for herself her grandfather just told her what to say i disagree because like her grandfather gave her most of her ideas if it wasn t for her grandfather she probably would ve tried to get the money but like her father said i mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it i agree with daniel because like well yeah i agree with arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn t have to pay for it instead of martha going to speak to the principal in person i disagree with that i disagree with that i disagree i disagree with daniel and javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say her grandpa didn t go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say i agree with myra because it s true i mean he didn t go martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said so that s why i say that martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather the grandfather might ve said that but she was the one that stood there and said it that took a lot of courage to me okay so you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough so i like what arkie said arkie said you know i disagree that martha was a leader and arkie open up that thank you very much archimedes thank you all of you for sharing that any other person to me martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble okay she worked really hard thank you any other person that wanted to add something it seems to me that martha is a that proves that it doesn t matter her race or color she could do anything the same as anybody else can do wow i agree with ashley because a lot of people discriminate like mexican people or like mexican americans just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they re not from the united states so you know what has martha done to straighten that or to disprove that she showed that who cares where you re from or who you are you can always do your best okay so you know there was martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing if we really work hard we know that it will work is that what i m hearing from all of you yes that it doesn t matter what race you know if you work really hard you know that you can achieve thank you very much for sharing that i really admire her because i know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it s somewhat sad because some people aren t allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they re from what i think is that it doesn t matter what you are no one is bad except for the person who s making fun of your race you are not the bad one it s the person who s making fun of you thank you very much any other person that wants to add something to this i agree because in a poem it says you can t persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them like persuade them thank you very much now let s go on to the last question thank you very much for sharing i could hear from all of you the last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with scholarship jacket think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations okay so think of that what other stories have you read okay anyone can start i think crossing the wire is somewhat similar because pablo was mexican too and they mistreated him and denied him a job however he worked as hard as martha thank you for sharing that you call that crossing what crossing the wire crossing the wire thank you i think the story of martin luther king is pretty similar to the scholarship jacket because they discriminated a lot against african americans because of their color but martin luther king stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we re different we re all the same just because of color doesn t separate us thank you very much for sharing that i agree with jennifer martin luther king said that it doesn t matter where you re from or who you are everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers thank you very much for sharing that i have seem the movie the blind side which is pretty similar to the story michael shows great leadership because he is an african american and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a catholic school to play football thank you i agree with carlos i ve also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely michael i agree with carlos because in that movie michael from the beginning he didn t want to go to school he actually had really low grades and the family he had they re from another race and even though he had really low scores they got him a tutor and they helped him like reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play wow thanks again i have read the outsiders which is a story about two classes of people the greasers and the soches the greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class okay at the end what happened did they succeed like martha did they achieve some of them died some of them died okay,0.0
present your position to the other side make sure that you include the sfi that backs up your position okay after that three minutes we ll swap sides all right so three minutes pros go right ahead we re talking about how minorities have made a lot of progress since reconstruction and political things originally there was no black senators or congressman but after reconstruction around 1865 there was two black senators and fourteen congressmen and now there s four black senators and i m sure more black congressmen it s like quadruple the representatives and other minorities are representative represented in the house and senate so they ve made a lot of progress becoming a representative government they didn t have the knowledge of earlier so that s one way reconstruction positively affected education in the south in america also these statistics show that even though even though certain states are slightly low on the circulation per capita statistics virginia is number fifteen which is relatively high for a southern state except florida is number thirty four and not all northern states were held higher than education held higher than southern states like pennsylvania west virginia and delaware which are all northern states are in relatively low positions on the scale and former slaves were able to kind of give back more to the culture and they influenced technology and science and advances in those and kind of started influencing culture in the south and kind of in all the united states so and it really basically spread freedom through the south and finally gave the former former slaves a voice and a place in the country and finally brought them together y all have anything else i found the ones they could like progress forward and they could because they have so many african american positions and authors for that for that i think overall it finally gave blacks a place and gave the south a place in the country again where they had been separated for so long kind of started bringing everybody together again because after the civil war the south still thought that we don t have to cooperate with the north all right guys that was pro all right three minutes let s here the anti three minutes and then we ll after listen real quick guys after this three minutes we ll give it another minute okay and one more minute after that for a rebuttal okay for the final statement of the pros okay go ahead antis 1865 time of reconstruction and during nothing really got done if you look at the statistics the infant mortality in mississippi is number one and if you go on to the lifestyle statistics mississippi is the very has the least number of museums concert halls and observatories in city centers showing the link between reconstruction and just how it affected the south and how nothing got done after the civil war let me i m sorry to interrupt let me ask you this what caused i mean there had to have been something i mean during reconstruction everything was progressing something happened to cause that overwhelming shift in numbers that you just pointed out that you know the southern states the old confederate states dominated the bottom of that poll why do you think that is why would that happen because the north is trying to punish the south after the civil war they re more focused on helping themselves and not helping the south because they re more focused on slavery than actually trying the help the south because they were trying to punish them so they didn t they were trying the free the slaves they weren t trying to help the south because they didn t want them to become stronger also was there a particular event that really solidified this that really made that come to fruition what is it the time frame of your question 1865 to 1877 okay so during reconstruction right so what happened at the end of reconstruction why 1877 what happened in 1877 they took the military out of the south exactly so if the military was pulled out what do you think caused this result economic constraints imposed by northern owners and eventual overseas competition hampered development and birmingham never developed into the world class steel making center that it was supposed to be so yeah it did sort of improve but it just never reached its potential because and it even says hampered by northern constraints so the north basically said you can t produce more steel because we say so so you can t so birmingham just couldn t really get any better at that point so the south has more industry now like everything in the south is in the lower twenty eight percent okay guys listen we re going to give you one more minute you have a one minute period the pros if you want to add a little rebuttal to what you just heard okay after this minute we re going to take two minutes to compile our final position okay like our final little thesis all right that we re going to present then to the class okay so one minute for a rebuttal from the pros go ahead because since the military left everybody revolted so they had no motivation everything that had been implemented for those years went out the window and but i think it s still a positive way was that it at least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order and the south still kind of had gotten a taste from the military on how the americans wanted things run and how they needed to do to function as america and so i think that mostly the military reconstruction like that was good because it kind of came in and helped them that way what is the number of african american senators and representatives what does it show what is the difference between reconstructive era huge difference all right guys listen up you get two minutes i need each side to compile your final argument okay your final statement this is what you re going to present to the rest of the class remember you need sfi to back up your position okay that sfi can be census data more importantly it can be book data okay just normal normal information from your text so two minutes go ahead and write it out if you want go each side comes up with their final points we could go into more detail on the three fifths compromise and we could mention the ku klux klan intimidated even though they got the vote they were still controlled by the white people yeah the social system still was there ok i ll write that down could this be applied too absolutely remember you have to explain to the class in a way that they can understand it okay they don t have that particular census data in front of them so make sure that you re clear when you present that as sfi in front of the class tell them how many libraries and virginia is the only one that s in the top fifty percent completed out of fifty and so all the southern states are in the bottom and then this is trying to say what twenty five right here oh so the bottom twenty five half existing at the time which was should we tell them that these states aren t or should we just not tell them no i would just most african americans that were unskilled at the time worked through this program to become more independent workers and to learn to read and write and so i ll go back to my statistics here virginia and florida all right guys we re going to go in this order listen up we re going to go in this order we re going to go economic then social political then educational okay the pros are going to give their positions first to the class all right now the chart that you have in front of you what i want you guys to do is while the rest of the groups are presenting their findings their positions i want you to take down three different pieces of information that you hear specific pieces of information that you guys hear from the presenter all right because you re going to use this when you formulate your own response at the end of class to how you feel about you know the efficacy of reconstruction based on what you ve heard okay you re going to make your decision so you need to make sure that you have information down to support that okay to support your idea and make sure you re getting that from their presentations all right so we re going to go with economic first economic pro you have two minutes camille you it yeah all right everybody listen to camille okay so we came up with a thesis and it was reconstruction positively affected america economically by bringing a broader selection of products to the south and north and the north was trying to find ways to help the south with the 13th and alabama and mississippi and everyone they started mining for coal and iron and everything and so that helped their economies because they were able to make more money with that instead of just cotton and the north put a few restrictions on that but that still helped their economy for more products and the north manufactured more like grain and we talked about other things that weren t really economic that was about it that we could come up with okay thank you all right anti who is our speaker today okay grant go ahead all right so you mentioned the steel and iron and coal industries and yes those did help but at the same time the north industries the north s economy was growing and it was growing faster than the south and there was the whole economic deals with inflation where so the south basically was making more like a higher number of dollars but it essentially was the same work as before the war,0.0

three two one stop okay were there pairs of you who chose different things um hmm and who wants to share i said if i had to pick i would pick the green cylinder because the white would overflow easy the pink you would have to reach down far to get it okay devon i would pick the pink one because it s like thin enough to be like a cup and you can do this with it and it would be a lot easier than just like doing this especially because if it gets on the bottom of the green one it would be hard to get it and the white one it might spill if you walk around with it or you could trip okay good layla but well i agreed with devon on the pink one but i would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn but it also is harder to hold unless you were to like since it has more area the white one has more area than the pink or the green one more area you re talking this way yeah okay so you re saying you take the popcorn and you could like you could make it even on the bottom of it so it wouldn t necessarily be overflowing unless you were when you walk for the popcorn thing okay all right brittany me and lani had the same answer we would think that it sort of relates to what devon said if we picked the green one because and related to the pink one s gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn and the green one is wide enough and it can hold it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one but it s still gonna be hard to get down the pink one and the white one s just gonna spill okay all right tiffany we thought that the green and pink one it doesn t matter because they re probably gonna hold the same capacity since they re the same shape it s just one s taller and one s shorter but the short one s wider and the tall one s skinnier it s tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same so you said either one of these two it didn t matter okay kylie i would want the green cup because it s easier like to get your hand down it the pink one looks like really skinny so if you have big hands it would be hard to get your hand down it okay all right amani i think the green one becuase when you look at it the old popcorn container and the green one they re kinda the same although the green one is a little bit bigger so then you could get more okay i said the green one also because the pink one is skinny and it if went to the same size as that with the same amount of popcorn it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one do you know what i m saying say that again okay i picked the green one because say you fill them with popcorn and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one and you put it in the green one it s gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one and the white one it s just gonna fall over cause it s too small it s too flat okay hold on josh now tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount did you say that mm hmm and why did you say that because they re the same size paper except one they re just folded different okay she said that because they re the same size paper they re folded differently but she thinks that they re gonna hold the same amount and you are disagreeing mm hmm okay she s disagreeing saying that the green one s going to hold more is that correct what you said i said yeah the green one would hold more okay josh what do you think i said i would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out and because it might have more volume than those two yeah okay so let s change our thinking here some of you did think about which one is going to hold more it didn t matter whether your hand could get easier into this one or devon liked this one cause he could tilt it up he didn t even have to have his hand in it at all which is an interesting way to look at it a lot of you said you didn t like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot yes ma am but unless you did what i suggested and you like evened it out on the bottom yes because you said you liked this one cause you thought it held more than the other two but you d have to like flat not necessarily like squish the popcorn so it s flat you d have to like shake things sideways so that it would even it out like food in a pan you would shake it to even it out on the bottom okay all right well it s kinda like with the little kid packs there are things shaped like that and it has like gummies and popcorn in it and i don t like it cause like everyone would get the other ones it would have like more popcorn in it okay tiffany what i would suggest the white one is like even it s the same shape as the other two pieces of paper but it s folded so it s taking less up space but it s folded because it overlaps here it does overlap here with the white you re right there but i disagree with molly because the popcorn amount that s inside of the inside the square ones at newtown is the same amount as one of the plastic ones the exact same amount of popcorn cause they actually use those as measuring cups i ve watched them do it and i ve watched them actually use those cups those hard ones to fill the other cup to fill the other ones so you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this all of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones as measuring cups all right devon i agree with layla like they re all the same i think it just depends on like who you are kind of like which one you want okay but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one yeah so if you could choose that would be a good thing right hold on a second let s move on a second and i m gonna have mk come up here and help me we re gonna see if they hold the same okay i want you however on your paper to write down you know which one you think holds the most do they hold the same or if you think they hold a different amount put em in order like which one is least middle greatest why don t you do that real quick why don t you put em in order which one do you think okay this is what she thinks she thinks least middle greatest here s what we re going to do i do not have popcorn but i do have cereal and hopefully hopefully mk can pour this hopefully okay so you re i m gonna hold it or would you rather hold it and me pour wait yeah you might wanna pour it okay and just make sure that the bottom stays okay we are smellin the sugar up here yeah okay can you all see that it s at the top yeah all right now what we are going to do so this is this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls we re gonna put this over top and you re gonna lift it up and see what happens and some of you have predicted that it s going to be the same right how many have predicted that they re all the same all the same okay how many are predicting that the green is bigger predicting that the green is bigger okay what about the white is biggest anybody predict the white is biggest okay why don t you lift this up i ll hold this this time you gotta make sure that pink s bigger ooh can you see can you see so there s more room right there s more room in the green one why because the more space it has the bigger around it is the more cereal that could fit in it so what is that called around here circumference well this is circumference but at the bottom volume it is volume cause we re measuring volume but what is at the bottom of this base a base is that what you re saying that the base it depends on how big the base is well let s look to see whether it ll fit in here okay there it is exact same room as the pink well do you think there s the exact same room as the pink no i think the white has more you think the white could fit more yeah okay thank you mk have a seat but what do we know about this one now it s the smallest it s the smallest do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here and figure out what the formula or the volume is like the length of it the length of the pink one does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures eight by is it eight by 12 eight by 12 eight by six eight by 10 eight by 10 eight by 10 a foot a foot eight by 11 okay it is actually eight and a half by 11 okay eight and a half by 11 so our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11 okay so for our pink one what is when we do this what is this the circumference its the circumference what do we know about the circumference then for the pink one that it s 8 5 it is 8 5 so circumference equals what 8 5 the circumference equals 8 5 are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference yes no you say yes yeah i know what you could do you could divide it by 3 14 cause that s how you get cause you know how it s the opposite of times so that you would do it and you would divide that by 8 4 no 3 14 and then you ll have the diameter and then you can just take half of that and that d be the radius okay all right tell me brittany what is the formula for circumference pi times d circumference equals pi times d i m gonna ask someone to restate what kiki said does anyone agree with kiki yes i do and what did she say she said that you can divide the circumference by 3 14 okay so we know the circumference is 8 5 correct and we know that pi is what molly 3 14 3 14 and we re trying to find the the what devon diameter the diameter okay so both kiki and maya say you divide by 3 14 is that what we do treyshawn yes so if i divide this side by 3 14 and i divide this side by 3 14 what happens to this right here india it would get smaller it gets smaller yes if you divide it okay what is 3 14 divided by 3 14 one sure,0.0
so just leave your clicker on your table guys i mean you can put one in front of you just don t turn it on yet they re not activated please don t play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day thank you for the help excellent thanks all right guys so let s get started with our discussion here set the clicker down please don t play with it just leave it on the table thank you i asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question danny devito is between 4 9 and 5 1 tall so i m 5 10 so danny devito is either between this tall or about this tall we re not sure on his height his wife rhea perlman is 5 0 tall how tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why all right so please raise your hand to share your answer and i m going to ask you why you think like you do so i m going to start back there with alex so turn this way so that i can hear you okay okay i think their kids would be around 5 because their mom is 5 tall and their dad his middle height is 5 okay so you re looking at the middle estimated height of danny devito and his wife s height is 5 so you think together then all their children will be 5 boys and girls mm hm okay great thank you what else do you think j r i said 5 too i said 5 as well because that s about how tall they are so their kid would be around that okay so you re looking at kind of his average height and her height so you think the kids will be around that okay anything different or you want to explain it further michael i just said that you get your height from your parents so whatever the parents were right around 5 the kids will be about 5 okay you get your height from your parents so since the parents are about 5 the kids will be 5 boys and girls yeah okay great what do you think well i think the daughter could be 4 9 and the sons would be around 5 2 because both of the parents are shorter and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents okay so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents and you said that the daughters could be about 4 9 and the sons might be about 5 2 yes is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls it s just kind of a normal thing normally boys are taller than girls okay so a normal thing boys are usually taller than girls okay great any other ideas on the height of their children adam what do you think well what do you think about i think that they ll be around i think boys and girls will both be around 5 because it s right inbetween the parents okay good what about me and my family i m 5 10 so i m tall what do you think about my family members how tall do you think they are i m 5 10 how tall do you think my mom is how tall do you think my dad is what s your estimation what do you think raise your hands everybody let s participate mackenzie what do you think i think your dad would be around 6 2 and i think your mom would be around 5 11 or 5 9 okay so my mom is between 5 9 and 5 11 so close to my height and my dad would be taller about 6 2 brian what do you think i said that i think your dad would be taller than you but then your mom would be around the same height so my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller yeah anybody think anything pardon me or like around 6 my dad would be around 6 yeah what if i tell you my little brother my little baby brother is 6 4 and he is this is true he is 6 4 so he s a tall guy does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents you guys are nodding yes what do you think now travis maybe your dad is like 6 4 and your mom is like 5 8 or 5 9 or something okay so mom is about here dad is taller or 6 4 like my little brother michael what do you think both of them are about 6 both of them are about 6 okay great what do you think well i know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad from dads so that your dad is taller around 6 5 and then your mom is shorter like 5 8 so you see my height and my mom is about 5 8 and my dad is 6 5 so for my brother and i you re figuring about our traits what do you mean that you get your traits from your dad so my dad s genes are coming through why do you think that why do you think i have only traits from my dad because i know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom so more traits from dad than from mom do you think that s pretty much general yeah okay great do you guys have anything to comment on that what do you think i think your dad s probably like 6 2 because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they re still in high school oh interesting well i ll tell you my mom was 5 11 at her tallest now she s shrinking she s like 5 9 you know how that happens as you get older and my dad he s only 6 tall so my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother he s 6 1 so height does come from both sides but my dad s not as tall you guy s might ve thought let s talk about danny devito again here he is our favorite actor right notice his lack of hair he s bald the question on here says danny devito is bald what do you think his son s hair or lack of will look like when he s older and why his son danny devitto has a son what do you think about his hair nice and loud so i can hear you matthew it said that their son would have bald hair on the top but some on the sides some will be bald on the top but he ll have some hair around the sides why do you think that because usually if somebody s dad s bald they re not always bald if somebody s dad is bald they are not always bald i ve seen that you ve seen that that s a good observation matt what do you think well the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald so i thought he will still have a lot more hair than his dad he wouldn t be completely bald but bald on top okay so mom has a lot of hair dad s bald so you think the son will have hair but just bald on top yeah so when you see the traits being passed down how do you see it i m not really sure what you mean by that question you re kind of saying that he ll have this trait but he ll also have this trait so how do you see that happening did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another the son or do you think i think they were combined they were combined the traits are combined good sean i thought he would have like a blackish brown hair because that s what the mom s hair color is okay he probably wouldn t be bald but he d have a receding hairline okay so he would have a receding hairline and for those of us that don t know what that means that means when a person starts to lose their hair and it kind of inches back and they re losing their hair that s what a receding hairline is so the hair falls out as it moves back are you ready to see what danny devito s kids look like here they are for our predictions we have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family he s about 5 5 so he s taller than both mom and dad this is danny devito s wife danny devito and his son here s his daughters this daughter is about the height of the mom but she has big shoes on the other daughter is taller but notice their hair what do you notice about their hair ryan tell me what you notice about all three kids well they all have hair they re not bald they all have hair they re not bald how would you describe their hair curly curly hair what color black black or dark brown yes very good all right so we see that now when we think about these bunnies another question i asked you is this look at the picture if they had ten offspring what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like the fur in what respect that was the question nathan what do you think 25 would be white 25 would be black the remainder would be gray with a little white so part of them will be black and part of them will be white so half of them will be gray okay so here s what we have i m going to use abbreviations and 50 will be gray nathan says that because one parent is white one s black they ll combine to form a gray color just like mixing paint in art class any other predictions what else are you thinking let s hear from somebody new what else do you think omar i think 40 of the bunnies are going to be black are going to be half black and half white like a black bunny with white dots or a white bunny with black dots all right so you re saying 40 black 40 white you will see both colors we ll see black and we ll see white why did you choose 40 40 and 20 because i think that it s rare for bunnies to have dots it might be rare for them to have dots okay so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely the probability is higher for a solid color so that s why you chose 20 great great thinking great explanation sean what do you think i had 20 white and the rest are gray i would have said 25 but you can t have two and a half babies being white okay all right so you would ve said 25 so you were thinking similarly yeah why do you say 20 20 and 60 because most of them would be a mixture of the two but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit s traits okay so because they have offspring the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits so mom and dad will blend together to create gray but some of them will look just like the father some will look just like the mother so some will be black some will be white great one more idea kasey what do you think i know in health that everyone has a dominant feature i think white is so that the majority so like 40 would be white and 20 would be black and then the rest would be gray 40 white 20 black and 20 gray and you said because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe that s only 80 oh what did you say for the last one i said the rest wow well thanks for paying attention good check there guys it would be 40 60 we need 40 did you say 40 i said the rest i was just making up too many different numbers well i m so happy that you guys are paying attention i m going to tell your math teacher good job okay 40 white but here s what kasey said that was really good she said that 40 will be white because white is dominant you used that word you talked about that in health a little bit so let s talk about dominant and what that means what does it mean what do you think dominant means and be nice and loud for us john most of most of good what do you think sam main main sean the majority the majority alex beat out all others beat out all others nice what do you think sean strongest okay let me show you a little example here so where do we get our traits first of all where do we get traits from parents from where parents your parents okay it s passed down traits are passed down and some come from each parent right dominant recessive some come from both mom and dad if you received a dominant trait see i labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait so half and half mom and dad they come together which trait do you see the dominant one or the recessive one the dominant one the dominant one what if i put it this way which trait do you see the dominant one what if i put two recessive traits together the recessive the recessive okay either way i pair them mom or dad dad or mom if i have two dominant traits that go together what do i see dominant dominant okay so if the dominant trait is present then finish the sentence if the dominant trait is present in your genes then what it will show it will show kasey says that s right if the dominant trait is present it will show are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro okay let s check this then real quick yesterday you filled out this concept map let s make sure that your answers are correct jsut take a look so read this with me genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits from parent to offspring and if the offspring has the same alleles we call that purebred and if they have different alleles hybrid what that means allele that word say that allele allele it s the fun word to say during our genetics unit that s the form of the gene so is it a dominant or is it a recessive okay so let s go back here genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits i don t hear everybody controlled by genes made of alleles say it again alleles alleles so genes made of alleles shows when present we call that dominant and can be masked recessive recessive all right very good any questions on the concept map any corrections if you need to make them please do so all right well let s get going with our lab are you guys ready okay please take out your lab paper we re going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on notice the top of the paper it says problem this is what we re trying to solve this is the point of our scientific investigation are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles i d like you on the lines to create your own hypothesis or your prediction for this are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common that s the question are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles so write down what you think write down your prediction if you can write it in the if then format of how we do hypotheses that s preferred but if that confuses you at this point just write what you think is going to happen are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles whatever you think it s your thinking we will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment so once you ve written down your hypothesis reread it and make sure that it answers the question then we re going to get to work using our clickers which i ll explain in just a moment i d like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin the question again are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles please share your prediction your hypothesis ronnie i said yes because dominant alleles it shows over recessive alleles so you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles okay great girls one of you share your hypothesis for me who would like to share everyones looking at you kate what do you have on your paper i said that i thought the dominant alleles were more common you believe the dominant alleles will be more common okay great thank you another one alex i agreed with it i said that i believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive because there s more combinations to get dominant one s over recessive you believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive because there s more combinations to get that to get to that to get the dominant traits to show good one more matthew i said that the dominant traits are less common because in the picture with danny devito his son and daughters didn t look much like him okay so you believe that the dominant traits are less common because in the example of danny devito his kids didn t look much like him yeah and how your younger brother is 6 4 and how my younger brother is 6 4 but he s taller than the rest of my family okay so you re making connections to our earlier conversation good we re going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab,0.0
a prediction on the weather temperatures okay so maybe they can predict something that s going to happen yes okay so based on the information that you collected is there any information let s say you could go out the next day what do you think based on what you saw what do you think might happen the next day it might go back down into the 30s or the 20s okay and what makes you say that because there s more 30s and 20s then there are 50s and 40s and then there was a large spike so okay so it got warmer but you re saying because most of them were cooler it might get cooler again yes okay so you re making a conclusion you re using your data to support that shaun what are you thinking i was thinking that maybe they might want to track it because maybe weather can not evolve over time but how much it s changing and predict what s gonna happen okay so you re thinking like a meteorologist or a scientist might make a forecast make a prediction so you re thinking sort of like hava and were your temperatures similar to her or were they very different because you might have been at two different stations what do you think might happen on the next day i think it will drop down to the 30s because i see that it s dropping down it s going up and then it s dropping down i think it s gonna go up and then drop down again okay and it does look like you had kind of a trend here so what do you think if you had a day that went down do you think it might go up again mhm might peak up again okay is there anybody else who s looking at their data thinking of what else might happen with that temperature change madison are you looking at something yeah what do you think well with the wind speed and it would be like 8 5 for quite a few times a day sort of shot up into so what do you think that was indicating that it was a very windy day a very windy day okay so you guys some of you look at your charts if you were madison was in group a and can you make a connection or h madison can you make a connection to your wind speed really spiked on that same day did you have any difference or did you have something happen in your temperature well the temperature was about 20 degrees and because of the wind was making it cooler okay so you re saying that you think that the wind also has an effect on the temperature mhm okay so was there anybody else in group h that recorded that sort of thing you had a big windy gust you had a very windy day your temperatures went down did you have a similar thing happen to you hava yes yes okay so you guys why would we want to track something like not only temperature but also the wind speed jada so that they can know what tomorrow s gonna be like or what another day s gonna be like or for them to know if it s gonna rain or okay what the temperature is gonna do so they want to think maybe more you guys now your thinking jada you re even putting together precipitation so maybe there s a consequence of precipitation no with low temperature and maybe heat can evaporate some water and then the next day it can get dropped down and get colder okay so maybe a connection with the precipitation temperature those sorts of things okay katie o what are you thinking i would think that they wouldn t just want to track the temperature but they d also do the wind speed because wind speed can change how what the temperature is and how it changes so why do you think wind speed makes a difference with temperature what are you making the connection with what s your evidence well wind speed i think would change like it wouldn t make it warmer it would make the temperature feel colder okay so why do you think that because the wind well you go out to the playground a lot right yeah and when you guys are on the playground and it s really windy is it warm no okay so maybe are you thinking like when you go out there and it s really windy and you don t have a coat does it feel cooler to you yes does it on sometimes yeah alright so maybe they re maybe a prediction and so you were saying they so are you thinking scientists and meteorologists are trying to put those two together those phenomenons yeah okay so katie o let me ask you if this was a hypothesis that you were saying if it s windier then it may be cooler you guys agree as a class okay thumps up thumbs down what do you guys think yes no maybe a little bit there alright josh what are you thinking i was saying that if people are always looking at the temperature so we know what s gonna happen when it s gonna happen what we can expect what we need to do okay so we re taking that forecast even further maybe so let me kind of pose another question real quick before i keep going you guys let me ask you you guys remember when you went on the computer and you watched the hurricanes and you tracked the hurricanes so was that data indicating the speed or the movement of the hurricane yes yes so does a meteorologist even track something like that to be able to maybe help people yes okay so do you guys remember when the meteorologist came to visit us you guys remember that and he really talked to us a lot about tornadoes didn t he but he was also giving us situations of how we know a tornado might be forming right so yeah does that make sense that that might be another reason that they start tracking so think and talk to your shoulder partner besides a hurricane what else might they track to like josh was saying to prepare us for to let us know so talk to your shoulder partner the weather because some people can know what to like my hands yeah or like tornadoes yeah or maybe even thunderstorms or the normal weather very intense temperatures we can already know maybe even like snow because that can be a really heavy and or kind of get everywhere like snowbound us or it could like be rain snow hail so what do you think emily what else can we determine snow storm or a tornado or a earthquake so what were you thinking first alexis and then we ll come back to nick i was thinking either a tornado or blizzard snowstorm okay so what kind of weather do you think they re tracking in order for us to be prepared about weather what do we wind wind maybe and temperature snow okay so if we re looking for just a tornado maybe temperature maybe the wind yeah what kind of wind is it is it cold or hot yeah okay hot and cold fronts and then we were thinking about what else nick i would say a flood because maybe maybe the clouds are coming and there s going to be a bunch of rain like you said that we could get a flash flood okay so and are you making that connection to maybe our area that had a fire and so we have to think about would there be because it can t absorb the moisture okay so that s another idea so how would meteorologist or scientists how would they austin how would they predict maybe a flood happening what do you think they d use what kind of information would they be looking at well if a rainstorm was coming because that rain would cause a flood okay so a large amount of rain that would make sense yes or snow or even if we had a lot of snow so if we had large amounts of snow what could we possibly be warning people of if that was the case alexis what do you think stay inside or wear warm clothes if you go somewhere or something so they don t get so cold okay so would you guys say would one of you formulate some sort of a hypothesis about snow coming if there was if there was enough cold air and some times when it s raining it starts to hail and then it starts to sometimes it starts to snow so if there s cold weather and clouds then we might have consequences snow or rain or yeah of hail or heavy snow yeah okay so we d wanna keep that in mind and does that seem to happen in our areas sometimes sometimes and sometimes when we make that forecast and then maybe it doesn t come that happened on saturday okay so if it does come what happened on saturday austin i think it was really humid out at first mhm and then it started to rain and then a lot of times usually rain starts out as ice and then it melts and it started to get colder and then it started to hail so then we have the consequences of a hailstorm didn t last saturday did it start out really nice first yeah yeah and then also happened yesterday too because when i got picked up it was nice and warm and everything and then when i got to my house it was all windy and then it started raining so i was like i thought it was supposed to be hot today right so is it possible to use forecasting information and still be wrong yes well in the weather book it explains the rating of tornadoes so i m thinking tornadoes or something to track like the wind speed if it s gets too crazy it get like wind miles per hour and how bad it is like if the wind speed s really high then it can cause a tornado like the scale so they use that information we were just talking and showing the things that they might be using for information that they re collecting to do what now to give to the what they re doing it to give us warnings they can t tell us that a tornado s happening prior to it right so they have to warn us about them and so i think they collect the data from that to do that okay and then reagan what were you connecting that with i was connecting it with a blizzard or snow storm because if there s a delay and you need to go somewhere you can know that there might be delays and if you re gonna go outside you need to wear a coat a heavy coat okay so how do we respond how do we react to it good okay you guys i was going around and i heard some excellent conversations and so i think you guys made strong connections with your data and probably with your meteorologist visit what they were telling you and how you were putting that information together so i want you guys to go ahead and pick up your pencils and write underneath your graphs i want you to answer this question what does your data tell you so write there on underneath your graph or write on your graph you could even write right in the middle of your graph i want you to write what is your graph actually telling you so is it telling you that you had a series of cold days make your prediction so go ahead and take a minute or two write down what your data tells you and then what changes did you observe what was the most significant change that you observed if at all possible while you re writing that you can come up with a hypothesis about your data it could either be your wind speed or it could be your temperature write down what it is that actually took place yeah you want to answer the question what does your data tell you what changes did you observe on either graph or you can even write a sentence that combines the two of them together so mine says i added a little more it says it is telling me all about my wind speed and how it s going high or low or high what does your say austin mine is it had cold and hot days and it went from 44 degrees fahrenheit to 20 degrees fahrenheit so go ahead just like alexis and austin shared go ahead and share with your face partner this time so that you change who you re talking to so emily and madison you can also share what you wrote it tells me that some times it can be hot and then go down to a little bit colder and then it goes back into hot yeah that s what i was kinda saying when i told the wind speed because it s not always wind speed yeah it s not always wind speed but most of the time when we took it it was mostly in the winter so it would mostly go down like it was 40 then it was 25 then it was 20 and then it was 30 and then it was 30 and then it was 40 and then it was 50 so that s what so john what did you figure out from your data i figured out that it was colder the week we were doing this okay and the wind speed was not very high okay oh yeah yeah so you were in an area that maybe was more protected by the wind do you think yeah we were behind the building oh okay so that might of had an effect too yeah okay did you draw any conclusions from that i forgot to do that okay great braden tell us a little bit about what you observed from your data well i observed that i did not get much wind speed okay so where was your station were you at a protected area as well yes okay so that definitely had an effect didn t it yes so as a meteorologist would you want to be able to put your anemometers somewhere where you know you re gonna catch the wind yep okay so that was a really important lesson right there too so what about your thermometer readings since those weren t dependent necessarily on being protected from the wind what can you observe from your thermometer reading well that it was and then on tuesday and wednesday it got colder okay so it got colder on tuesday and wednesday so if you were making a prediction what do you think would happen on this day based on your data do you think it s gonna change stay the same what do you think stay the same seems like it s gonna stay the same because you have that pretty consistently yeah okay alright tariq what do you find from your data what did you discover observing i noticed that for my temperature i had up and down weather so your temperature was would you say it was fluctuating yeah okay why do you think that was happening because well it was cold on the days we went out but where we were the sun was kind of coming towards us at the times we went out so do you think that had an effect on your thermometer as well yeah hm okay so then that s another thing as a meteorologist you might want to think about where your thermometer is right are you just getting straight sun okay was there something else you were gonna say about your wind speed well my wind speed on monday we got a lot and on thursday we got a lot on the other two days we didn t get any wind not too much okay then then i also had go ahead all three of us were in the same group you were in the same group alright so there you go and i also had to say that my wind speed was never below 20 degrees you to pull out your sheet right there that you have about your temperature on the moon i want to ask you one more question and i want you to think about your temperature on the moon now did you actually go to the moon to get your data no no but let s look at the scientists who recorded that data why was it important for them to find out the temperature on the moon and as you look at it did it change very much so why was it important and did it change very much okay jaime i thought that on one of the missions that it was different temperatures like it would be and then it dropped down to about 200 okay and so you re specifically talking about the day yeah okay and so you re saying is it pretty similar is that you re saying pretty similar but not very okay so the main thing is that it didn t stay the same okay it didn t seem to stay the same no okay and then we had not only day temperature but was the other temperature that we looked at on the moon night nighttime okay so what were you thinking about that shaun i kind of had the same data as jamie did okay because it switched every single mission so on mission 11 it was well 200 and about 13 degrees okay and it just kept on going down and up each mission so it changed significantly each mission,0.0
three oh it makes like a cubic graph it s like a cube oh whoa that s pretty cool what about what if only two of them are the same it s like a quadratic all right so as we go through the investigation now we re gonna look at try to come up with conjecture for that numerically why do you think that happens if two factors are the same because it makes like because if you have two factors are the same that s the same as like squaring one of the factors what happens if you square numbers they become positive i believe so it s always positive for that section very nice okay keep on keep on going with that all right just say a b c d e etcetera e is the zeros of the law i m on the first one why are they the same they re squared go to google docs see if you can do files the file is gray okay so what s gonna happen is you re gonna have a factor formula unlike the other one we had it instead and what you want to look at is look at the factors and look at the zeros what s the relationship between the factors and zeros you may already know what the relationship is can you predict what it s gonna be that the factors tell you the zeros like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are and why would that makes sense to you oh because when it s x and you have a number after that that s where it is on the x axis so that could be where the zeros in a set right maybe teresa does that make sense to you you look kinda confused like so x minus one is no that is wrong then well here look at your flag look right here it s sittin right here so x minus one so that s one so there s one one and then x minus two is the there too oh so it s the opposite of the form so if you haven t factored form then you know that it s even zero yeah yeah it would be equal to zero right yeah you re right remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing yeah all right so that does make sense does the end behavior make sense it s in factored form but what s the degree of that it s three it s the third degree and what does a third degree what did we learn last time it can intersect three times it can intersect three times does it yeah and what s the end date down and up down and up and it is right yup so that makes sense that does make sense why don t you try it with quadratic factor here and why don t you put in an extra factor just edit that just add that x whatever something we ve not used yet what s the f in this one the eraser but you added this one right yeah so what do we except s gonna happen how many zeros are we gonna get this time four what s the degree so what should the end behavior be because you weren t here last time so let s see if you pick it up so if it s fourth degree what s gonna happen on the right what s gonna happen on the left both good yay high five get rid of the space after the parenthesis which one between the parenthesis and the f yeah add a space there s not an f see the sliders here this f was there to start out with so just delete it then yeah just delete that so x minus e is just that so we expect did it come out the way you excepted it to come out yeah there s four zeros and if you slide those zeros go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense oh that s good oh because it changes whatever the final one would be at so if we had like x plus something where is the actual zero oh it is x plus something it s the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place so if we say x x plus three where s the zero negative three does that make sense because x plus three equals zero yeah all right what s the next question on there does the y intercept change all right so let s look at your zeros and look at your y intercept as you change the sliders does the y intercept change we can t see our y intercept you gotta scroll out mr dillard would you get me me the mouse over there the silver one yeah it s a lot easier to do this with a mouse i got it other way because the y intercept is now it might be really yeah it s right there why don t we try making some of these factors smaller so that we can see it a little better i got it oh fine i see how it is okay can you see it it s like at negative 15 okay is there a relationship between that y intercept and the factors or the zeros why don t you guys talk it over what are the zeros so the zeros are what are the zeros and the zeros are all the numbers that are they re the opposite of this so it would be negative two four and a half and one wait what s the y intercept it s 15 two yeah it s down here it s actually 18 and it s negative 18 four and a half times two is nine times two is 18 times one it s 18 you multiply all the end numbers together and you get the y intercept well that s nice that is cool but why does that make sense why would that work why does that work oh because to get the y intercept the y intercept doesn t have an x value so you just in order to factor this equation you would just multiply all the end ones to get it oh yeah because it s the numbers after x like almost zeros zeros well are the numbers after x the actual zeros if it said x plus three the roots x plus three what would the zero be for that negative so they re the inverse of the zeros the opposite the opposite yeah you have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning all right so if we know what the zeros are and we multiply those and we got the y intercept right yeah what about a what happens when you slide a around does that change slide a around i already know what should happen you can just use the mouse i can t click it move oh that s why it changes the middle one did it change the zero start with that does it change the zeros at all no no no it doesn t change the zeros well okay go back to it s not changing the zero well actually well it s just changing it s steepness yeah it s changing it s steepness and the width but it s not changing the zeros well yeah it does because when it s flat then every number s changed but when its flat but that s only if a is zero since they re multiplying everything by a then if a is zero everything is zero so yeah you have a zero degree polynomial at that point yeah yeah okay so other than when a is zero all it s changing is the steepness of the graph and not changing the zeros so does that change the y intercept um yes it is changing the y intercept but i think it still works out as um you can still multiply all of them together does that make sense check and see if it still works oh whatever a is is a is the opposite of the y intercept because if a is four then the y intercept here is or that might just be well that s a good conjecture check some of the other things and see if it still works um try changing yeah yeah no that s not right that would be cool it was just the way i had it and that s one of the nice thing with the sliders because you might see a connection but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case the y intercept is six yeah it s still ah when you change a it s still going to effect the y intercept and as changing as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by a does that make sense yeah so all those numbers multiplied together is still six keep going with this because the next thing we re gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same when we use the factor more than once okay keep going are we on six now yes what happens when two or more factors are the same so make e and e i m gonna make them all three i work hard for you guys you criticize me um the e the e oh it makes the when they re the same try changing one of them try changing one of the sliders we figured that one it just turns out to be the opposite so go ahead and change one slider just pick one other than a pick b or something like that the opposite of that variable becomes the y intercept that doesn t explain the zeros now something we want to find out is there a relationship between the zeros and the y intercept oh there is when you change the y then the zeros equal the opposite of the y intercept okay what happens if you change two no it doesn t oh yeah yeah it does oh yeah zero does the one that isn t the same numerical i think the right most zero becomes it when you move them the y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate because if you move like c steadily to the left once c is two negative two jacob said half the time when you multiply them all together you get it yeah that s what we re discussing the absolute value of the y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero if two of the factors are the same that s in if all of the variables are the same except one of them it becomes the zero it becomes the zero and the opposite of the y intercept so now as you slide you ll actually be able to see the y intercept if you set all the variables the same and change one of them it becomes the zero and the opposite of the y intercept okay so on dave s right here yeah the multiplication in case you like if you multiply all the zeros together you get the opposite of the y intercept does it have to do with the factor formula yeah yeah so the absolute value of the if you multiply the zero so does it make sense algebraically yes why does it make sense algebraically when you find the factor with that new grouping you have to it becomes the opposite but y intercepts algebraically because the y intercept is when all the x s are zeros so you re just left with the one that doesn t have an x on it and that is the multiplication of all the factors all the numbers,0.0
can you make some shadows i see light how will you make a shadow how are you making a shadow how are you making a shadow alicia my hands what is your hand doing making a shadow how is it making a shadow i don t know how is it making a shadow brandon because your hand is stopping the light your hand is stopping the light and it s small cause your hand is far away from your body and more light comes around your hand what happens if you move it close to the light it has it big because it stops more light because it stops more light it s stopping more light you re right let s go see what these guys are doing what are you guys doing blocking the light from the light in there you re blocking the light how are you blocking it we re going forwards and backwards to make it little so i see your shadow is changing how is it changing because you re closer to the light and then you re when you get close it gets bigger it gets bigger and when you re far it gets littler okay why does that happen what s happening when you re down here it gets big it gets bigger why does it get bigger what happens to the light the light can t go through your hand and and and it s blocking it it s blocking more light what happens over there then it s blocking a little bit of light okay so more light gets around it right alright very good can you guys make different shadows it s a turkey that looks like the red nosed reindeer the red nosed reindeer how are you changing your shadow you have to make shapes of the animals i don t know what to make that s okay make anything you want you guys go ahead make em big and small and i ll be back in a little bit duwant is helping you duwant what s happening over here doing some measuring what are you measuring how come you guys are measuring down here and not in the window because are you able to see the box how come you re not measuring the fifth one where s the sun the sun is on the other side other side of the building way over there so we can t measure the shadow sticks today can we that s why you re making shadow sticks on the ground okay show me a shadow stick okay bristava you can handle the light what can you do can you hold the stick up for us julie to make a shadow okay can you do the measuring okay go ahead and measure it put your hand down here so we can see the top can we measure that stick no we re gonna measure the shadow you wanna measure the stick first and then compare it to the shadow okay you gotta hold that real still don t you is your light high or low low it s lower what happens if you put it lower what happens to the shadow it turns big it grows it grows it gets longer what if we put it high it s gonna be fat gonna be short is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick i need to you to measure it okay let s record it you measure the shadow measure the shadow whoops scuse me let s measure the shadow measure the shadow is that long enough or do you need another hold it still bristava is that long enough is the shadow longer or the stick longer let s compare there s the shadow measurer and there s the stick what do you notice it s the same size it s the same size it sure is what if you did it down here though would it be the same size if you put the ball down here no the shadow would be much longer wouldn t it good work guys keep measuring try a different stick use that pointer stick or another stick here s a stick here s some more sticks for you to try i m done with these things already it s okay okay what are we doing can you guys guess what that is scissors how did you know it was scissors because the shadow okay the shape of the shadow told you didn t it she put on some blocks okay no oh she says no it s not blocks is she tricking you yeah sometimes the shape is hard to tell can you guess adam no take a look at this one adam take a look at this one oh nope not from up here what do you think that is know what this is bryce what is that one can you tell from the shape what this one is gluestick a gluestick you re right good guessing how could you tell shadow of the lid you saw the shadow of the lid good job bryce s turn okay now are you guys gonna play the takeaway game okay remember she s gonna put a whole bunch of objects on there sit down and you grab a good long look and then close your eyes and she ll take one away and you ll have to guess what shadow is missing okay alright what are we doing over here guys what are we doing you re making shadows shadows you re checking out different materials yeah okay so what is that one shelby what did you find out about that one goes through what goes though what goes through the light the light goes through so does it make a shadow yes which part of it makes a shadow boys and girls check your voices please thank you this part okay that thick part makes a shadow doesn t it what about the thin parts doesn t make a shadow does it the light goes right through what else did you try what are you trying takori tell me about it show me why don t you try this trayshawn but wait takori was trying something just a minute what have you got takori a tissue it s what a tissue a tissue is the light going through it or did it stop the light stopped the light it stopped the light so it made a shadow didn t it did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow a dark one okay trayshawn your turn what are you trying the box is it stopping the light get back here so you can see put it down here can you see it what do you see about it it s making a shadow which part is making a shadow the whole thing is that a dark shadow or a light shadow a dark shadow is this part dark or light light okay why is this part light becuase it is a light shadow can t hear you babe because it s a light shadow why is it a light shadow why isn t it a dark shadow what s happening to the light some of the light going through it mm hmm what do you think cooper what s making that shadow um the light okay the light is making the shadow what are we using what is this a box okay is it clear or colored clear okay so what happens to the light it goes through okay it goes through it doesn t it so it only makes a little bit of a shadow good job did you guys write the things over here did you find anything new to write down let s try that shelby you and cooper come over here and try that okay cooper you may go to the bathroom what do you see shelby sorry you see a light shadow why is it light cause it goes right through is any part of that dark this part that part why do you think that part s dark cause it has a wrapper the wrapper and what s the wrapper doing to the light it s stopping the light and it s making a shadow exactly very good shelby thank you go right here okay what s our time we have two minutes left we might wanna go back and see hey what d we find out raja what are we doing here measuring what s your shadow doing can you change your shadow how do you change your shadow by moving by moving by moving the object how else could you change your shadow what about the light what would you do with the light move it move it i ll hold your stick and you move the light how is your shadow changing getting bigger what else could you do move your light some more move it up or down ooh what happened to the shadow it got shorter oh now what s happening got longer didn t it this is making a shadow that s easy to see look at that shadow when the light is high the shadow is shorter short and when the light is low the shadow is alright now measure that measure that how many cubes lie on that shadow one two three four five six seven is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick longer or shorter than the stick the same oh it s the same i think our,0.0
confusing for people to understand but we re looking at density today we re looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area so if you flip over to the back of your paper you ve got that little box at the top and it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density if you could write down the definition of density in your box i would appreciate that the amount of matter when i say stuff like when we were learning about solids liquids and gases at the beginning of the year stuff is matter so the amount of matter that s in a certain area is an object s density it s not its mass it s its density so the marble is more dense than the styrofoam ball okay so now that we know the word density we re going to start using the word density for the next part the amount of stuff packed in a certain area or the amount of matter the marble had more matter in that small area than the styrofoam ball the styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes making that matter more spread out less dense krayla yes right now okay all right so that was simple i want you to go ahead and put a c over your 10 at the top of this if you haven t and i want you to take a look at the part one on your paper yesterday we looked at how pressure could effect the mantle but now we need to look at something different i want you to answer number one and two first and then we ll talk about it this is just what you know before you come in my room to get you into the lesson so number one wants to know list a few things that you have seen float before number two wants to know what do you think might cause these things to float so first just make a little list of two three things that you ve seen floating before and then tell me on number two if it s a hypothesis you may not know for sure that s fine but what do you think causes them to float nathan are we allowed to write both yeah yeah so right now you re just going to make a little list on number one and then number two you re going to tell me what do you think actually causes these things that you wrote down to be able to float we re going to start with that first this is just to get us thinking about what we re doing today one and two please what do you think causes them to float you might not be sure of the answer to number two but i still want you to make a hypothesis you don t have to write i think because but you can tell me what you think causes that number two s going to be harder than number one yeah let s take four things tell me four things that you ve seen float before we ll take four because we can probably sit here and name like 100 cole give me one ice cubes ice cubes sadie boat a boat alex shoes shoes and emily dog toy dog toys okay now we know things can float and that s great but what do you think causes these things to float why do you think dog toys and a boat and ice cubes and things like that why are they are going to be able to float ebony what do you think the air in them the amount of air that s in them anybody else dylan they are less dense okay sean surface tension surface tension little air pockets that are in them okay air pockets i was thinking like the less density inside of it okay alright we re going to take a look at that today so you ve got a kind of idea we re going to look at what causes something to sink and what effects if something floats alright we have two parts that we are going to be going to our last stations for so let s take a look at part two last station observation you have two setups at your lab station you have a black tray that has three objects in it you ve got a bouncy ball a marble and a styrofoam ball alright you also have a setup at your lab station that has liquids in cups this is for part three alright i don t want you touching this stuff yet we re going to come back later and you re going to look at that stuff i don t want any of the cups knocked over i don t want any of the objects put into the cups okay these two things are separate your black tray and the piece of paper with the cups are separate what you re going to do first is use the black tray and the objects in it you re going to tell me with the marble the bouncy ball and the styrofoam ball if we were to put these in water which we are going to test them but if we were to put these in water do you think these objects would sink or float so you just go through and if you want you can just write an f or an s you re going to say what you think and i want you to wait until you get to your lab stations so you can pick them up feel them to see that might make a difference in your guess then i also want you to tell me why while you are at your lab station float or sink in water and why you re not going to do the did it actually float because we re going to look at that when we come back these are our results so you re going to do the first two columns float or sink why float or sink why float or sink why then we are going to come to that and we are going to come back and we re going to do an observation together so these two columns have got to be filled out before you get back to your seats got it let s go marble sink rubber float rubber float styrofoam float the marble will probably sink it s heavy it has no air in it bouncy ball the bouncy ball probably can float yeah i mean it s not light it s gonna float bouncy ball same thing bouncy ball heavy marble heavy with no air pockets no this one will definitely float because it s lightweight and it has these little pores this bounces a lot his bounces a little bit and this bounces not at all yeah but this one but this one if this one can float then why not think that one could float okay if you don t go with your group that s okay but you still need to a connection if you are finished before the timer goes off you need to come back to your seat this will float this will fall fail if you finish you need to come back to your seats you guys all finished i want to go ahead and take a look before we see the results before we look at the results and test this i want to see what we think so first off let s start with the marble since it s at the top raise your hand if you think the marble will float okay so we re all together on this one it s not going to float who can tell me why they re thinking it s not going to float we ll take like three guesses three explanations jc it s heavy with no air pockets heavy with no air pockets good frayla it can t capture air it can t float can t capture air can t float alright and emma heavy and solid heavy and solid alright now what about the bouncy ball raise your hand if you think this is going to float alright there s a mix what that s heavier than the marble well let s hear somebody give me an explanation for why it would float if you guessed float tell me why you thought that sean because there s air inside okay there s air inside alex i dropped it in the pond and it still floated bouncy ball floated in the pond when you did it before ali i ve seen it happen okay you ve seen it happen now some of us said it would sink why did you say it would sink matt weaver because it s heavy it s heavy frayla okay jared okay so prior experience now last one is our styrofoam ball float raise your hand alright somebody give me a reason why it s going to float we re all together on this one too we all agree the marble is going to sink we all agree the styrofoam ball is going to float matt cook it s light and has air pockets it s light and has air pockets alex you re talking alot of things the pond was last time okay frayla it s very lightweight okay alright let s test it out we re just going to test it out upfront here so i m just going to use this big beaker what do we want to see first marble bouncy ball alright record sink for your actual i guess we ll do bouncy ball we ll just go in order alright bouncy ball ready the moment of truth and styrofoam ball yeah a different bouncy ball didn t float but you saw the bouncy ball i was using right yeah so it was fair right yeah very simple but let s take a look at what s going on for number four i d like you to tell me i want you to answer first and then we ll discuss what i d like you to tell me why do you think some of these objects were able to float while others were able to sink and i want you to be specific at the beginning i asked you the same question on number two in prior knowledge why do you think some of these things float i want you to revisit that question again so why do you think the marble and the bouncy ball sank and the styrofoam ball was floating i want you to be specific on number four i want you to answer first on your paper and then we re going to share okay what kinds of things did we say for number four now that we ve looked at this in a different way before i just asked you to think of things in your past that you ve seen float now we ve looked at our marble our bouncy ball and our styrofoam ball what did you say nick bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up and it was too heavy okay anybody else say anything nick said bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up so it sank anybody say something different ebony density and buoyancy all right what do you mean density and buoyancy okay frayla i said that some objects had air holes and some were just solid okay now let s think of this in a different way we ve got this really small marble and we ve got a much larger styrofoam ball so normally if something s smaller you think it s going to be lighter it should float something heavier this is much larger but it didn t sink if i have one book if i m carrying one book versus carrying five books that s different because five books are bigger than one book so what is going on with the amount of stuff in the marble and the amount of stuff in the styrofoam ball is it the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space does the marble have the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space that the styrofoam ball does which one has more stuff more matter in a smaller space i want you to talk with the person sitting next to you for one minute okay so we ve done this before okay so marble s number one styrofoam ball two which object has more stuff more matter packed in a smaller space on the count of three right here marble one styrofoam ball two one two three marble good marble so let s write that down this is pretty much what number five is asking you so when comparing the marble to the styrofoam ball which one has more mass more matter more stuff in a smaller amount of space which we call volume that would be the marble alright people today if you flip over to the next part i ve heard the word density a couple times and density is kind of,0.0
okay so if you re having trouble seeing it you can go back in with a regular pencil brush visible enough for you you can go back in and make it lighter but right now the mark makings you re doing is really good as you want to turn if you re having trouble making curved lines you can turn oh okay all right that helps instead of turning the tool turn the plate and keep pulling towards you okay it might make it a little bit easier to make those curves yeah they re really tough to do other than that it s been fine good is that working now that you what we talked about yesterday with this little yeah shadow i thought it was kind of okay and the same thing that i just told kim if you re having trouble with the curved lines you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve all right but so far what you re doing is good you re adding all these different values continue with that type of texture on the edges because that s working i m just going that s okay be patient have you decided yet how you re gonna treat this area in here no i m probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing okay so adding a different texture are you leaving the text i never i forgot to reprint it so if i do decide you ll just have to reverse the text yeah i know and i ll right add it in that s fine i think i ll just decide it later yeah finish your whole overall design first yes exactly and then if you want the text in it as long as it s reversed so you print it the right way yeah you can just reprint it okay sounds good awesome yeah so you re just yeah all right the way you re doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it s consistent do i have to make it identical no well what do you think are these identical persons it s like supposed to be but i know i m not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but i think it would look fine if it was different i kinda want it to look a little messy you want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one i don t think there s anything wrong with making them separate i know that they re trying to be echoing each other symmetrically yeah but all of the textures can be different okay to add some interest to it i think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side right don t you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway yeah definitely that s good how did you decide that you re going to treat the inside of the mouth area are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light well there s supposed to be some tongue over here but over here i m gonna make it like i m gonna try to go solid black in some parts like i tried to do that inside the mouth yeah that s good that s good i want mine to seem so then all of those areas then will stay dark yeah it ll create a nice shadow excellent that s really good are you gonna go off the edge yeah nice that s really good keep it up and emily how s yours coming yeah the same thing all those little dark areas that you re working on inside in between teeth now that you ve carved out all that area it s gonna create a darkened tone and as i mentioned before all the different stippling areas that s really good it s adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure if you re finding that it s easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table okay good good this is good i m getting confused of where i m going because if i did the backgrounds this is the negative space that i do the crosshatching then it would have to continue down here so you want to decide all the different types of textures that you re using in between all of it yeah all right so you ve got a little bit of the crosshatching here okay and you re using illustrative lines over here so you wanna try and find something in between that s a little bit different right uh huh well you haven t done any stippling texture yet i was working on in here okay so in here s gonna be stippling so right then this can t be the stippling because it s gonna be next to it i was thinking of here kind of moving this pattern down and then maybe just sort of okay i think that would be a good solution to that it s like this area in the background okay now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid and then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture you can go back into it and add it again okay okay so in here like you said follow the movement of these objects okay this is all the chain inside the bike so following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture and then in here just because you have all this texture in here you might not need to put anything else there okay what s your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra yeah it s hard to tell because i m not sure how it s gonna look when it s printed but i think that might be good because it would get kind of crazy i think it might be nice to have and you wanna still have it have a focal point so if you go crazy with other textures in here you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work okay i m having a hard time seeing it so you i might need to get one of those blue sheets okay the blue sheets are working i think you know what emily s been using the table so maybe that helps her to see her white lines that has been helping so if you don t wanna use one of those blue sheets you can do what she s doing and use the table yeah i ll do that i think i wanna lift it off of the book so you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines okay okay you re still working on your design right yeah i think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon yeah because once you figure out what s going on over here yeah i just have to yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong so what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas are you gonna fill them in too yeah i think so okay then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it engraving it i don t know i don t know if i should do really fine crosshatching mm hmm but then should i put a new texture on these what do you think do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print because i think if i texture both of them it ll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture okay so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first you can decide if they re too solid then you can go back in with a different texture okay okay so finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later okay room 221 students enter through a small entryway to their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom this classroom is shared by two teachers storage space is limited in this room i teach three sections of photography advanced placement studio art and advanced placement art history as we open up into the main part of the classroom storage areas are visible for each class photographic prints a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives as i pan the room you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible bulletin boards are set up for project instructions visual examples and critique displays along the back of the room is a dry mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies in the center of the room the printing press is stored for ap studio art and set up to allow for safe and organized used along the right hand side of the room there is a drawing rack for students to store work in progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives there is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents the file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders the large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies and at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept and at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use the projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions some of you are ready to print so i wanted to go through the actual printing press process today some of you might even be ready to try that today if you re not ready to try it right after i do the demonstration you can go back to your etching or engraving and then by tomorrow you ll be able to run it through the press before i do that i wanted to share something with you that s a little exciting and the fact that i actually have a relative who was a professional engraver my grandfather was an engraver he started in the 1930s and 40s after world war ii he was part of something called the gi bill does anybody know what that is oh i do yeah what is it they pay people to go to college yes exactly yeah after the world war ii veterans came back from war the government paid for them to go to college and he went to a college called the art students league which i was just talking with alex about and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver i m going to pass some of these around these are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you you can take some of those so you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time a hundred years at least or even more but this is from the early 30s and 40s these engravings and these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that i explained that we don t do here because of the safety you re doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid so i m going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that i m passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we re working with today and it s kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this so i m going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him all right so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print making ink so for the most part we re going to start with black today but you can choose any color that you want so you can see some of the examples that i put up here from past students one student decided instead of putting black ink on the white ground he used white ink on black ground so that s another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process so all the steps that we re going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week it s going to remind you of all the steps so the first step after you ve beveled all the edges in your plate that i demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print making ink and all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you re ready you ll take a little bit of print making ink and put it on the plate like this just like that and you ll use a tool called a brayer and the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate so once your brayer is filled with the ink you ll apply it to the plate and i m actually using my grandfather s plate from several years ago all right so you ll gently apply the ink over the entire plate okay just take a seat and i ll hand it out all right and after you have the entire plate inked you ll check and make sure that you didn t miss any spots all right notice that i missed a spot there so i m going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered once you have all the areas covered and this is just in interest of time i ll just show you the next step once the entire plate is covered you ll take a small piece of mat board i ll just use this instead okay i have little pieces of mat boards for you okay so you re going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that i have cut up here after you apply the entire ground with ink you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that s going to be on your inside lines this has a dual purpose it removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate this has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you re done this will push all the ink in the surface okay and then once you get most of it removed then you can take the cheesecloth i found one of my mat boards here we go all right so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink and then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front this will lift the ink off pretty easily and after you do this process this is the messy process so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you re done with this before we move to the printing press i ll show you how to do that sometimes a circular motion with this will help so i m going to show so you can all see circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface i m showing you this quickly all the steps but i have one prepared for us to print with just like a cooking show so it s ready to go all right so you re going to use flat on the table i m showing you this so you can see it but you re going to do all of this flat at your desk get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth if you run out of space you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again then the last step before you clean your edges at this point if you want to go clean your hands so you don t get it on anything again you could go clean your hands as well we ll take a piece of newsprint a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper the newsprint works the best so i have cut up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice smooth surface and before you re ready to print you could take a q tip dip it in some water and then clean your edges so the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates you should take the q tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean so this print was left up here for a reason it doesn t have a clean edge i wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn t clean their edge okay this has a nice clean edge this has a little bit of ink left on the edge so when you pull a perfect print you want to make sure you have a clean edge and the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off,0.0
like learning is supposed to be a privilege not a burden it s like supposed to be like that s why we re america we have the choice you re not supposed to be forced to do it okay um but like about them picking a random person they might they might not just go pick a random person if they have to vote because if they have to vote then they re gonna go see that candidate candidate s political beliefs are and what he or she is gonna do for the country okay trevor but if um they re not gonna know which one to pick if they re not educated or don t know about the person okay what if they don t know how to read in their researching they don t know how to read okay do you want me to say my question yeah go ask your question okay um if only like when we don t have the law only 60 percent vote so how is that supposed to show what america really wants how is that supposed to show what president we want and what choices we wanna do but if we do get the other 40 percent that already don t wanna vote then they would just pick one and that still wouldn t be the the will of the big united states and outta the 60 percent votes you could just make your uh votes outta that what do you mean like the people that did vote just choose a person who did get the most votes but we wanna see what america as a whole really wants not what a little over half of america wants um our founding fathers vote for the right to vote for for freedom and so i think we should use that wisely okay elaborate on that a little bit say that one more time um if our founding fathers vote for the right to or fought for the right to freedom then i think we should use that correctly so you think that if the founding fathers looked at this law they would say this is not what we meant when we said you know we want people to vote for our leaders they didn t want us to force people they still wanted it to be a freedom didn t we like like have the law for like trying to get the opinion of the whole population of america the other 40 percent it still wouldn t be like their decision because they would just pick one they wouldn t really care so they re not really getting any difference by not having the law but we re not forcing them to do that we re forcing them to help america so you re forcing them okay jackson can you respond to that point um yes if you like if we don t force people to vote then maybe the poor just can t make it there and if we say oh you have to vote then we then we could like provide them transporation to get to there also if poor people won t vote that means rich people will vote and they ll just vote for the person who they believe is gonna keep them rich and that they d not go against that do you think that that represents the majority of americans if only those wealthy or at least middle to upper class people are voting no no because if the poor people don t vote they re already poor that s already bad enough and they don t get to voice their opinion and in a democracy too that s just even worse and that s a big segment of people right so you re saying that really a lot of these people maybe it s that it s not that they don t want to vote it s that they don t have the opportunity we need to provide some more public um opportunities like opportunities like public transportation to allow them to vote to make it easier okay cause it s not only poor and uneducated people it s just people that really don t care that much and like when making those people vote like kind of what she said they could most a lot of em could try and break the law if you force them to vote because they just don t want to and they really don t care and like if there s somebody who has who doesn t care but they re being forced to vote and they have a really busy job and they have a lot going on they wouldn t have time to research or anything and so they could they would just have to go out there when they did have to vote they d just vote for someone cause they never had any time to do any research or look at something about the people to vote for okay let s come back to that point cause i think we still have some questioners who haven t asked their question who s who s up next jaylen um you say there are different ways to give them their complete and to vote but what are those ways what d she say well if you have things hold on let me let me make sure they heard what you re saying say it again but say it louder okay um i say it s different ways to get them to vote but what are those ways that you get them to vote does anybody have a ready response for that i can t hear her she s saying you guys are saying there are better ways than compulsory voting laws there s other and better ways so what are those ways like just because they re poor doesn t mean they can t know that like you can like hang up posters or like get someone to hand out flyers or something it doesn t have to be all electronic i m not talking about poor people well she s saying it could help anybody really but okay respond well but there are poor people that wanna vote they don t have a chance to excuse me well hold on hold on a second hold on hold on cause i i m not sure that y all are understand what her point is say your point again um with some passion with passion cause that ll make your point just scream at her what are different ways that you can get the american people to vote besides besides posters because a poster s not gonna it s compulsory voting and besides these laws what are some better ways to make people vote well y all keep sayin go and like pick up people and providing transportation well instead of doing that to make them vote you might as well just do that so that they might have the opportunity to vote rather than having to vote so you don t necessarily have to have these laws to still provide some public services to encourage people to vote okay and like we all know that we get those like very long phone calls that are like vote for this person because they re gonna do all this stuff and like that then like someone who gets that phone call could actually think about it and then like maybe i should vote for that person and you see the big billboard thingies that have the big names on it and all the signs in the yards and so that could make you think well maybe i should go vote since all these people are saying we should vote for that person so you you think they should have an increase in in publicizing elections we should we should have more advertising when elections come up okay okay well if you were to like have election um that would like cost a lot of money to have like a lot of um transportation going around so um and it s like not a lot of people are gonna use that transportation then why just like so why not just make them vote cause they already have public transportation out there okay let s top on that one we ll come back to it because we ve got one more question uh if we didn t require people to vote what would happen if what would happen if like nobody voted decided to vote say that one more time if we didn t require people to vote what would happen if like nobody decided to vote or a small majority of people okay well people have different opinions like some people think that we put a voice out into the government and say what we want and then some people think like that we that every vote counts and basically there s like five three million people in america and i don t think every single one of them would not vote okay any other responses but we already have 60 percent voting i mean and so we know every some people are going to vote it s just the people who don t care about politics and just like when we had the survey people a lot of people didn t vote for the midterm election but on the other hand some people did we re always gonna have a group that doesn t vote and a group that is voting and if you make them vote they re not gonna care even as more as they did when they weren t voting okay i m gonna go ahead and open up the floor because we ve asked all the questions so pretty much anybody can answer or ask but let s try and keep it on the same topic so if you are raising your hand make sure you re responding to what the last person said okay uh let s see connor oh like you said every vote counts but like we need more people to vote so we know that like we know the exact number of like who is going to be the president or in the house of representatives or the senate so that theres a better chance that they will get elected okay so we need a more accurate portrayal of what people think we need more people to vote so we really know what americans think okay well i agree with connor but going back to what everybody over there is saying they re all saying oh they they won t care they wont they wont care or anything and they wont pay attention to what happens but i mean if we can make like some kind of exception for like special needs people for the deaf and blind and then um also we can get people to stand out in front of a booth and once they ll go get there you can do a speech about both candidates and their ups and downs okay so you re saying actually have people at the voting polls that are kind of breaking down the two sides maybe for those people who didn t take the time to research it okay um one of y all keep sayin we keep sayin that they might not care but like in actuality if you if someone doesn t care and you force them to care not only is that kinda like convincing like brainwashing them it s also if you force someone to do something they re not going to want to anymore so that wouldn t be helping anything so you re saying it s it s gonna actually make them more bitter toward voting if you force them to do it okay and someone said that it s gonna be for the good of the country for making them vote but if they could choose a bad a bad person cause it wouldn t be for the good of the country then okay so if you force them to vote and then they go and vote for a bad person that s not gonna be helping the country at all okay jason um like um you could um for those people that can t vote or um you could put the they could put the polls the voting polls near where those people uh live and um so that they could like if they can t drive there in a car they could just walk there because it d only be like maybe a block down their way okay you could like open a public train like so they don t have to pay to go as much and then make it free yeah for that day okay alexandra what do you think alright um well like making people vote is gonna make them more interested in like the country and then they ll actually care cause like they re not gonna wanna like break a law and so then they re gonna actually care about the country and so they won t just be choosing a random person they re gonna actually start caring and start thinking about who they should choose you really think if if we force them to vote then they they will become more interested in politics and they ll go out and research it okay like just like if you make some make everyone vote then it s really not gonna change their opinion they re still gonna have like they re still gonna not really care as much as the person that would go out and vote without being forced so you re really not getting an accurate number of what they think they want because they still just because you re making them vote doesn t mean they re gonna necessarily pick the right person okay um they re always saying like that we still have this 40 percent that haven t voted well everyone like even the poor people and the uneducated well everyone knows that there s a presidential election or some kind of election going on you can t it s like impossible to not know about it and so really it s their choice that they didn t vote most of the people who aren t poor but they re like middle class like they won t make the choice to vote if okay so you re a lot of people have made the choice to vote so you re saying the presidential election everybody knows about it everybody probably has an opinion because it s all over the place so and 40 percent are not obviously those 40 percent know that they don t wanna go and vote they ve chosen not to vote most of them have chosen not to vote okay you know i have to disagree with you when you say that if we just tell people to vote they ll just pick a random person what i think is that if people are being told to vote they ll just go in there and say well if i m being told to vote i just might as well just pick someone good you d think that they would actually try and think about something before they vote like the term look before you leap so you think if they have to go to the effort of voting they re at least gonna think about it they re at least gonna form an opinion okay um like you put of um you you could like make the offices make the person take the day off and like sort of give them the day off and that s,0.0
like the chocolate one with the strawberries that we looked at that is going to serve approximately 24 people so if you multiple that by two that s approximately 48 that you should charge if you re going to charge for your cakes now it s going to depend on did you really put that much time energy and effort into it and do you feel like you really need to charge that that s going to have a little bit of basis to how much you are going to charge but that will kind of give you an idea what to charge for your cakes think about it too serving sizes for cakes are typically two inches square they re small so when you are thinking but that s a little cake well serving size is tiny it s not that you are going to serve them a whole meal out of cake it s just for them to get a taste sculpted cakes like the catfish cake that we looked at 100 plus when i looked these up specifically for something as big as that catfish cake because it was a pretty good size catfish cake we tried to make it as realistic as possible and it was about this tall so probably somewhere at 150 200 level had we bought that at a bakery the wedding cake like jessie s wedding cake that we ve seen somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 because it was a seven tiered masterpiece as well who has a question come on somebody has got a question i wanna make a 3d cake okay when do you wanna make one i don t know they re fun so if you were going to make a 3d cake what would you make catfish okay britney s making a catfish okay erica s making a dinosaur oh my favorite piggies butterflies what else what would you like to try penguin duck basketball panda bear would be cute a tire brandi i wanna see your tire cake when you get that done a monkey would be fun that would be really cute so you guys are starting to think 3d we need to be thinking about your roses too because we gotta work on those roses and get that technique down let s go over to our table and i ll show you about making those roses okay so when we get our snow day tomorrow i expect you to go home and practice practice practice practice practice if it s snow we probably will get out watch facebook brandi or listen to the news that s how we ll find out i always post it to my facebook whenever they tell us you guys already know about fixing your pastry bags and this one is already fixed and it s all ready to go you know me i like wrapping it up one of my just little tricks i like to use for this if it starts getting sticky on the outside which actually i know you have struggled with this these are not my friends these are my friends that s my first tip my second tip is if you re going to use a plastic bag take a paper towel and just turn it into your handle and the other thing is don t fill your bag so full it really only needs to be filled to about halfway maybe a little bit more than halfway okay then what you ll do is you ll start rolling it down as you re rolling it down typically what i do first is i fold it in kind of at a triangle then i start rolling it down the reason for that is so when i start putting pressure on it s got both those folds and then another fold to keep it from escaping other people like to do the toothpaste thing and twist it s totally up to you how you want to do that either one is totally acceptable just feel what works best for you okay then i make my little handle out of my paper towel remember on the tips you will notice on the tips especially the wilton tips has a number that number is representative of how big the hole is the larger the number the larger the hole that works on the writing tips someone tell me what number is on that one okay tell me what number is on that one erica it s on the outside okay yours is a number 12 five you ve got a number five it says a 230 okay a 230 one okay and why a one what a one m that means one monster no i don t know what the m stands for what is the difference though between this tip and this tip they re pretty much the same thing what would you use this one for for big cakes or for wait don t i got this you ve got it okay come on ashley what would you use it for borders borders yes great answer absolutely i m telling you by the time you have finished your masterpiece and you re ready to do the borders get the big ones cause you re ready to be done with it if you pick one of these little teeny tiny ones by that time you re sick of working with frosting and you re ready to do something else but this one s just a number 16 see how tiny that is okay rose tips the bigger the number the bigger the holes also on your rose tip make sure that the large opening end is going down if this is awkward for you all you have to do to adjust your tip loosen it and then twist it around and then tighten your tip you don t want to tighten it so much that it s gonna take a pair of pliers to get it loose okay let s see if i can get this back in business okay you ve got your rose nails you re just going to put a little squirt of frosting and it doesn t have to be very big and i m making a big mess now hold it down lay it straight down on your waxed paper and now you ve got your basis for your rose this is what we re gonna build the roses on we have to make a pyramid of frosting to start out with remember that on the power point the first one i m gonna do is i m gonna rotate this counter clockwise and make my little pyramid see that little circle in the middle that s going to be the very inside of the rosebud actually you could pull these off after you let them set up stick them on a plate or on a cookie sheet stick them in the freezer and you could have lots of little rosebuds to set on your cake just add your little leaves add your little vines and make you a really pretty little rosebush out of that if you want it a little bit bigger you just squeeze and rotate all at the same time it s about pressure and release so if you wanted a little rose you would pull it off right about now if you want a little bit bigger we re gonna build it up my frosting is getting warm but that s okay there s a little bit bigger one it s starting to flop over on me because it s getting really warm in here the more petals you add to the outside the bigger your rose is going to be did you see that it just about flew onto the floor could you tell me what this would be used for yes that one is actually to decorate cupcakes so if we had a whole bunch of cupcakes this is so you can do some really delicate work inside the very delicate areas like if you have them all lined up and you re trying to do them really fast you can just do that usually what they will do that for is you know the little curly things that look like a little snake on the top have you seen them they just go shhhhh that s what they use that for it kind of is fun one other way that you can do your frosting pyramid is just go straight down and squeeze and just bring it straight up so now we ve got our cute little middle of our cute little rose going yeah it sticks straight up and we re just gonna wrap our little petals around it there we go see how cute that is it looks just like one that you just picked right off my little rosebush some of my white roses at home look like that that one is cute that one s a good one let s see if i can finish this off we ll do this one tiny the smaller you want to make them you just add a smidge of pressure instead of a lot of pressure if you add a lot of pressure you re gonna make a big rose it is it s getting really warm who has a question about making these cute little roses okay and i know you guys are masters at using your little star tips for shell borders all right so lets see what you can do i think you got your tables set who would like to use this tip simone do you need a rose tip okay i ll come around and check on you and see how you re doing i want to see your masterpieces i wanna see a couple of good roses from each of you kimberly do you all need a rose tip over here do you need that okay sorry let me get out of your way do we just do one or two i want you to practice your borders and i want you to practice your rose tips so if you have a rose tip at your table you ll probably have to share i ll come around and check on you and see how it s going and if you have any problems or questions let me know i have a question that is a good question it should be but it s not don t use this one this works best if you take your bag and just snip it and just drop it straight back in the bag because this coupler is not designed to fit on this particular one i ll get you a different one you can try brandi have you used the super star one that makes have you used the leaf tip yet no let s try leaves the big giant one this will not fit on here with your coupler you ll have to use a different frosting bag most everything else that s out you can use this one actually you might have fun with this one this one makes swirlies cool it just makes lines you just zigzag it all the star tips are right here err not the star but the rose no i think all of them are out you guys will have to wait and trade out with each other yep they re all out i just suck at this no you don t let me see start with this christina hold your handle handles are our friends ooh it looks like a square rose it does look like a square rose that s cool okay britney make sure the big end goes to the bottom the small end goes to the top remember your angles too 45 and these to brandi and i ll be right back brandi here how do i make this one work oh this one is kind of fun this one quite literally is something you d finish off like if you re making grass you just kind of swirl it around you can do it like this yeah there are two lines like if you wanted to do ziggy zags you can do circles you know like that it s all about your pressure oh what happened what happened they re laughing at my rose what s wrong with it that s a good start keep building on it now remember leticia this big part right here on this side that goes down there you go if it s not in the right location you may want to unscrew this and realign this try that see if that works better for ya then remember you re twisting all at the same time you re making like upside down u s remember oh you did miss that part of the lesson too didn t you all right let me show you and then i ll let you do one okay what you re gonna do this big one always goes down you re making like an upside down u just like that you re gonna u and turn it all at the same time so that it s a slow turn and this motion all at the same time okay then when you re done you just set that aside and do another one show me what you re doing there you go hold it just like that that s good hey you re getting there you re making a pyramid of frosting and you can do it one of two ways you can either do it this way or straight up and down just make a big glob of frosting and turn this all at the same time there you go just like that pull your frosting off there you go okay now that s a good start and now you re gonna start making your upside down u s usually you have three on your bottom layer there you go you re turning it all at the same time it s all about the hand motion there you go just like that just make little tiny ones all around there ya go that looks good there ya go see you can do this leticia there oh look how beautiful that is it is oh my gosh that s a perfect rosebud thank you that s it that s all you have to do the bigger you wanna make your rose the more levels you put around the outside edge okay if that s all you want then pull it off set it aside and do some more that s it all right you ve got the techniques and you know what to do i ll come back and check on you yes yes yes yes oh come on show me show me show me at least it s better than theirs hey you re getting there i think you re doing the same thing that leticia was doing see this big piece you ve got it back it needs to go down if this is awkward for you and you need to twist this part of it just unscrew and re navigate britney that looks good wait it is on bottom now it is now because i just turned it when you were doing it it wasn t see how these are heavy on top that s the reason it ll be okay do you need some more is there anymore cut out things no but there s stuff to do it all right i ll come back and check on you sierra i m gonna leave you in charge over here if they need some help let me know okay okay good job where are you over here yes yes yes yes star borders deluxe okay so how are you doing you re doing really good on those leaf tips have you tried any standing up so you know how to do that literally you start here and you pull straight up on it at a 90 degree angle what just like that like that sometimes they roll over the stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they are see how you can get them to stand up just like that or if you want them to lay on the side if you go slow they stay up faster yeah and it has to do with the consistency of your frosting too remember what you put in it to make it a little bit thicker powdered sugar or you can do what there you go sarah sarah i have never seen don t look a big no no oh man that s good frosting okay all right yell at me i stuck my thumb in it i had to lick it off it s really good by the way it is don t do as i do do as i say that s kind of like momma s say ya know i m your school momma it s not monkey see monkey do it s monkey do what monkey say i m telling ya today it s ms morris is doing something silly all right so sarah show me another one show me some shell borders cause i know you ve practiced those she will she ll be i ll be back that s cute that s very stylish now the tip that ashley has the one that looks like the little grass that s got the two holes at the same time if you re gonna do something real fancy if you ll do this one white and then put a colored one in there and do it back and forth it will kinda look like this holly try it again try again where s the leaf leddy s got one of them do you guys have one okay show her what to do it s pressure and release pressure and release that one actually turned out really good that one is a very good leaf when you re working on your leaves for your cake this is what you want it to look like if they start breaking off like this you ll probably want to scrape them off it s just a matter of the pressure and release thing but those are looking really really good i know i m gonna sneeze too okay maybe i m not bless you hey mariah show me what you can do oh come on those are good ones those are cute that s a cute border samantha you re doing a really good job on that too kailyn that is awesome so have you practiced at home yet no why not i figured you would be i figured you would be practicing every chance you got no i don t have time what do you mean you don t have time yeah drew told me you re working on your scrapbook good job brandi all right show me something that you can do i wanna see somebody make a rose i showed you how now i wanna see them yes i wanna see you make a rose make another one oh let me you can use my frosting i ll bring you some look you did it so what is the rule,0.0
where do i have more potential energy at position a or position b matt position a why because it s fully stopped before it s there it s already moving a little bit what else why does this point here point a have more potential energy than point b so this is a this is b does everyone agree that position a has more potential energy raise your hand if you agree with that okay now who can tell me why why does position a have more potential energy than position b it has more potential to do work why has potential to do work yes why it has a greater height it has a greater height who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class i did okay so going back to gpe when you have a pendulum swinging back and forth types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy and potential energy specifically we can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy if you focus your attention here what is that a pendulum a pendulum similar to what you have here actually you guys within the next week you ll actually be working with the simulation it s effect simulation they re online they re free for you to use and they re nice because they allow you to play i know you like to a play a lot i like to play yes matt you will be working with this but i just wanted to show you another application of this just in a different format when we swing the pendulum what s going to happen it s gonna move it s going to move and at point here and here let s say a and b what type of energy is being represented potential potential energy who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented you wanna come up sure between a and b so every place along the path between a and b does everyone agree with ali yes yes okay where is gravitational potential energy at its max wanna go up and point at points a and b right so everyone agree on the two ends where would kinetic energy be at its max where is kinetic energy at its max right here why because it s lowest what else so we said here let s label this point c we already used a and b why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here that s when the potential energy is at its lowest great that s where potential energy the gravitational potential energy is at its lowest and if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula what does the formula state what variables involved in the kinetic energy formula matt mass and velocity mass and velocity what can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it s swinging along its path back and forth from a to b what can we infer about the kinetic energy it s terminal velocity is well we re not gonna say terminal velocity the object isn t falling it s attached what can we conclude about the velocity at point c any thoughts garrett greatest it s at its greatest when the pendulum is at this point it stops at each point a and b our two end points it stops for a split second because it has to do what maddy did you say it turn around it has to turn around when it swings back down what s happening to the velocity is it increasing or decreasing increasing so if the velocity is increasing what s gonna happen to the kinetic energy value it s also going to increase now if i show you a graphical representation who can describe the graphical representation like a downward okay ali as it moves i guess it swings back and forth the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point it s the highest and then when it reaches points a and b the potential energy gets highest so does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with yes yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy i can stop it at certain areas sometimes it comes out better than others it is somewhat on its way back but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy and if i m really good i can maybe try and get it in the middle close enough it s hard to stop it right in the center but you notice that the potential energy does what decreases and your kinetic energy will increase increase rather and you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point c one other factor that s involved here there is one other type of energy or form of energy that s involved can anyone think of it celini thermal thermal energy mechanical mechanical thermal thermal garrett you had your hand up thermal thermal who agrees with thermal raise your hand wait actually no is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum no that s mechanical thermal if you re saying thermal energy what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum what is the pendulum doing right now it s moving through the air air when objects move through the air what can occur or what is present air resistance which is a form of friction friction is or is not friction an example of heat energy is or thermal energy yes so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present yes yes now how come it s not showing up on the graph there s no friction there s no friction so what i like about this and like i said you guys will be using the simulation and one of the options you have is to change the value for friction right now i have no friction so it s not showing up on the grid so if i increase the friction you re going to see how the value for thermal energy will change also when you apply or work with the simulation you can actually change the mass of the ball or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself and those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days so let s add some friction let s go about halfway what s happening to the friction it s increasing it s increasing on every swing it s increasing with every swing and the pendulum is not reaching points a and b anymore and the what it s not reaching points a and b anymore why what s happening here we have all these types of forms of energy what s happening the air resistance slowing it down the air resistance could be slowing it down want a little more falls away lots of friction and what s gonna happen ali losing particles it s not losing particles i m not losing any mass we re not changing the mass we re not changing the particles if there s a great deal of friction it s losing energy it slows down does it lose energy how many of you think it loses energy raise your hand how many of you think otherwise what happens to the energy that was present we had colorful bars matt said it s colorful we had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy now we have these great big red bars representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now what happened in this simulation ali i don t know that but because in the definition of thermal energy that s the total potential or kinetic energy in an object so there is potential and kinetic energy involved yes steven you wanna try and help him out the energy gets transferred to thermal exactly the energy gets transferred to thermal energy what does the word transfer mean or transform what does that mean you know the movie transformers you guys are not too young for that right i had a transformer i did jessica it changes it changes if we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened what could we say that we learned about the energies involved what would be the main concept the thing you just learned which steven and jessica proceeded what happened to the energies who can restate what they just stated matt or maybe give a definition energy is transferred but not lost okay energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost so what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy would you agree with that statement raise your hand if you agree and what does the word transform mean bella change good change so you changed we began with what kind of energy at this position elaine potential potential ailsa it changed to kinetic kinetic it changed to potential potential changed back to kinetic kinetic and we also have some thermal energy involved is everyone clear on that concept what you re going to do with your group get out a sheet of paper a piece of scrap paper or you could use the back of your packet is fine there s a blank spot on there one paper per group per group okay what you re going to do i m showing you two objects i brought in props for you guys today real life this is my toaster from home aw is it a brave little toaster what i want you to do you have two examples stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in it is turned on the blades are moving what i want you to do to these two objects i want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects but what i want you to do is take it a step further i want you to tell me or place in order what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed so you begin with you might have a thought what type of energy do i begin with in order for the toaster to work what type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on and i want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation you re gonna get about two to three minutes to do this i would like every person in the group to participate you all should be able to share your ideas freely respect what other people are saying and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies any questions before you begin any questions okay see it like stops here like that s potential energy and well if you look at the fan i purposely turned it on so the blades are doing what they re moving are they doing work yes base your forms or types of energy on what you see the blades are moving it is turning okay if you want to list the energy you begin with put an arrow put the next form of energy put an arrow put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that s involved with the two objects is it turning right now do you all agree on that i would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that wait wait wouldn t they both be nuclear energy nuclear energy yes because it s think about your definition of here you put the energy for toaster i would write it down sucked in i don t have the jolt in that look i don t have the toaster plugged in don t burn yourself but let s look and observe three of you do you feel anything yes do you see all those little black pointy things when you put something in there and you turn it on i don t know what you call those things but they like the coil yeah the coil yeah yes they do that s how you generate the heat if you had the toast it would turn on how about in the oven coils inside what colors do they turn orange they turn orange the same thing they turn orange so do you think that there s a form of energy involved here yeah magnetic that s right oh but you discovered it on your own,0.0
ah okay okay suri does this only happens in vinegar or can it happen in water try it tomorrow we re going to experiment more with this okay this is can i have your attention up here again i m just trying to help you by sharing observations i hear when i go around the room somebody had a question and i love questions they said does this happen when you put it in water the same way that it happens if you put it in vinegar because i have told you all it s vinegar if you have questions like that could you please write them on the side so that i know what investigations you d like to do in the future so we can because we re going to be continuing this now once you ve made all of your observations you still have that column like we ve had from every little activity today that says what could be happening so let me be more specific i want you to tell me again the title of the lab is where s the matter i want you to tell me where that tablet went i want you to look at your observations i want you to be specific and i want you to tell me where s the matter what happened to the tablet okay in that last column you should only have one box to fill in please discuss it with your lab group and write down where it went what happened to it and then we ll all discuss it together it can do both can t it so you think it turned into a gas you think it dissolved and turned into a gas okay so you can absolutely write both next thing we re going to talk about is how we prove that so if any of you guys have a really quick idea think about how you can do an experiment okay so keep thinking along those lines because you re going to design your experiment for it okay i have balloons i see the word dissolves i saw the word fizzy and escape okay alright i m going to write down some of these words that i m seeing i saw dissolved i know i saw escaped fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped but thank you for reminding me did you have fizzy separately yeah oh okay on your observation sight or what could happen yeah what could happen what could happen okay blended okay i had gas you had chemical reaction bubbles did i pretty much get the kinds of things you think may have happened any any totally different ideas that you think happened you think it was still it became carbon dioxide okay alright alright focus up here then good i see the same mixture when i did the first demonstration first thing you said was magic then someone said chemical reaction dissolved disappeared changed neutralized i see the same combination of words dissolved escaped fizzy blended vanished chemical reaction magic i just see a little different priority okay now i m a scientist i can t really test magic can t really test if something was magic what i can test are the science type words i can test chemical reaction i can test blended i can sort of test fizzy escaped dissolved these i can test i can try to figure out a way to determine whether the tablet dissolved or escaped or a combination of both i can figure out if it being fizzy had something to do with it i can figure out if it was blended in i can figure out if it was a chemical reaction or i can let you do this and that s what i m going to do on your other half sheet you should have another half sheet on your table first thing i need you to do is in your group i need you to come to a consensus that means you guys have got to agree the first question on there says okay where s the disappearing matter but i asked you to think about it in terms of everything you ve seen today i magically changed clear liquid into pink liquid and then pink liquid back into clear liquid again you saw a candle magically get shorter and the wick magically disappearing and some black stuff come out of nowhere and you saw an alka seltzer tablet vanish okay so your group needs to agree on an overall theory where s the disappearing matter i want you to discuss it and i want you all to write the exact same sentence for where s the disappearing matter at the top of your paper okay so you have to agree there was a small piece that i put in right now and the alka seltzer went up so you know that it goes to the bottom not to the top okay that s a great observation because its very specific i like it so you all need to talk about okay so in every single experiment it turned into a gas so the pink liquid turned into a gas and the white liquid turned into a gas and when the clear liquid went pink liquid the wax turned into a gas i didn t even see it disappear oh when you blew it out you saw smoke so when you blew it out the amount of smoke that went off do you think it was equal to the amount of candle that s missing oh the liquid was a solid this is a gas so tell me about the liquid again because i only saw liquid so i keep if the pink was less dense than the white if the density explained it have you ever seen liquids that have different densities combined have you ever seen oil in water okay so what does it look like when you have two different density liquids did you see layers with the where d the pink stuff go disappeared by itself okay so these are the things you guys have to talk about you can t just take one person s you guys gotta make sure you all agree and it has to be an explanation that explains all three events that we saw today so when i say where s the disappearing matter you tell me it turned into a gas i m going to say okay then the pink liquid turned into a gas i didn t see bubbles okay so it has to be a sentence that explains it all you guys aren t talking here okay the disappearing matter is in the liquid so you still think the alka seltzer tablet is in there okay so you think it s in there but it s now bubbles okay it s in there but it s now bubbles so it changed in to bubbles and then what about the pink liquid and the clear liquid you think it s all still in there okay but that time no bubbles but it s still in there okay so candle where did the rest of the wick go is it still there okay so you were good for two out of three but you can t say it s still in there for the candle so change your sentence talk about it change your sentence just a little bit i get that you re saying that right but change your sentence a little bit so it applies to all three events okay what s your sentence that everyone has agreed on that matter turns into so you had bubbles in your candle no oh this is supposed to be to explain all three events we saw today okay this is a good start but it has to be more general where is the disappearing matter in general today dissolved is good for this one is this one dissolved nope okay so can you think of something dissolved and melted have in common so you can make it one sentence to explain everything okay doesn t show up anymore does that mean it s gone okay that s where you have to agree you have to agree whether it is gone or not okay okay stop for just one second i talked to a couple of really good groups but a couple of groups are very stuck because they disagree i told you you all had to agree and you had to explain all three things it s like the most difficult thing you can possibly do he won t listen to you i hear you okay i m listening here s the thing in the disagreements i ve seen the disagreement is is it gone or is it not gone does that make sense okay did it go away did it disappear or is it still in there that s the disagreement now i have an idea what if we let s pick one experiment okay i think for this class the easiest experiment to deal with would be the tablet the alka seltzer and the vinegar okay write that down on that half sheet as the experiment we chose the experiment we chose the alka seltzer we re going to choose that as a class what are the materials we put in the tablet and the vinegar write those down on that left side it says materials we put in do we put in anything else i didn t trick you i swear okay so we had vinegar and we had a tablet what did you see come out bubbles we ve got bubbles so write those on the right hand side we ve got bubbles fizz he thinks he s saying he thinks the fizz is carbon dioxide that s fine we can call it whatever you want and what some kind of guess and what else are you left with anything else you re still left with some liquid right okay so write that down you re left with you ve got bubbles and you re left with bubbly liquid here s what i think we need to prove we need to prove if what we put in is the same as what we got out how we can tell if something s there if we can t see it in science okay you ve got bubbles what do you think nick we weigh the vinegar and the alka seltzer tablet we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards and see of the number s the same,0.0
the fact that he couldn t do it because he didn t have enough money to do it what would you do in that situation would you try to get money isn t this kind of different because we re all girls yeah but if it was a boy and he was the one who didn t have money do you feel like the chapters that we read do you feel like you could tell what pip was going to be doing kind of you could tell that he was becoming more stuck up wants to change himself and not be around the poor people are you doing the discussion director did you do any questions in regards to his did you have any direct questions with regards to the text yeah one of them was like how did pip change from the beginning of the book to where he s at now like his character and basically how he acted what was the question i missed brianna where you said about the girls i didn t hear the question i just heard your response his was in chapter 29 when he is becoming part of her marriage he was just like how would you feel or whatever none of us really had an answer because the situation is different like it s different for the guys she s the one who s like the rich girl who s the recording one so on page 128 paragraph two that s where herbert tells miss havisham s story that s important because it kind of explains why she is the way that she is he explains that you meet miss pocket and then she s kind of like he kind of explains why she s kind of crazy all right chapter 8 was interesting because he was home from war and in the camp he started to treat people he treated them like they were all heroes and he shared the cigarettes with him one time he shared the cigarettes with them and was even when he was amongst the russians he didn t care they were struggling to survive he felt sorry for them which as a connector i ve connected it to i don t know if you guys have seen tears of the sun i have and avatar in tears of the sun he wanted to go and try to rescue people but he got stuck behind enemy lines like they re struggling people too trying to gain their freedom and then same thing in avatar paul kind of reminded me of how he was behind and he was with the russians but he thought that they weren t as bad as he the military was the only bad part about them civilians he felt sorry for them that they had to go through all this they were being killed their people were being killed and they were actually just regular people trying to make it everybody was dying because they used all this stuff in the military and they weren t caring about the civilians the prisoners they were they had to trade whatever they had to get like a couple supplies to the refugees he started to wonder like why are people higher up people he d never met forcing them yeah so then this whole section made me think about that so i thought that could be like the controversial part to talk about this whole section which whole section the one you were just talking about they re talking about magic yeah they re talking about the magic and being invisible and then he and scares them away it really showed a struggle between antonio internally with religions yeah in one he had keys and then in the other one it was totally crazy yeah that s my next section is that dream i think it s page 119 that whole dream is really important because it s like it kind of highlights what i just said about how he might be the next person or whatever he goes to this dream and it s kind of the same thing he s been facing through the whole book his mom s side versus his dad s side and ultima kind of comes out and is like well you are both you have to find a happy medium it s all within the world of his dreams and then page 139 one part that i thought was really really important was his brother at the brothel these two chapters i think they re kind of jam packed i just kind of picked stuff that would be good to talk about and then page 139 paragraph three they re talking about how the group can be buried in the casket of time i just felt that was informative and something that we should look at just pretty much the whole funeral the funeral was good styling like i don t know these four chapters there was no part where you didn t it s like read these four chapters exactly after i read the chapter i wrote some questions down the first one is what did the contrast between the golden carp and the black bass how the golden carp made the black bass jump and his missing of the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for abel the golden carp story was just very interesting the whole controversy is that he s catholic but part of him really wants to believe in this whole it s not like he wasn t interested in it but he still didn t believe but then he still respected the story itself and the respect of the carp it made me feel like the golden carp would bring it up could antonio it made me feel that antonio s struggle between his mother s beliefs and his father s how his father was like on the corpse strewn shore i remember there was something like when you re in the ocean it s the same water it s like ultima came in she was like you don t pick one you re both that s it you can t just choose one path you should be a priest cowboy i think the way it was portrayed was like because of the way he was brought up it was kind of showing the negative she s brought up she s not there but she s brought up too much i feel like she s a goal though to be like be some kind of spirit type thing he hopes that she s like someone who s not fake so i guess he s trying to like make things work with everyone else and see like what his relationship with other people and to finally be able to call a i feel like he compares all of his relationships to her he has that standard didn t he point out like all the flaws of her that was just creepy i was just like poor guy to have all of these weird awkward dreams i m going to say foreshadowing i m sticking by that and saying ultima s going to die and he s going to be the new i m sticking by that and that s foreshadowing look at you go all of those things are foreshadowing or are they just predicting something that happened in the past most of them well i think the one where remember where he went into a brothel in the one dream right exactly so i think that most of the dreams are foreshadowing they re not showing directly what happens but hints basically i m a beast we don t even have to read the rest of the book because i just gave it to you because we know what s happening i said also in chapter 14 the bad dream what do you make of it is he seeing the sinners as deserters that all witches are being spun out and that he needs to step forward or does the golden carp have like stronger power what do you think it symbolizes i think there are good witches and there are bad witches the bad witches are the ones that should be like that s antonio s issue as well i think he s kind of figured out that there s something different about ultima i think he s kind of figured out that he s kind of just like oh they re evil and she s good if she s a witch then she s evil so it s kind of this contrast of can a witch be good it s kind of like the question of what he wants to believe versus it kind of relates to the civil war and the africans and their personal stuff it kind of relates to that the white people they didn t want to believe that they re intelligent and they re friends he doesn t want to believe that a witch can be good because he s been told otherwise and he s a catholic and witches are evil i think that the golden carp symbolizes perhaps the rebirth i think the two most important themes symbol figures are the owl and the carp,0.0
tell them what you wrote describe your three pictures and then they re going to share what they saw and the three pictures they picked the cat i picked the roller coaster man what did you get for what i only did two i think the earth y all did the roller coaster max is that possible why not what did you write there s no gravity so in that picture he s weightless but where is he in front of a building so he s on a planet right yeah so what should happen if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video he s falling he should fall right all right write that down next to that picture i don t mean to do that all right so let s look at the roller coaster he couldn t even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down so that s why why he wouldn t fall like that and that s either like strange stuff but i don t think he could fall like that unless he he can t fall like that that s impossible get his weight and yeah exactly cause he can t do that yeah cause you can see his shadow under that and don t think he i think he got like a hoop or something so like a little string or something or like he fall yeah cause he can t do that they must have took that while he was cause that s impossible earth s gravity pulling him like that unless he in space or something all right so why would he fall because the force of gravity pushing down so why would he fall that way and not fall that way the gravity would push him down and not up so there s like there s gravity on earth so like if you consider like how newton found the apple when it fell to the ground okay so you know there s something going on that s pulling you down and you say what if you were on the other side of the earth would it be pulling you up then if you were on the other side or would it still pull you down to the ground it would still pull you down to the ground all right so on the planet what can we say about gravity where is it trying to pull you to the center ah to the center so it doesn t matter where you stand it s not pulling you down it s just trying to pull you where to the center to the center okay all right one more minute for sharing make sure you have three pictures described on your t chart if you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor do that now and you got the solar system okay so it says planets can move because of gravity where are they moving around the sun and what has them go in a circle and not flying away all right who would like to share what they wrote with their group their favorite one their favorite picture all right arquel which one was your favorite picture the roller coaster roller coaster who picked roller coaster all right so let s all look at the roller coaster and arquel tell us what your team wrote down and sarah will add it to our list we had put that the gravity brings the speed to the to the roller coaster so if you wanted to make the speed increase you would want to bring your hill higher so therefore the the speed will increase and it ll go faster all right so arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster so if you want a faster roller coaster you need to build a higher roller coaster did anybody write anything different for roller coaster carlos what did you write oh the same thing but the steepness of the hill when it s going down it increases its velocity and it s more g s all right so he says the steeper the hill more velocity more g s what s a g let s have carlos try first then we can help him out if he needs help what s a g you said g yeah a g is a pull okay so it s a pull adriana you want to add to it it s a force pushing against you all right pushing against you anybody else want to add to that it s a pull its a force it s pushing against you how do we get a g force what do you think austin you have a push or pull you have excess friction air accelerates push or pull excess friction arquel all the forces together all the forces put together on you okay so let s write g force down and put a question cause we re still not sure what that is maybe we can get there so we re not sure quite what a g is but we know it has something to do with gravity all right let s pick another picture who had a favorite picture that we haven t talked about that wasn t a roller coaster what was your favorite picture greg the dude the dude who is the dude he has a name we know who that is who is that enrique johnson it was newton right what was newton s first name not john isaac issac there we go issac newton all right and what does the dude say isaac newton what s he saying what s his quote not that dude this one oh the floating dude okay the floating dude he d rather talk about the floating dude above isaac newton okay so let s look at the guy floating in the middle of the air he looks like he s planking is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture no greg why do you say this is impossible because the earth s gravitational pull right okay so he says the earth s gravitational pull what like this wouldn t work because when you pull okay he should be being pulled down to the center of the earth why do you say the center cause that s where the gravitational pull s coming from cause that s where all the gravity wants to take you and that s where all the gravity s coming from i like that answer anybody want to add to it vanessa but if you have pressure against both forces you could possibly stay up longer okay so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer chloe force where would that force come from your body so how could he if he s not touching the ground make himself float what s underneath you that you don t see gravity well we don t see gravity but what s underneath him it s around us right now air the air right so let s think about the air if we could make the air thicker what would we also increase the gravity not the gravity we re trying to go against the force of gravity the weight the force against our weight what s that called let s think about a boat floating in the water bouyance bouyant force right so if you could increase the bouyant force of the air and vanessa said if you could make that strong enough you should be able to float does anyone know a planet where there s more thick clouds than we have here it s our neighbor mars he has clouds who has clouds who has thick clouds jarissa venus venus yeah is that what you were going to say venus has super thick clouds right and if we could go there maybe there d be enough air underneath you that you could float in the air if they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body okay all right anymore for the floating guy did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air i know that karima and anthony had a good answer what did you guys write down anthony put that i put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the earth and it will like like it would it pulls you to the center of the earth and what did we decide about where you stand on earth like on the other side so what would happen if you went to the other side of the earth would it still pull you the same way or is it going to pull you an opposite way the same way the same way where is it always going to pull you down towards the center to the center to the middle okay it doesn t matter what planet you stand on doesn t matter where you are it s trying to take you to the center of the object okay so why do we get stuck to the earth and that the earth s stuck to us in this picture cause the earth s solid and it doesn t let us go out into the okay so he said the earth is solid are we solid yes hmm okay so maybe it s not that we re solid cause maybe there s something else going on what do you think carlos the earth has more mass than us the earth has more mass than us jenny what s mass mass is well all of us then we all have it how would you give a definition of mass what is it about us the type of weight it s the type of weight okay we re on the right track who wants to help her out what s mass the amount of density amount of density okay we re getting better jarissa the amount of space that it takes well what would that be what s your space volume okay so space is volume we re still trying to figure out what s mass we ve heard some density words we ve heard volume words what do you think ky the amount of electrons oh we re getting closer so it s your electrons your atoms ah your atoms so it s how many atoms you have inside your body that s your mass so now someone else said weight so let s go back to that how do you get weight so you stand on the scale how do you know your weight what is going on what do you think hakeem pounds we measure it in pounds okay so how do me measure it how do you get pounds what s happening to your mass what happens when you stand on the scale what is it measuring your weight your weight so then how do we figure that out what s going on what s going on on a scale carlos the gravity is pushing you down gravity is pushing you down so what happens to your weight if you have more mass you re heavier you re heavier so your weight how would we give a description of weight now we know mass is how many atoms you have we know volume is how much space you take up so now what s weight carlos has kind of said it for us how would we put it as a definition it s the pull of what on your mass gravity pull of gravity so let s look at the guy in the picture again if this was going to be true what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float would he be allowed to have a mass on earth hakeem says no vanessa says yes if you re going to float and there s gravity always trying to pull you down in order to float what do we have to do with our mass decrease our mass okay so let s think about if we go to another planet with our weight does your mass change if you go to another planet yes no do all of a sudden you have more atoms in you no depending on the gravity what did you say you have the same atoms but your weight and mass changes you said the same amount of atoms so your weight and mass changes but if you have the same amount of atoms isn t your mass the same yeah okay so what s the only thing that would change jarissa the gravity the gravity so then what would that change about your weight would it change or would it stay the same it would change it will change so what can we say if we went to a smaller planet you ll become lighter you ll become lighter why because it has less gravity has less gravity so less pull you weight less okay so let s put weightless next to g force as another word we should look up ready all right so what i want you to do now using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about i want you to flip your paper over and in the circle i would like you to try with your partner to write a definition for what you think gravity is i ll give you one minute you and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is and write that in your circle back make sure you guys share that okay a lot of weight or what s the other word of how many atoms you have what s it pulling on very good so it pulls on your mass and think about where it s trying to pull oh that s a good definition of gravity try to write your definition on your paper make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper pulls what pulls the weight you almost said it mass mass make sure you guys share that okay you guys done okay so what is gravity it s a force so that means it s a what a a short pull gravity s pulling us right okay so what s so what do you think is it pushing or pulling pushing pulling ooh we have a disagreement better figure out which ones right okay so it s a pull so where is it trying to take you to and what is it trying to take about your your definition all right what are you having i wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center okay so the word i want you to make sure we say is invisible cause we ll talk about that okay all right so let s share our definitions who would like to share their definition first all right ky we put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle all right gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle so sarah can you add that to the circle arquel what did you guys write gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the earth and it wants to the mass okay so you added mass to that okay so it s pulling on mass what do you want to add angel i want to add to kyle s answer that it s invisible invisible so let s think about what we learned about forces if it s invisible you can t see it is it touching you yes or is it everywhere it s everywhere everywhere so is it a contact force or a non contact force non contact why do you say that israel because it s not touching you it s not touching you so even if you re floating in outer space will gravity still be there yes what do you think carlos yes you say yes so those astronauts will they still feel some gravity even though they re out at the space station what do you think angel outer space has some gravity but greater than that s why they wouldn t feel it what do you think it depends on we have mass so far but the strength of gravity also depends on something else we have mass but what could it also depend on vanessa force okay gravity is a force angel was getting there he was saying that it s still pulling on you it s just not as strong the weight that s mass we talked about mass and weight trying to get the other thing that s going to control gravity how big the planet is okay so that s mass let s think about the astronauts who are not as close to the earth are they weightless they have the same amount of mass their mass didn t change but they went farther away from the earth so why are they weightless why do they float what s the other factor going on with gravity moving away from the center of the earth so what do we call that has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on we have mass and we re looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity what do you guys think if i m really far away from jarissa am i able to grab her as much as if i was closer no if i go real close to her is it easier for me to pull on her yes but what happens if i go far away i have the same mass my mass doesn t change can i reach her as easily now no so what s the other thing going on with gravity distance distance so if you re far away from the earth can gravity pull on you as hard no no but the closer you get the little bit stronger little bit stronger so then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on earth but i don t feel the sun we re closer to the earth than we are the sun so we re going to feel the earth before we would feel the sun but now if we left the planet we started going somewhere else say i was going to mars what would happen the closer i got to mars who would start pulling me now mars the mars center of its planet would start to pull me okay so let s look at the picture of the planets thinking about pulling to the center why in the picture of the planets is the sun in the middle of all the planets because it s the biggest oh it s the biggest one we got a couple of different answers so let s share with our neighbor first see if you know why the sun is in the center you got 30 seconds it s got the biggest mass it got the biggest mass and it s the biggest so like it got the most gravitational pull that s why it s in the middle all right marco why do you think the sun is in the center of our solar system because i don t know you don t know okay javier what do you think you re his partner what did you guys talk about based on what we just talked about why would the sun go in the center it has more mass it has more mass so what does it also have more gravity so he s always going to be in the middle right what if we had a bigger star come our way like what about a black hole say one of our neighbors blew up one of our,0.0
get out your journal i ll read it aloud and i ll put the time on the timer get our your journal we re looking at journal entry number 14 and you re not allowed to write i don t know take a guess if you re not sure but don t write i don t know so question 14 is very simple why do you think an earthquake happens you can write it you can draw a picture so i m asking you why do you think an earthquake happens you have three minutes right now to write what you think why do you think an earthquake happens why do you think an earthquake happens and why do you think remember there s no right or wrong it s what you think is the answer remember you can draw a picture if that helps you okay if you want to draw alright you ve got like a minute left so you can draw a picture write down what you think i m gonna give you about 30 more seconds many of you are still writing and that s fine but i thought before we talk about this let s take a look at a little clip because i realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake so this one s kinda cool it was shot obviously on somebody s iphone so it s not the best quality but many of you know that japan has lots of earthquakes all the time they re very used to earthquakes so this person lives in japan and so again they re used to earthquakes right so they weren t like panicking so he actually took his iphone and filmed the ground so i want you to take a look we re only gonna look at about a minute of it but i want you to notice how the ground is moving okay and we re gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen so this is pretty cool so this was back in march 2011 so notice now they re gonna go to another part notice the ground in the back watch the back you ll see something happen watch what s happening alright so that s real it s not like there was a machine underneath there doing that so you guys we can solve what s happening so let s take that and let s talk about this through why do you think an earthquake happens why do you guys think an earthquake happens and remember when we talk we re gonna let one person go at a time and we re gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear alright so let s just start on this side we re gonna work this way tony what did you write why do you think an earthquake happens well i think there s something wrong with the mantle that s coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake okay something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate also i liked how you used a complete sentence so remember if you re not sure there s some sentence starters up there jheyline what did you write i think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other excellent because plate boundaries overlap each other jose i think that earthquakes happen when plates crash when plates crash together anybody else adrian and then dajana i think that earthquakes happen because plates slide because plates slide excellent dajana i think an earthquake happens from too much stress also i think the plate boundaries overlap ooh i like what you said and that s exactly where i m going next so in that video clip you guys saw the ground move i m gonna give you 10 seconds and that 10 seconds you re gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move what direction was that ground moving so you have 10 seconds share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you go 10 seconds alright finishing up in five four three two one zero okay so i heard lots of people talking so i m gonna pull a name this time remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said so what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip let s see now neferly what kind of movement did you see they were moving apart good moving apart what else did you notice angel they were moving apart moving apart what else did you notice dajana well it was crashing everywhere but i saw the ooh kind of like water coming out of the sky josh what else did you notice oh so a little bit of up and down movement alright so up and down movement anybody else notice any other type of movement so you guys said up and down you said moving apart oh did you see how that piece literally slid yeah alright so that s movement you guys know some words for this what are some words that we ve learned to describe movement and dajana said a couple what words jina shearing yes so there was some shearing happening what else was happening rodolfo tension yes some tension pulling apart and what else did you notice daniel compression yeah compression squeezing together okay so we re getting this idea that didn t dajana you said it was stress or you said stress dajana right so something about stress being kind of important so we re gonna take that idea give us a moment okay thanks alright so sorry about the interruption so stress dajana was saying stress so let me give you an example so let s imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band let s imagine that it s a rock and let s imagine it s a rock i know it s a rubber band but let s imagine it s a rock so i m gonna take i m gonna go like this it s a rock remember so i m doing this to the rock and then i m gonna stand here for an entire year and then a year from now i m gonna put my hands further apart and then another year i m gonna put my hands further apart what s happening to this rock or this rubber band what s happening to this rock over time what s happening lupita to this rock it s stretching it s stretching what else add to that tucker and stretching it out stretch is added to it stress is added too nice victor so maybe it s getting a little compression okay maybe a little compression too my hands are getting tired tony continental drift ooh like okay so if there were other pieces like my hands were africa and south america they d be moving apart ernesto thinner in the middle thinner in the middle sakura tension so tension now i m gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt but what would happen if i kept doing that i m gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you what might happen if i kept doing that and i kept doing that and i kept doing that what might happen to this rubber band or this rock so 10 seconds to the person next to you ten seconds alright finishing up in five four three two one zero okay i heard lots of good discussion so if i kept doing this i kept doing it i kept doing it moses what might happen it might crack and break it might crack and break everyone what else maybe might happen victor it will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it ll break ooh oh i like cause you remember this a lot right little earthquake excellent tucker it s just like when you shove your fingers go all the way back it will break oh yeah that would be painful jheyline it d probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything did everybody hear that word she just said which word did you say it would explode explode wow that s a big powerful word but that s pretty equal to what happened right big amount of power or like when you were doing that with the rock like when you were moving it like it would get more thinner and get more it would kinda get wider when after all while it s still going it s gonna like good so let s step back a little bit so who was it someone had said earthquake right you had said earthquake so it s sounding like what if that happens first so before the earth actually moves before what we saw in the video what did you guys think was happening and moses had used the word for it too what was happening to the rocks over time so over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake what s happening over time ernesto what s happening over time it s stretching it s stretching keep going with that diego it was standing it was standing tony it s spreading apart spreading apart jheyline widening widening tiger breaking breaking so wait before the breaking though you guys were saying it was stretching it was pulling so what word can you describe it building up in here building up stephanie through stress ah okay so it sounds like if we re gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first we have said stress that builds right stress builds and then what s gonna happen when the stress builds and it builds and it builds and it builds and it can t take it anymore what s going to happen manuel collide this is stress keep going not collide what s another word that s kind of same idea so you said it when i was over here it s gonna keep stressing and stressing and what s gonna happen to the rock rip it ll what rip rip what s another word you can say it ll explode explode adrian break break great so there s going to be a rupture or a break and then is that it end of the story nice day that s it where does all this energy go right there s all this energy building up where does it go yeah it ruptures it breaks and then is it over no no what where what happened where did the energy go where did that energy go irma where d it go plate tectonics yeah it has to do with plate tectonics absolutely where did that energy go where did it go rodolfo plate boundaries yeah plate boundaries so okay we got stress builds ruptures it breaks and then is that it no that s the earthquake what action yeah anna it becomes an earthquake yeah it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience jheyline shaking shaking oh so it sounds like there s a rupture or a break and then that s gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released an earthquake it s an earthquake yes and what is that shaking actually being released so the shaking is released what victor all the stress yes it s releasing all the stress what s another word you could say releasing all of its power power is a good word or diego energy energy right so it seems like all an earthquake is is stress building up building up building up breaks and then we feel that what do we experience the energy as so what do we experience think of the energy as what do we experience it as an energy that that what s that shaking shaking right alright awesome so now we re gonna you guys did that perfectly so we re gonna write that down in our notes woah i know that earthquakes release energy right so that s what happens as a result so we are not in any way done with this because we are gonna talk all about different you guys have made a good start on what s happening so we are gonna take two notes today they re pretty short i m sorry the first one s a little long the other one s super short but this is what you guys were just telling me except now we re gonna add the word elastic strain which is what you guys were telling me you were telling me that energy was building up you were telling me stress was building up and that s gonna cause elastic strain yes dajana the pictures that you showed us what it only cut through the kind of yeah yes so like maybe cause on the bottom that came out of the ground yeah and then it just spilled it over then it came out of the ground yeah so thank you for those of you who got started rodolfo let me just read this off for people so our first topic today is earthquake energy and this is what we just talked about but now we re getting a chance to write it down and we re adding in a bigger word and that word is elastic strain so elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape so elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape okay so that s step one in an earthquake step two energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks so elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves and we will learn all about those next week but you can still write down you just think released energy travels and it s felt as shaking,0.0
what are his tools is that your hose awesome now what needs to come out of the hose to put out the fire water yeah what color is it miley is helping you out look there good water what do you do with that thing marissa what s the doctor going to do with that i can t hear you what you re right listen to your heart very good do you remember what we call that not a telescope a stethoscope there you go all right miley what does your teacher need what tools a smart board a smart board are you going to draw the smart board all right are you finished with your fireman did you hear miley do you need to draw anything else for your fireman or is he all good i don t know where the fire is you re the artist where s his fire it s your fire marissa what is that bag for the doctor bag the doctor bag i love it what did you draw what is that very good and what do you do with the stethoscope check your heart a whole bunch of fire well i m glad you re the fireman and you re going to put it out i love it there you go good job that is one colorful nurse i see it it s great you re almost finished what is that orange thing it goes your mouth and what does it do do you remember it takes your temperature it s a thermometer good job what are you going to teach your kids right there good job what about the kids she s on the smart board right now very good all right just a few more minutes we have to finish up so you all can stickers a b c d e f g h i you did draw the shot you re done all right you may go give me five great job i love your fireman a b c d e f g h j j i love how nice you folded that anthony good job good job are you all finished i love it i love it good job i love your teacher she s very happy what are you going to do in art make me a picture can t wait what is this a stair bridge wow who s going to use it i love it who has an airplane what s the person i m a teacher i teach kids who flies the airplane ask aaron see if he can help you out do you remember aaron can you help him out who flies the plane what s his name the pilot yeah the pilot good job mary what are you you re not the firefighter what are you who s uniform do you have on the cop the cop s very good you re going to arrest people why they re speeding watch out aaron mary s going to catch some speeders he s arrested he s arrested what was he doing speeding speeding oh no look what happens when you speed you crash and who s going to come rescue you who will come help you if you crash the policeman and who s going to help you get better who did you see yesterday who came to visit us yesterday do you remember we went out and got to sit inside of it ambulance good job what s going on over here you re what tacos how many two thank you are they for me this is my cake your cake okay what are you going to do with your cake after you mix it up a chocolate cake oh no it just came out of the oven it just came out of the oven it looks great is there a special occasion for your cake all right that would be great i ll make sure nobody touches your cake it s fine it ll stay right there what are you going to make cookie dough what kind you don t know put your hands up she said you put it in the oven how long do you cook it five minutes or five hours five minutes good job oh no it fell i think you re doing a good job but i think you have it crooked hang on that s an awesome cookie thank you great job what do you tell her what do you say thank you thank you you re working hard you almost have it cross it good job great job helping awesome i don t know where the lid is for this did you ask dylan if he s the one that had it out dylan do you know where the lid is for the well then you need to help her show her where it s at she wasn t sure thank you oh hang on a second n o is that an r no no let s fix it r s help him out dylan what s after s all right there you go what s next there s your p q r s v then what what s going on over here you re giving him a shot why are you giving him a shot what happened to him what happened to him that he needs a shot he s sick did it hurt what was in that shot what was in the shot the needle the needle but what came out of it it was just in his hand so what did you give him yeah medicine what are you listening to your heart my heart am i okay now i m about to give you a haircut a haircut all right julius don t run all right so how do you like your job nurse good i see why you made your picture all different colors your nurse uniform is all different colors good job i think your next appointment is here have a seat she can check you out leave the chair right there that s a shot too there s a different shot yes i m scared ow shots hurt ow i think you only need one what did you just give me medicine medicine is that my band aid,0.0
and i m going to look at what number that is and i see that that is now your information that you get we re going to be writing in our chart here so do you see at the bottom of your page it has ramp with one book you re going to write the distance that your car moved now don t write 20 inches cause yours is going to be different okay you write how far your car went for ramp number one okay hold on just a second isabelle now i gave you guys numbers and the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment the number one person is going to set up the ramp so they re going to put the dictionary and the ramp get it all set up for the group the number two person is going to get to hold the car and let it go okay and then the number three person is going to measure the distance that it went okay close attention okay so you re going to all have a job to do now this is with the one dictionary when we do the experiment next we re going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes okay but for right now we re going to try just one dictionary are there any questions before we get started miguel like the first one goes first and then on the second thing like you try to set the number one does the second job and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job yes so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment okay so we don t need to fight over who gets to do the car and who can get that okay isabelle question but what if we do the same each of us what we do oh if that s what you get if you get 20 inches on yours then you write that down okay yes angie when you took no we re all going to talk to each other in nice friendly voices that s right okay max last question and then we need to get started are we going to use the rulers yes you re going to use the rulers and i know i didn t give those to the groups but i m going to pass those out right now okay can i have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group who s going to set up the ramp me okay you re number two start it in the corner it s a meter come on over here okay get your paper no but watch out don t do it awesome okay boys and girls once you get to your group you can go ahead and get started it looks farther and this group you may use this ruler okay measure it one right here and then here are you okay no from here from there there no ms sprano said from here nine inches no 11 11 11 inches it looks like eight wait is oh no it s eight remember what ms sprano said no she said from the front actually i said from the back good listening miguel so how far did the car go eight inches eight inches okay excellent so write down your information you ve got a pencil right here okay so the next step isabelle miguel and angie is you re going to try it with two dictionaries okay but number three is going to set it up look up at the chart to see who s going to set it up so who s setting it up um number two okay let s figure it out okay now go to your group for a second okay now is this how far going to yea till we go well wait a second are we measuring from the top of the ramp or are we measuring from the bottom so you re going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp and then measure to the end of the car so how far did that car go five no it s to the end of the car so how far did the car go two two inches now do you guys think that because you re on a thicker carpet that s going to change your results it should go up like that do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far yes yeah would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet yeah okay you can move to that carpet and see what the difference is and you guys will have to share that with the class okay so try it again with just one dictionary okay so then one have to let the car go guys we re going to try it with two dictionaries okay so look at the chart to see who s going to set it up next oh my god this is going to be loud we re good ms sprano she said from the very back you set it up no i mean you let go who s turn is it you re doing the first one who s number three we all have jobs to do who s number one okay so your job is to set up the ramp which you did a good job on number two person who s the number two person so giselle i m number three no she was two it s fine she s number three so giselle you re going to let the car go and look esmeralda is going to measure okay so excellent okay now put that down now which side do we need to start with very good and then we can spin it around there so now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet can you scoot it over some very good so how far did the car go seven inches good okay so let s write that down on our chart finish yours change this so it s seven inches okay now what s our next step what are we going to do next i don t know are we going to try it with two dictionaries okay so now who s going to set that up looks like the number two person so giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary so put one more dictionary on top okay good well number three is going to let the car go so now it s esmeralda s turn so you guys what do you think is going to happen do you think it s going to go farther or do you think it s going to be closer when you let go of the car right now what do you think is going to happen you think it ll fall down okay well let s see what happens woah did you see how far that went okay don t pick it now wait a second it s edgar s turn to measure so let s see how far did it go edgar so we measure to the 14 wow that went farther didn t it so your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries please go sit down in your group and raise your hand let s go sit down at our group the car s there 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half who knows how to write 15 and a half so number two would get to measure the distance on this one okay okay so let me see how you re doing here okay well can we try it again can we try it again so you re on the second experiment so number three who s the number three person he is jose s the number three person okay so jose get s to let it go should we move this out of the way or should we keep it here so are you number three no i m number one but number one set it up but then see oh okay so it looks like it s jose s turn to let the car go so hand the car no he sets up ramp can you go sit down please and i ll be right with you got it okay jose try it it s my car put it right here and let s see what happens okay let go excellent okay who s measuring me okay so let s measure now do we want it are we measuring with inches or centimeters no it s right we re doing it the right way don t worry did it go farther or was it closer okay so then i have a question for you guys listen if we put three dictionaries here do you think it s going to go farther or it s going to go closer farther you think it s going to be farther what do you think jose farther what do you think farther well okay we better check it out did you write down your numbers so for the second one it was 15 inches okay now we re on the last part that means the number three person sets up the ramp are you the number three person so set up the ramp where s your other dictionary okay so then we have to use the dictionary okay can you let go okay it s oh wow that might be pretty cool huh okay so devon it s your turn to let the car go and i like how you re moving all the stuff out of the way selena you want to stay there or do you want to move oh okay so who s turn is it to measure again no number one gets to you know what i think we mixed it up now selena lets go of the car and devon measures this time okay did you okay so maybe it s jose s turn okay go ahead ooh look how much it turned okay so measure how far it went okay so measure how far it went let s see what happened do we move the 17 try it again let s try it again okay let s see how are you guys doing you got all yours finished okay good okay well i haven t gone over that okay boys and girls raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments all three okay,0.0
isn t it nuclear fission when like fusion no fusion is when they combine nuclear fission is like when they split apart right yes so it s a fission process see ah so that s a i see that that efficient efficient it increases the safety though right it s impossible to explain no i m just saying does it no i don t understand am i the only one here apparently to you though so why is it that when the atom is unstable it s radioactive it could be it s removing protons and neutrons i think you guys can discuss this isn t it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom or something and then it gains the neutron and that s when it starts becoming like more vulnerable more vulnerable and it starts like a chain reaction you guys agree i agree i agree i agree with everybody that s right so how can radiation help them like amy said it could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources like you said what else though like cancer cancer cancer i mean i had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away it kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication any last thoughts okay that s fine thank you i have only one major i guess comment about that one i noticed steve used a lot of vocabulary words he did remember a lot of the words and i think he planned for that and then i liked the way that david actually redirected the group he asked the group how can radiation help us right at the end and then people responded to that so he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group so and then people were able to respond so that was a nice way to create a discussion okay question number two three three i m sorry okay i mean how about number four next okay i m going to do number four next no do number three the one with three no i m going to do four no i want to do three okay number four is going to go next you have two minutes to prepare number four just ignore it what is that a microphone oh it works so they can hear me right now oh it s recording well why do you think president obama might support building nuclear power plants in the usa and what are some arguments for nuclear energy david put that away okay jane who s going to go next me jane okay so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on nuclear power plant nuclear power plant well pick several the nuclear yeah the nuclear power plant can help us create more energy i mean well it s nuclear radiation for my argument you know what dano was saying no he was just going to put power plants do you know what it is yeah it s where they yeah okay what does it do creates energy okay okay what other evidence are you going to use though the fact that we are running out of well we re not running out of but in the future we might not be able to find enough energy so we need to start we need to start thinking about the future like jobs and stuff no future things that are like the future and what s going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply like what if we were running out and start thinking about that okay so the next person okay so the people on the outside if you were recording the vocabulary last time i want the people on the outside to switch so that you re recording something different so if you did evidence first switch to vocabulary if you did vocabulary switch to evidence oh sindi sit like right here okay this question is why do you think president obama might support building nuclear power plants in the u s and based on the video we watched what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy i think president obama might support building nuclear power plants in the u s because it doesn t release chemicals therefore it s eco friendly making the u s more green environmentally green i agree with her because another reason i think the president might support it is because like like right now we re in an economic crisis what you call the thing and then like making new plants may create more jobs for people it ll create jobs for building them and then it ll also benefit everybody for clean power i agree i agree because it builds economic stabilization and it ll create jobs for the future like for more years because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need you know like to build it and once it s built you still need to work with it so i think the job s going to last for a while i agree but if we re in an economic crisis like if we re in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it like where s the money going to come from well we re already in debt so we ll get even more debt yeah it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor we d get funding yeah and we have to like think about the future and how it s going to benefit you know for the economy and making more power plants would just provide like a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff and more you know we ll get more electricity you know if we build more nuclear power plants yeah and not just 20 but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that needs luxuries rising electricity demands it won t leave the u s behind and all the new tech stuff and the more factories and the more power plants we produce we make the more electricity and the more factories it will get more stuff it will build the more jobs and that will raise up the economic problems yeah because more stuff will be done that way so now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy what do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of the thing that causes cancer probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off well they don t give it off the water the coolant or whatever and then like they don t have nowhere to store it i think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build but they didn t build they re going to run out of space to put the waste in also it s going to cause cancer to everyone but doesn t it cure cancer and stuff it has benefits but more like some freak accident can happen like what happened in fukushima or the third mile at the three mile yeah so say you never know what can happen that s the downside because if it does happen then it s like downhill from there because people start getting sick then their kids start dying and i don t know yeah and like giovanni said if we are in an economic crisis like where are we going to get the rest of the money we re just going to get it from debt and stuff like that we re going to help raise it up but we ll also fall more in debt yeah going back to the nuclear waste can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem because it s just there kevin i think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution that s what i think cause more what it causes more war and pollution war well i mean this isn t on camera right okay someone else wait what was the question again elaborate on what is nuclear waste nuclear waste why is that such a problem for us well it s a problem because there s nowhere where you could actually safely put it other than like i think they have this i read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes that s the only place that you can like get rid of it don t throw it in the ocean because it ll contaminate everything you can t just like leave it in the ground because then it ll probably like leak and also doesn t it if it rains if water gets in it it s dangerous so that s why they have to find a place where it s not like why is it dangerous if water gets into it soil i guess the waste and the water mix and then like it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it ll mess up the ocean or like water and we end up drinking it and scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste like they re thinking of shooting it out into space or anything one thing nobody talked about was half life what does the half life have to do with nuclear waste i think a bunch of years what does it have to do with obama say it louder what say it louder we re talking about that noise wait what was your question what does half life have to do with nuclear waste half life nuclear waste so energy so why is nuclear waste bad exactly oh because they haven t determined the amount of years of when the half life is i think they determined like so they so it was an estimate it wasn t actually a fact they just estimated that so it could be before so they wouldn t be able to prevent to prevent it from affecting society oh good so let s just get this done let s try the next group okay thank you i know bryan i don t need to look it up i know this already okay do you guys want to break before you go up okay you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself so it s not a shock okay question number three let s come up people seem anxious let s do this okay no phone diana we re missing people yeah we are okay so people on the outside you guys should switch so if you did evidence you know so what you did one time evidence looking for evidence and one time you re looking for vocabulary okay so people on the outside make sure you re checking different parts okay so what i might change the question you guys what it happens okay number three what recommendations would you make to president obama regarding clean energy and climate change so for example they re trying to build two nuclear power plants in georgia so what recommendations will you make to him about building in georgia building in jorj ee uh georgia the state um i think he should make sure that employees aren t making careless mistakes such as the human error in the three mile island i think that he should promote programs on alternative energy but not just nuclear energy but he could also use nuclear energy because it could because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20 of our energy already comes from nuclear energy so we could just get more energy through nuclear power i think we shouldn t use it because of it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer okay nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates nuclear power plants create toxic waste i would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it s most struggling recommendations i would make to obama regarding nuclear energy is that to stop because it s too dangerous to handle and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists they can use it to murder to murder me or destroy countries we can t prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants then the nuclear radiation which is unstable can harm by radioactivity and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit fukushima and this means that it can happen to anyone even us that s what i wrote i think it could be a good idea but i think they should focus more on how it could harm people to try and control the harmfulness so it won t harm people yeah i think it s a good idea i think my recommendation for obama is that it is not good to nuclear because it s going to affect us it s going to affect our pollution and he s going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn t do that yeah i agree with charlie too we don t know what nuclear energy could also like harm us which ways or i mean we do but i mean it s better like we could just focus on studying more like having more thoughts like ask him what s better it s like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we re using now so i have to change one question based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read what argument has influenced you the most the fukushima argument so go ahead and explain it to the group though because um things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us like human error and i think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage the area which is nobody can go because it s radioactive and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like i don t know thousands of years just for the half life and we won t be able to use that space anymore it kills everything people got cancer,0.0
does that include slaves yes does that include women yes okay so how are we supposed to take uneducated people s opinions when they obviously don t know what s gonna happen because a lot of people in russia i mean if the russian s knew how to read they would write a song if they knew what was going on and they were smart enough they would obviously write a song about it i think john locke had one more thing to say is that right yes okay and to answer your question about the government the government was created to protect people s rights it wasn t created for you to abuse power and just do what you think you need to do they are only for them and it s not doing what it needs to do then yeah the people do have the right people aren t dead so obviously i m doing what i need to do and i m protecting them if that s all you care about then that would just be easy not to let people die obviously they re not having problems where their lives threatened we have all these like if you re wherever you live anyways wherever you live if your king or queen wasn t doing what they thought to protect you guys and you had all these invaders coming in then you could argue being mad at them because they re not protecting you and doing their job that s when you know they re upset plus you re saying that your people aren t educated but they re educated enough to know what their rights are and how they should be treated so i mean you can think you should be treated in a certain way but i could say i think i should be able to slide on this floor right now but i might not know if i slide on this floor right now i m gonna die but because i m not educated in that kind of way but your king or queen is educated in that kind of way so they re not gonna let you do stuff like that we re not asking for stuff like that we re asking for our natural rights i know that they what s the word the end result conclusion i know the conclusion of you guys getting your natural rights and the way that you guys are acting for them in a way i m gonna get you guys what you guys need to get your conclusion is gonna be a whole lot better than what you guys are hoping so what s the point of having your natural rights if you re going to abuse the law it doesn t mean you re going to abuse the law it just means that you re gonna be more cooperative towards the law you re attributed to a beggar if they don t give you your natural rights it s like a two way type thing if they give it to you then you re gonna be happy about it and you re gonna want to follow them and listen to them instead of trying to revolt and kick them out if they re not gonna give it to you alright so we say government is a good thing bad thing or kind of in between let s go around the room real quick what would you guys say i would say government is a positive thing because it stopped some starving and it keeps everything in place okay good we re in between because it s there to protect your rights but if they re not gonna be there to protect you then they shouldn t be there at all okay so it has to be done in the correct way government is a good thing any explanation why because if you don t have a government then you aren t organized and if you re not organized then you re like chickens would be in your home we think that philosophers they write what they feel about us and they don t do anything about it and they don t understand where we re coming from you philosophers are lucky men you write on paper and paper is patient unfortunate empress that i am i write on the susceptible skins of living beings meaning that they write on paper because they can put out they opinion like that but we have to be responsible for all the people in our country and we re trying to do what s best for them in your opinion frederick we think government is interesting because we need a government to be organized but government also does a lot of bad stuff we think the government is completely necessary along with religion because it brings unity to the people and i think the laws and religion kind of go hand in hand because i wouldn t consider myself a christian but others probably would because of certain stuff i write in books that s why they consider me as a heretic but the bible says thou shall not kill killing someone is also against the law thou shall not steal is also against the law i feel the government is good if it uses the right power basically for their rights and things as long as it should be there we feel it should be there but it needs to be used appropriately we believe sort of that the government is a positive if you didn t have a government as a base structure for your country if you didn t the government perhaps is a positive due to the fact that the government helps you if you need it to an extent i agree with catherine the great in the fact that it sort of really helps with the territory i ve been interviewed by many people and specifically saying to many people i ve said it that i m capable of saying whatever i want so my country is there and i get to do whatever i want if you were the king you d do whatever you want to theoretically alright voltaire pretty much the government is an abomination i mean there s way more bad and nasty leaders than there are good lawful public leaders that do good stuff too many leaders take advantage of their people in their kingdoms so i think they should just all go away start over with enlightened total what about slavery what do you think about slavery what do you people think about slavery what about slavery anybody have an opinion is slavery good bad or otherwise i wouldn t say slavery is a negative then again i wouldn t say that it s a bad thing either i guess you could say mostly slavery came from austria due to the fact that if you get in trouble with another country and they sand to the austria you re pretty much going to be a slave for the rest of your life you pretty much work for them you work for the pope himself and you work for the roman emperor voltaire i think slavery is a necessary evil a necessary evil well we disagree with because we see everyone as equals and think everyone should be treated equally and it s part of their natural rights such as freedom exactly that would be considered one of their natural rights rousseau serfs which were similar to slaves very good last comment there thomas hobbes i don t think we really have an opinion on slavery but if the king decided to have slavery in the country i think we should respect that and do it for the betterment of the country respect the authority of the king no piling up because that s what slavery is there for okay very good any last minute comments i think we re almost out of time for our salon discussion i heard a lot of good ideas does anybody have any last minute comments that they want to add yes frederick a lot of things that we have to say i didn t get three things of everybody s opinion all you guys are really self you re not sinners or anything for lack of better words and i wouldn t read them meaning i would probably do anything to get support from my people and i d do anything for my people like my dad would do anything for me he raised me well and slavery and natural rights and all that mumbo jumbo shouldn t be from you because you re not them you re not just as you re not voltaire and i m not thomas so you can t overrule anybody else it s not right very good excellent job ladies and gentlemen thank you for attending our little salon here hopefully we learned some new ideas and got to hear some other opinions of people throughout europe so let s give yourselves a little round of applause alright you are now done with the salon you can take your little parts if you want and put them up because you are no longer those people you are now you in modern day times back to modern day times but i do have some questions we are not done with our discussion but you are not longer your person you are back to being you we are not done and i m going to ask you your questions now please listen what was the purpose of a salon we ve talked about this from what you ve right here what was the purpose of a salon exchange ideas exchange ideas any other purposes sometimes like joseph did over there but to find out what people thought of you okay to find out different opinions okay maybe see something from a different side or viewpoint it was a devised to discuss music who gets painting time okay so it has an artistic point to it as well it was just another way for us to learn about taking notes and stuff like research on our person and then hearing what the other people thought but as far as back then is what we re thinking about oh back then oh yes you were right about what you said just to exchange ideas and go back until people like it would you say there were effective back then yes we haven t talked about results we kind of left off talking about these people and how they talked about things and came to the salon do you think this is going to be an effective method of discussing the conversations we were having with them over there like how they didn t think that we were listening to what the people were saying and how we were just gonna stay the way we were and stuff but actually they got to hear our thinking about moving to where we need to go it s gonna take them a little longer to get there okay do we have anything like salons today do we have salons today yes what happens at salons now right so it s not so much political all the time in exchanging ideas about government stuff but they re still kind of socialization and gossip going on is there anything that we have in place or anything in our society today which you can discuss opinions especially about government or problems that you might have in life um since salons don t really go with that but so if you have a problem with your country or with the government or with something that s going on we don t have a salon to go and meet like this and talk with people but is there anything that we do that or any other thing another way to voice your problem if your dissenting and you have a different agreement or a disagreement with the government or with anybody anything what can you do don t we have press conferences what do you mean representatives write letters write letters to who the government congress the government okay they also have environment issues and worldwide problems worldwide problems okay that s kind of similar where different people come and talk about their issues their problems and maybe how to solve them you kind of have different levels like if you have a problem with like if it s about the school you go to the school board okay president or people who are trying to be president they have the debates on tv okay good as far as being an average citizen what can you do say there s an issue with the world or an issue in our country or an issue in our city that we want to see fixed what can we do you think to maybe go about fixing that or trying to get that done protest protest is that allowed are we allowed to protest yes were you allowed to protest back then it depends on where you live at depends on where you live we have a different government now right back then it was monarchy now it s more of a democracy so what we re seeing here a little bit a little bit different method and a lot more opportunity there s a town like,0.0
well i can start i just kind of wanted to follow with lina s going back to the very beginning of the book and sort of i guess a response to mariana s comment i think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish so it s not about making this huge change in one moment cause that s never going to happen it s about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step and since we are young adults you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives before you know it things are gonna change so even though it seems discouraging like oh it s really hard and upsetting and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting it s about continuing on and taking those little steps yeah you know at the same time i think there s something hard about it but it s not something that is beyond our control it s just we don t want to appear confrontational because i thought we were having this discussion on friday i was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying and was listening if there were any instances although it doesn t count as racism you count it as prejudice by definition i was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom s boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her and he said oh i wish you were white he wouldn t do that stuff if you were white this was a black girl there was this other in my physiology class isn t that not racism well that s not do you think she was serious or don t you i don t know but you know even if it s joking it s still a pretty serious thing to say and besides there was a mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends some relative saying get a bean or a shnean but you know even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where i could have said well no that s not an appropriate thing to say that could be offensive to people but you know i didn t just because i didn t want to be confrontational so obviously that s some fault of my own for not getting involved there going off of what tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever i m wondering if you re considered actively racist if those jokes don t bother you like i hear that all the time in my third block class and it doesn t bother me it s kind of funny sometimes because a lot of the time it s not interracial it s the same race you know what i m trying to say there s no armenians but i can t roast another armenian should i throw this this is not gonna work laser it bro maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it i think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of show how comfortable we all are with other races and i make fun of my parents i make fun of my teachers because i m comfortable with them maybe we should talk about that and i mean i can do it because we love each other and it s okay it s unconditional so even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other i m scared so going back to what lina was saying at the beginning and what tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing i felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma she makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today and not to say that it s not a giant problem but i feel like one can be passively anti racist whilst working actively towards anti poverty anti hunger anti war and making a difference in the world whether it s in the field of racism or not and then going back to what tomas said about the and i lost my point what was it it ll come back to me who wants to go i think tatum would agree with you and she would even i think say that while you re actively combating say poverty you are having a positive impact for say poor african american families and she points out the correlation statistically speaking between ethnicity and class but one thing i want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that i think that one thing that it means to become an adult and i m thinking what holly said is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants and i think it s really as simple as that what tatum is asking of people that she s asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you i want to hear from other people i got my point for tomas it s coming back it came back to me i had two points when i asked for the yarn then i forgot one of them and i just remembered it i want to encourage other people to speak up too and we ve got 10 minutes left there s a lot of voices that haven t been heard yet today what i m gonna do is something that i m gonna encourage other people to do too i m gonna toss it to somebody who s not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard i ll keep it short and then i ll throw it to someone okay toss it to somebody who doesn t have their hand raised though so back to what tomas said about the confrontational thing is it s really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing and it s the fear of the reaction of either one of those that i think stops most people from speaking up like either confrontation or you re appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more so samuel yeah sure well i was gonna say out of what chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually i think while sometimes it contributes to racism and i have a problem with telling too many off color jokes and gender related jokes but i think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff so if you look at people like comedians say like dave chappelle how many can say that he s a racist person because he makes lots of race based jokes in his comedy on the contrary i think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out when tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there s no such thing as being passively anti racist i think what she means by that is like it s sort of hard i actually got to mention you know our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is unweighted or whatever it s kinda difficult to how should i say it i don t know what i was trying to say i can t put it out into words but anyways i kinda agree and disagree with her it s like you can do little things to change however what i was trying to say is that it s a lot out there and it may be difficult that was all i was trying to say i don t even know here you go what i would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we re addressing it sorta kinda in a way but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society and then for some people that say it that aren t actually trying to make a difference it s like i mean it s gonna be hard to make a change and be like hey let me correct that because to them it s just like all fun and games but to us it s like okay yeah it stopped it died i agree completely with what laticia is saying although for instance how sam was saying about dave chappelle although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner it s not like people make jokes so people understand that oh we need to break these stereotypes i ve come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it obviously yes by making these stereotypical jokes yes we re addressing it but my point i guess is just it doesn t necessarily prove that people are anti racist alright i just wanted to say the question the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti racist and it s because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being from when we re born we re exposed to racism consistently and because of that we can t be passively anti racist our default setting for the most part is being racist not overly racist but we are so it s not possibe just to not be racist by being alive once you come to being in this world you are racist you can t change that so that s why there s no such thing as being passively anti racist you have to work at being anti racist it just doesn t happen so i completely agree with what wyatt s saying the way i look at racism is it s like a poison and once you ve been injected or you know whatever to it it stays in your system forever and there s always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there s always gonna be a little bit of it in you so before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it which would be parents or teachers i don t know i m a source of it you know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like oh yeah my teacher said this and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around i don t know it s not you i m just saying i don t believe you yeah i agree with wyatt and brooks because i think that we were talking about how disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says basically right there are always implicit messages which aren t necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things there are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples speaking so everyone s totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words so yeah if someone s gonna hit you in the face it might as well be this i want to go back to what brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism i mean how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists they don t even try they might just give you some parental info on your surrounding or just say those joke you were talking about so you re saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids i m saying that parents should know how to combat racism and they don t even try going back to what ryan said earlier i agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich so people won t want to use it anymore,0.0

you win good job give me five give me five give shanidra five good job guys,0.0
in the lion king like i was thinking about it there s no democracy in any of the movie no there isn t yeah and how the lion king s like everything seems really british you know like very england monarchy type stuff but in the lion king what bothered me is when it said like the two hyenas like cheech from cheech and chong was one of them and then whoopi goldberg was the other one i was just like how could they do that and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas like don t they think about that stuff yeah i was thinking the same thing did you think about it before when you first read cinderella i think when i watched the lion king like i thought about it i mean even when i was little i think it registered in my mind like that s a black woman s voice why would her voice be in this animal and not any of the other voices right i don t know disney intentionally did this they were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes so i think the mentality of that was why fix what s not been broken and when they should have fixed it but at the same time mufasa was that really what s his name james earl jones who s like morgan freeman right mufasa was an evil like if i had to pick a god it would be james earl jones or morgan freeman mufasa was the good simba s father right yeah with like the really deep voice you made a good point though about no democracy in disney movies there isn t because there s no democracy in marketing there s no democracy in the media what are the six big media conglomerates disney disney ge what else ge ge newscorp yeah newscorp then viacom viacom time warner and time warner but why can t cinderella be a first lady why does she have to be a queen like why can t she have some other magical power why can t we instill some like actual life in there but that s still not this is still not the classic but then i wouldn t be surprised if disney will come up with another story i hope they do well they came up with tiana right which added the gender stereo the roles the racial roles or the racial stereotypes tiana is absolutely beautiful the image however there are again the pre existing culture and norms that disney is too scared to move away from because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry i did promise you a reading on we do have time i promised you a reading on china as to what happens in china before i do that i just want your input on the disneyfication of children s culture with the article that you read i know you wanted to talk about it you were really excited if you have your article in front of you you can use that you can look at it i also jotted down plenty of notes but when you reflect on what we did today i want you to think these books these books are books are media music is media videos are media okay food for thought for next time when we have our discussion does media construct an image or a message there s no right or wrong answer but think about it does the media construct an image or a message okay as you read your read articles so hannah to you go ahead the whole like aladdin where how they changed the verse the lyrics that was like awful that was crazy like i think i have a different opinion from everybody like truth hurts to me i think it s just like i don t care that it says that like i didn t notice that no one notices that while they re singing like while they re singing that no one like realizes oh cut off your ear kids don t like if your was in and that actually happened back then that actually happened the ear one didn t bother me as much because that s kind of true but the whole it s barbaric the like that was awful it shouldn t be because if you think about where it is if you look into the history it is barbaric and they used to do it and in some places they still do it it s the whole hammurabi an eye for an eye you know it s that culture yeah it s true it s true so why not teach what actually happened but i don t really have a problem with it i mean like but if that s the only way that you re looking at the middle east then that s wrong because they have a history with beautiful art they invented math and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff that you can t just look at the problems that they have now or the violence that was in their culture because there s violence everywhere i mean that s just stereotyping they cut people s ears off in the middle ages in england just as much as they did or at least as the same they did worse things probably in the middle ages than they did in cutting off people s ears it s just unfair that they portayed the middle east like strictly as a barbaric violent place in that song it just makes it wrong i think it was like in general and it was because arabia was so bad in an oasis like that yeah they weren t specific it was just arabia but like it took there was like indian things about aladdin that it wasn t supposed to be india it was supposed to be like israel or totally different there were a lot of like middle eastern elements rolled into one so it would make one thing like if you went to the middle east if you went to like pakistan it wouldn t be what they say it is or if you went to india or you went to israel like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one which looks like a different why did they do that what would you think they didn t look into it they didn t bother to do the research yeah they probably didn t because their culture is so different than american culture that they just thought that they could just skip over it like i thought it was gross that they didn t even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript like if it was in english they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper but they just you think that you can just go like this on the board and that looks like arabic writing that s not arabic writing is really complicated and the whole thing with all the accents how all the bad guys had accents and the good guys didn t the bad guys had like oh the beards and noses bigger beards and then the good guys they looked american i think it made you assume the worst like reading that just made me like wow like oh my gosh it s not really giving you the information but yet you didn t notice it when you watched it though right yeah i mean you didn t at all i did though but then when we re older we go back in history maybe that s because i have that class and we realized that it s all war with religion and like i know those times go ahead religion what about it she noticed that i did notice those things like you can kind of tell like different culturally wise like the different indian elements in israel or the different like pakistani influences but and they had like hindu going on it s just really really weird but i did notice that but like i don t know maybe like hannah said she didn t notice that but because she didn t grow up like learning to write arabic no and like reading about all that stuff i guess it s also like how you grew up right someone who showed america like without photos i have a question when you think about it when we talk about american culture we view it as pretty homogeneous of the american values okay there are these values and that s all there is but we know that that s not true do you find that to be with these movies by blending all of those different spaces and all those different cultures do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children that the middle east is highly diverse okay and not everybody looks the same or writes the same or behaves the same but disney has done something that the media does what does the media assume that everybody who watches a movie is going to react the same way it s going to react the same way right so the media assumes that homogeneity attitude yes the problems in the past 20 years in the middle east like when little kids grow up and it s like if i look at a picture of osama bin laden i think jafar because he has a beard and he looks like that like we re taught that that is evil do you really i don t that the person with the turban and beard is evil because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world just happen to be muslim totally extremist muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don t practice kind of like most christians during the middle ages didn t go out and chop people s heads off in the name of jesus it s the same thing right you know but we look at those pictures of those middle eastern men and we think bad because of it which is like jafar and aladdin that s when acceptance comes in like you have to accept what s true and what s not exactly talk about ignorance i mean why do we have to accept that because it s not true because it s not true there are thousand and thousands you don t see me going like oh i m making bombs i m not like saying acceptance like it s not true i m not like saying acceptance like osama bin laden like accepting that s what he looks like to like jafar like that s who he was so that s what he looks like you know what i m saying yeah but i don t see that if i see if i look at osama bin laden i don t see jafar no i don t either i don t identify it at all i don t either but you know what i m saying yeah like little kids like 10 years from now if they watch aladdin and they re going to grow up and what s going to be in the news is september 11th and osama bin laden but what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else like ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid and still done all the horrible things that she did to ariel right like it doesn t matter what you look like they create these evil images of people like all old ladies are either really smart or they re evil they either have wisdom or they re out to get you there s no in between or the zoo keeper in he had a german accent he was evil and that was during a war the movie or like the three crows right that were talking in like the very like i don t know african american inner city slang and they were just all that stuff that was just really it kinds of makes it like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like we have that image like up here like tell them it looks like this so when we see them we automatically assume like oh man it could be a terrorist just like when we watch a movie like oh that s the bad guy so like it s the same as if they re doing a cartoon and if we re in real life right so that leads to problems that we have with profiling for example putting people on one side or yes it doesn t really relate to the article but i was watching a movie with my mom and i don t know what it was called but there s this like i guess class project or oral presentation that someone had to do and this girl chose to write about her religion which she was muslim and she wrote about like 9 11 and she was like just because they did that doesn t mean we re all evil and like i don t know she had all this stuff and then the principal like told the fbi or something and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from just because of that that s it that s when like a school needs to teach acceptance that s not the end or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber and like go kill yourself or are you gonna bomb all of us and we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion i remember when i was in sixth grade there was a girl she was muslim and people used to throw markers at her and stuff and call her a terrorist it was around 9 11 and stuff like that and it used to like upset me because i used to feel really bad because she like didn t do anything she barely even knew how to talk they d like throw markers at her and stuff just because she was muslim like because like no one has acceptance like no one learns that it s just like people make inferences like oh man it s a bad person so let s stay away let s shy away let s make fun of them instead of like when you re going down the street and just like we were talking about earlier how there s like if you see a big black man you re gonna put your phone away you re going to take your phone out and try to call your mom put her on speed dial you don t have acceptance either like you may say we should get it but you don t have it it s just the way we grow up we don t suspend judgment you don t suspend judgment it s difficult to do so there is this conflict between acceptance and our values because the values that we have that think by this individualistic view of what it is and in doing so you divide people into groups and construct images about those people and it s as simple as reading a children s story okay or as watching or turning the tv on in the morning and just watching the disney channel or noggin or nick jr or whatever there s messages that we impart on our children there s messages that we impart on ourselves or picking up the newspaper i don t know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper but there is a big there s a dichotomy between how different areas are described immediate areas our city compared to our surrounding areas right so media is biased they re systemically biased okay there is no democracy but here is the fundamental thing as an american we pride ourselves in democracy we pride ourselves in leadership so what do you do what path do you follow how do you,0.0
i can go into group two because that except this one is like these two are like both like pop these two are kinda like both pop because water s not bubbly this one s bubbly and this one s coca cola or dr pepper do you have a secret rule to use we re gonna get like one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles because they re kinda the same okay and this one like so i m gonna make sure i m understanding what your rule is gonna be does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container it s the bubble bubbles and stick to the side yeah okay so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side is that right yeah okay great alright alright friends in order to be closer together to really see how this is going to work i m going to ask anagelia s group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here go ahead and bring your liquids with you thank you very much and what we re going to do is we re going to set up our rule so that it s up here at the front so actually anagelia if you don t mind callie and natalie if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then anagelia s going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here okay thank you so we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table for your what s my rule okay so you re thinking of your property and you re going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don t fit the property here who would like to go first who would like to start okay so ryan s group ryan s group come up and set up one that fits your rule just a minute ryan isabella needs to come with you one that fits your rule here and one that doesn t fit your rule here just one just one one in each okay thank you you can be seated okay so we have this one fits their rule this one doesn t fit their rule i can tell bryson s already thinking about what it could possibly be this one can fit their rule hold on one second that s where we re going but wait one second okay let s talk about what we see any ideas so far of what might be going on here bryson do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space the bubbles on the top okay so you think it has something to do with bubbles do you have one that fits bubbles that one he s got a hypothesis now lena he s got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be do you think this fits the rule yeah okay so now we need to check in with isabella and ryan does that fit the rule yes it does okay it doesn t fit my rule so your rule should be the same as your partner s do you remember what that rule was ryan yeah okay great alright so anagelia thanks for raising your hand do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn t fit the rule thank you callie callie will you check in with isabella and ryan and see if that fits isabella does that fit the rule yes okay anybody else who s ready to bring one up oh another rule another one that might fit or doesn t fit rigo would you like to try which one do you think would go with this group which ones from the ones you have would go with this group bryson giving you a hint no that one doesn t that one here so you think both of these fit the blue one just the blue one because look at this one it doesn t leave white bubbles okay so if that one doesn t fit the rule where would it go rigo where would this one go this one over here right just hold that thought for a just a second no this one we said does fit it right isabella and ryan are we on track so far yes okay anagelia did your group have another one to bring up okay that one you think fits in this side fits the rule and callie you think this one doesn t fit the rule look when it shakes doesn t do anything okay okay natalina do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us what s going on here i think it s the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group when you shake it it has lots of bubbles that one doesn t okay so let s go back a minute though because you said two different things sit on your botton rigo first you said bubbles and not bubbles and then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it is that the same rule or is that different is the shaking part important do you think to that rule okay so can you state it one more time for us when you shake it if there s bubbles it will go that one if it doesn t go bubbles it goes in that one okay and isabella and ryan is that correct yup excellent so the shaking was the really important part of that great at least for this one it s weird right because right now this one has no bubbles but if i shake it it gets bubbles later okay excellent can you remember which ones you had in your group yes can you come and get them i m not sure if i can i m glad you can remember can you remember rigo which one you put out there this no that one s ours no this is ours um yeah one two three four five i think you ve got five these ones are originally from isabella and ryan i think yeah isabella and ryan can you come back and get yours great alright which partnership is ready to tell to not tell but to do another secret rule i thought i brought a blue did you think you brought a blue one you figured it out okay natalina s group can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule natalina you want to check that one more time make sure that s correct okay this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier and let s leave this on the table anagelia can you remind what the rule is stick to the sides anagelia can you remind callie what the rule is too go remind callie so these two do fit right alright show us one that doesn t please okay careful with the liquids please you okay alright we actually got a little extra help here now didn t we we got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not isabella do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn t fit the rule ryan can you sit on your bottom again please watch what isabella is doing oh cool see if you agree ryan watch what isabella s doing and see if you agree okay i agree natalina callie and anagelia thumbs up is that correct did she put it in the right place yeah okay good bryson and rigo do you guys have one that you want to put in yeah more than one more than one okay oh three oh go ahead if you think that s right i think that s right rigo rigo can you tell us why you put these two here because it can bubble bubbles in it because they have bubbles in them does this does not just a second just a second callie does this one have bubbles in it yes it does so it s not bubbles and no bubbles you re on the right track though take a look again ryan do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here stuff on the side and this one it goes away after awhile maybe this is the rule thank you ryan so far so good yeah okay yeah let s bring up all the rest oh bryson you can go ahead and leave those there you can go ahead and leave those there i think we re okay actually if you have any other liquids to bring up this one bring them on up and put them where they belong and we ll see if we can figure out what the rule is bring it on up bring it on up ryan bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes this one s confusing ooh a confusing one i love a confusing one do you know why because it helps you think it helps you think exactly it makes it more difficult to figure out would you like to consult with someone do you want to consult with ryan ryan come here a minute your partner needs your help she s trying to figure out where this one goes what do you think i think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one now remember we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule because look this one has bubbles this one if i shake it has bubbles so bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule okay thanks for your help ryan anybody else give isabella some assistance here well you know the rules already right anagelia what do you think anagelia which one do you think it goes in listen to anagelia rigo what s your opinion what do you think does it go in this group or this one what do you think even though you know what the rule is can you help her figure out how to classify it rigo are you watching what do you think it goes in in that one that one in this group right here okay what do you think isabella you want bryson s idea what does bryson think i think it goes in that one because because most of them kind of move when you shake them but when you shake those they don t oh interesting let s try that out okay okay ryan come a little closer to me right now please we re trying out something different bryson just said the ones rigo you can stay where you are you re right close by no bryson just said something really interesting he just said stand on your own two feet please thank you he just said that these ones don t move when you shake them and these ones do move when you shake them and that s how they re classified so i want to just double check that i make sure that i agree with what you re saying okay bryson does this one move when i shake it not really i can t really try it out okay see what you think it kinda does does this one move when you shake it yes yes okay oh it sticks on the walls ah ha so are you amending your rule are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides yes so this group right here is ding ding ding ding ding ding this group right here is the one s that stick on the sides yes ding ding ding ding ding ring the bell ring the bell but we still haven t figured out even if we know that that s what the secret rule is where does this one go that one that one that one okay natalina let s take your opinion first rigo we re listening to natalina and then we ll hear from you okay go ahead natalina i don t think it follows our rule it does you think it s totally out here it s separate it s not in either category no i don t think it goes in this one you don t think it goes in this one no i do think it goes because because it doesn t really stick to the walls it doesn t really stick to the walls okay you wanna hold it make sure stick to the other opinions other opinions anagelia i couldn t hear you could you say it louder so the group can hear you go ahead it should go there because when you move it some parts stick to the wall and some parts when you move it it sticks to the part it does stick to the walls yeah okay it s dirty isabella what do you think i think it should go in this one because it kind of it sticks to the wall at first and then it goes down so and then doesn t stick to the wall okay it sticks to the wall first and then it doesn t so you think it goes in this one may i have it just for a minute one thing i m noticing that s a little confusing for me if i look at this one compared to all the others this is the only one that s not colored in this group does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they re colored somehow so this one s not as sticky because it s less colored maybe i don t know so you re saying it sticks at first but then not so much after that can we tell how much this one sticks no yeah yeah it really sticks it really sticks how about this one can you tell how much this one sticks yeah it kinda sticks that does stick most of it some of it that does so it sticks but it is most of it goes away and some stays some goes away and some stays,0.0
negative x minus it it s one over oh wait oh wait wait wait wait how do we solve for x x is the value of r anyway x is the value of r what would you do for the one over x wouldn t that be the first term x is the value of r what i would suggest you do is is that you could rewrite this as an expression oh as the power oh oh okay okay i used oh yeah yeah all right yeah i got it so it s gonna be negative x minus one okay okay no i got it so the first it s gonna be so what whatever oh come on i just wanted to find where it talks about it would be one minus one oh we have one is one over x the sum do you see see what i m saying yeah i m gonna put it in there so negative x minus one cause later it s gonna change wait you don t really have to do it out since it s gonna change the so it s higher you ll have to you gotta yeah no no no no no don t don t don t don t don t even do that do you know why because it s part of a well yeah yeah yeah cause the whole thing is negative and then that s the remember the he s a natural but now here s the question you guys kind of already answered this question could you have found it they give you basically r is two x uh huh and since it converges it has to be less than the absolute value of you got it okay that makes sense go back for a second yeah you multiply both sides by a third so it d be one third times every single one of em and the interval um oh maybe someone s it means it s gonna get shifted and then you were just scaling the because it s like i d never i never considered oh okay yeah it s not gonna change the domain of the oh no no i m putting plus negative the answer yeah so the only thing i m thinking is it might be easier for you to just it might make sense somehow oh how do you read yeah how do you no no no no no no no no it doesn t reduce the time it takes for it to no man right oh okay yeah one third oh i get it i get it it only converges as you no matter what well no matter what one over x three x five x two in two over x i think it does thank you you re welcome that s what i m yeah that s what i m saying one over x because what they want you to do now so you d say power series is gonna be written as a form of say geometric series because now you ve got what what s the first term yeah right okay what s the ratio negative and when you write that out put around it let him once show him okay is it saying three x i would be i would take the are you sure you re working together yes and i ll turn it one we got one minus x squared one over one plus x squared that s x to the fourth right minus x to the sixth plus x to the eighth this is if you are indexing this this is your first term this is your second term this is your third term right think about the first one okay we have left that in order to get that a two x like the first r okay the first side of it and say it s the second term that the first time so it s probably gonna probably gonna be it probably okay at least on these simple ones okay okay leave that for okay n minus one over one minus one x minus one would be zero which would be originally we have negative one x minus one the right one so it s either gonna be now you re expanding by three instead of zero six so it s like negative x squared switched so the negative that goes over here is negative x squared too so the negative is which y i don t uh i don t know what i m doing all right look hold on isn t it the same as the third one that means that the y like the same one y is the common one right to the one so this would be x minus one and negative just put in one here four all right what s the ratio here one you re multiplying the outside of two x another one you re doing it as the two x that means you re moving the x to the inside if you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple if you take arcsine of x any function you want and you multiply it by scale like one third one fourth ah but then there we said no oh my god what arc what are you wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on there s gonna be another one i haven t there and one third after that is what we re doing here our r remains the same it s the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third okay yeah i m agreeing to that i m pretty sure that s right you multiply this out it s gonna be one over three plus three x minus one why are you multiplying it out just think of it as a scale it s not anything to do it s not gonna affect our domain outside the function it s only gonna affect the range and therefore you re not gonna have any remains cause the remains only matter if you didn t have but like one third of it so we re not doing it like that one third after it we re doing like a stretched version so it s not gonna affect the equation so it s negative x what no no no no no no that s the series for uh all right i m just negative x squared right no no no i m putting negative x squared it s easier cause then later on when you do plus no no no no no i the sine s been switching no no yeah but you can represent that by saying yeah it s gonna be smaller well it ll be switching but like would you represent how would you represent x in the whole thing to the negative see the n minus one is put that s how i m doing it wait how would you find the if it s the absolute value of x minus one it would be less than one mrs dockin yes is this is this is this x we re not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change what is x over r take this series right here which is that so then integrate it we just though you integrate every term to get it now you re looking for a general expression right you have a general expression it didn t tell you to come up with no they didn t tell you to do that oh okay okay okay because in fact that s not a power series that s not a power series it is okay but it s a different form of a power series so you don t have to write em like this because you would also need to have what you also have to have right yeah okay got it okay you flip it around one good yeah good what s r the negative of yeah you re the negative x plus one but it needs to be in parentheses so now you need your r okay now you re gonna do them when you get to it needs to be a form of k over r oh i thought we just solve for r you said the third nominated was r all right guys she said 1 3 times one whatever that is how do you multiply these does it need to be on the yeah so you do it again yeah multiply the whole interval yeah multiply the interval and this is not in the form of a series that one third does that impact the greatness of one that s the question you want to answer i m not answering it for you right now you need to figure it out so when it s asking for does the function of the this it s like that you didn t divide it by seven,0.0
trying to find meaning for their lives or were they just trying to what were they questing for do you think well gilgamesh was questing for like immortality and that was for him and not really his people but theseus i think was i don t know i think theseus was just trying to help the people of athens i don t think either of them were really looking to find that but they both ended up finding it i think both of them were like looking to help their people and then i also think like a small part of them was looking for glory i think it s kind of like looking for their destiny like they know they re meant for something bigger but they don t know what it is yet so they re just looking for what that is so then he goes to take the test and the test kills him or not then he goes back to his father and he realizes that he s just like you know the father s really disappointed in the son and then he s really disappointed until the son i think it could happen in today s society i don t know about gilgamesh well yeah it was a really like abstract connecting in the really broad sense it could happen but like like the story line but when you look at details then like no but i mean minotaurs don t exist so it probably couldn t happen but like you were saying like metaphorically it could be something that you know like the storyline could happen but metaphorically you could compare anything that s true can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically like me no the only one was like you mean hypothetical theseus not like he goes and fights a minotaur and when he comes back he s like not dead but his dad thinks he s dead and kills himself but it s like haley said i guess thanks if you have like a test and like you re bad like a difficult situation in general yeah and like your dad or parents or someone are like you can get through this like you can beat it and they think that you or like they think that you fail it or like catastrophe fail it or they think you do then they re gonna be kind of disappointed in you but like they re not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test but still you can laugh if it was someone else but maybe like on the inside he s dying yeah your turn okay i just said what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times well the probably the whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed at least like in the to the culture like the gods and goddesses aren t like a you know big deal yeah i think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are not like in charge but that are higher up in our society like the government people and like parents and i just think more like mentors in general yeah like people that are higher than us like anyone technically could like you know that you look up to that you rely on for help it s like a figure rather than like yeah a physical yeah god god yeah well my question was show the similarities and differences between theseus and his father ooh okay so i think like they both kind of they re very different in their terms of like loss and like failure because like when theseus s dad like thought that he was like dead then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide but when like theseus like was with ariadne or whatever and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur then he just kind of you know left her on an island i think that i don t really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on crete seven maidens and seven children but like i just think that because that happens and because he does that every year i think theseus is a better leader he s just like better in charge of i think that they re definitely like different rulers too because like theseus is more like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against thebes but doesn t try to like most people would like try to steal stuff from the city but he s just going to like bury the dead and then he leaves so like that s more of a nicer leader i guess whereas his dad wasn t really like put in that situation but i m guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city and not include people very often it says that because he lived with his mom so he didn t want to have a son so then when he could lift the rock then he could come over and meet his dad is this question number no we re still asking predict what would happen if king aegeus and enkidu hadn t died if the king hadn t died i think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after and there would have been no like not formed you know what i m talking about because king aegeus no but he would have died sometime and then theseus would have taken over yeah that s true can you go dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy what did you mean by that oh just like right when king aegeus died theseus came over and said we re going to have a democracy instead of me ruling over all of you so like we don t know if that would have happened or because if he just would have stayed alive he could have like changed theseus mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea mm hmm yeah he would ve wanted him to be he would have that as king he would ve been more like his dad yeah that s true but if enkidu didn t die then gilgamesh would probably like be happy and then like conquer a bunch of other stuff and like they would probably like die together she could have sent him to athens to claim him as his oh okay nevermind you re allowed to go on all right no if enkidu didn t die though i just think that gilgamesh wouldn t have really known like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning i think he still was kind of arrogant until enkidu died so he he would have stayed like that yeah he would have stayed that way mm hmm because he went through like a stage of depression so yeah do you think that each one reached humility at the end or no do you think that gilgamesh you said was still arrogant even at the end no oh he wasn t not after enkidu died but once he died it stopped of course but i think gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn t going to be immortal well yeah that too because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn t live forever he couldn t do whatever he wanted who s your favorite character between each story out of the stories theseus yeah i like theseus too we all like theseus yeah it also said that theseus was grieving was grieving her loss or his father s loss it was both debate which character had more impact on their society can you say that one more time debate which character had more impact on their society oh she has the debate word in there okay let s hear it i d say gilgamesh i would say he wants to be king let s let him finish his reason what s your reason you think who i think gilgamesh actually i think theseus would because he changed the kind of structure of government and made it democratic that s it yeah i would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived while kind of gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story while theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind that people remembered on high rather than as like a low point of their society weren t you going to say something oh i was i thought you were i think theseus was had an impact and the reason for that because he like survived more than gilgamesh did and he helped people out of the maze with adrian s help right yeah predict what would happen if the king and enkidu didn t die well i don t think athens would be democratic i don t think the king would have done it yeah he probably would have been poisoned why is that gilgamesh i don t know because gilgamesh probably wouldn t have been searching for immortality yeah he wouldn t have gone on that journey yeah okay well my question is how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through wait what was the question how would you have handled the situations wouldn t have done any of them no i get scared really easily and stressed so that would not be good the labyrinth thing sorry i didn t hear what you said i wouldn t go to the labyrinth thing why is that it kind of sounds like a bad idea i might go and just not defeat the beast and in the first place i probably would have traveled by water and not just said i m too good for that it s too easy because i bandits have sharp swords yeah okay what s yours choose your favorite character and explain why from because you like gilgamesh or theseus okay oh not like our favorite character just in the story yeah well either way it doesn t really matter well because my favorite character from gilgamesh was enkidu is that how you say it because i think he like really changed gilgamesh for the better and helped him and humbled him do you agree with that yeah i agree with that because i feel like he was kind of like gilgamesh was so awful and like enkidu came in and just changed all that plus i thought that it was kind of cool his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy yeah i don t think that enkidu really meant to change gilgamesh though i think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen enkidu s mom kind of made that happen too didn t he did you feel like enkidu was just kind of created that he i mean we were saying that we like him but did he seem real to you or was he just something created see when i read it the entire time he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix gilgamesh so he didn t really have that much of a personality to me so that s my opinion i don t know yeah he seemed like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out gilgamesh and he did yeah he did my favorite character from these stories was ariadne oh well because i didn t feel sorry for her because she helped theseus and like without her he would have been trapped in the labyrinth but then to repay her he just ditched her on an island and just left her so that wasn t very nice so i feel sorry for her that s why okay mine is how would you have dealt with these situations in can you repeat it one more time how would you have handled these situa i wouldn t run away from the i would not have gone on this journey i probably just would have stayed home not gonna lie do you feel like that people to be great have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements that that s what greatness is not necessarily i don t think you necessarily have to seek them it all really depends on what your definition of greatness is i feel like to get that like glory and all that i mean i think you can do that if you have enough impact where you are you don t need to go off on a journey what do you think dinesh i don t know i feel like if we re going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories that obviously you don t have to i don t think you have to seek greatness necessarily i don t think you have to seek it to find it but i think that you do have to go off if you re just going to stay where you are you re not really going to be able to achieve it so if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by that s not greatness that can t constitute,0.0
so does percent always have to be 100 no because i see none of the percents up here are 100 they re all lower than 100 so you think a percent can either be 100 or less yes okay okay so that means you think this can be called an improper okay ian three fourths and the decimal 0 75 are the same what do you mean by the same one s a decimal one s a fraction well i mean like they re equivalent ah equivalent so does that go back to what alana said alana which ones did you have there one half and 5 so you re saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with one half and 5 10 yeah okay alana no well i did one fourth three fourths 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters ah you did one fourth what was the other one one wait one fourth three fourths all right 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters ah okay quarters i can think of money quarters or yeah 25 cents 75 cents yeah 25 cents is one quarter 75 cents is three quarters three quarters one quarter excellent good good ian everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal oooh so you found a way to connect every single one of them so everything can be made into say it again a percent fraction or decimal interesting so you re saying that i can take this percent and write it as a just a percent or as a what else fraction and decimal so okay he s connecting all he thinks all three of them can become equivalent from the views before excellent ian six fourth one fourth and three fourth they all have a denominator of four ah yeah what does that mean that they all have a denominator of four well they re all like sets of fourths what does a denominator represent in a fraction the um bottom number when we write it as the bottom number when we re literally writing it what does it actually represent what s that for how many equal parts it s split into ah the number of equal parts it s split into so let me go back to ian ian is saying that everything can be written as also as a fraction a decimal and a percent so can everything be in four parts what if it s in five parts does that matter i can do the five parts as a percent or i can do four parts as a percent yeah what about what alan said percent is it up to a hundred and that s it no depends on the range that you set it so can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100 well like when something you did in earth science we did to see if our grow dino grew over 600 good connection okay so what did that mean if it grew over 600 it like grew bigger than times over six hundred times its size yeah 600 times its size okay so is it possible so is that an improper percent no but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100 meybe we can t go over 100 what happened here you tell me about that percent it s less than one percent is that possible can you think of a real life example when you d have less than one percent about growing something expanding over and over to 600 times its size can you give a real life example of when i would have 0 when you fail a test oh well i could fail a test with 64 what does it mean if i fail a test with 0 other than i m in big trouble at home what does it mean what would that mean if you failed it with 0 what would that mean about what you did on the test you didn t get anything right yeah you got zero right nothing right didn t get a single question right can it be less than zero is this less than zero yeah no it s less than one so where is zero here tenths is that zeros no where s zeros between where would they go would they go in the ones place tens place ones in the ones place we have zero ones so is this less than zero yes no no no because it s 0 1 interesting okay so can i have less than zero percent no you can have a negative but if it s negative percent can you have a negative percent what do you think well i was going to say something could be like one point like point one percent less than something if you re comparing two things okay your percent of increase or decrease have you looked at that in earth science yet standard deviation okay we ll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase decrease i m talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent and whether that s below one or zero okay so can you give an example of where this could occur where i can have less than 1 it can occur i think with that fraction okay but that s just a made up can you give me something in real life that i could have less than 1 you can have an example of more than 100 so my question is does percent go from 100 to one or zero or is there anything less in between what do you think like a gas tank in your backyard okay like when you call in to get it filled and it s really low the meter s low and under one okay that s typically not going to be measured in percent it s going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank it s going to be a volume situation oh okay but we ll talk about that so let s keep that in mind we re still trying to find an example when we have less than 1 think of one alice like on the labels and stuff on the vitamins less than 1 of your recommended day or something i just so happen to have here vitamins you re right and there are some examples when if i take this i m not going to get my daily 1 i m going to get less than that but there s some of these in here ooh like if i take one of these i get 100 of vitamin c now i drank a glass of orange juice this morning when i took my vitamin what happened to the percent of vitamin c where s it at it went over 100 over 100 so there s a real life when i can get over 100 of something anybody get over 100 on a quiz or test ever over and how do you get that bonus ah bonus questions so we re good with coming up with more than 100 but we re still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it s less than one percent so we ll go back to that any other connections let s see if we can connect the ones we haven t done yet anything with the leftover ones one fifth and 20 are equal okay box right there they re equivalent to each other right how did you know they were equivalent because one fifth of 100 is 20 okay she did one fifth of 100 because we think of again we keep going back to a hundred for 100 is 20 out of 100 excellent what else one tenth and 10 ah what can you say about one tenth and 10 they re equivalent again equivalent going to go back to ian ian they re finding the percent and the decimal but there s no fraction there fraction with a percent but there s no decimal is there a third for all of them you said there s an equivalent fraction decimal percent for all of them no but there can be the decimal would be so what would you like to add here ian let s go to the which one you pick one find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we re missing well 150 and six fourths is equal okay do we think they equal each other no yeah yeah convincing but not yet you haven t convinced everybody do you think that equals okay four fourths would equal 100 and one fourth each fourth is 25 and if it s two over then i ve got two fourths left over and that d be 50 and they can also equal 0 5 so now we need the decimal piece 1 5 what did you say alan uh two fourths can equal 0 5 so what do you think six fourths give me the decimal that i ll put here we agree that these are equal 1 5 oh so there is a decimal that goes there how d you get 1 5 oh because one and a half got it see where the half came from you said ruby you had told us that one half and five tenths were equal so if we have that one half here we do the same thing we combine it here to get the 50 okay so any others what s the missing piece ian uh you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like another well pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece one in one thousands one thousandths one thousandths and 0 1 ah are these equivalent no yes no you re going to have to convince them ian it s the day of ian convincing i don t know they are why do you say they are because one percent over a hundred well because that s tenth that s not thousandths it s not one tenth it s one tenth of a percent so here s another question then are those equivalent no no so be careful that s not one tenth that s one tenth of a percent so could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one thousandths yes yeah but when you divide it by 100 ah so we keep hearing divide and multiply by a hundred so when i convert from a percent to a decimal or percent to a fraction i m using powers of what ten ten so the question is is that the equivalent to that yeah how do you want to do it ava um can you fill in the missing piece can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here with a missing decimal that i have i have the percent and i have the fraction but we think we re going to get all three of them can you tell me what decimal that is um zero and one thousandth how did you get that um divide by 100 ah dividing by 100 what do you notice happens when we divide by 100 it goes back okay when we divide it it moves two decimal places and the decimal place moves two places over so did that happen so are we convinced that these three are now equal yes can we see that now but you divide 0 1 you divide it by a hundred to get oh yes you re changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that okay yeah now that ava gave us the decimal is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other yes because now you when you read that you read it as what one and one one thousandths so are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction decimal percent for every fraction every decimal and every percent yes so why do we have all three why not do everything in fractions do everything in percents or do everything in decimals why do we have in real life all three things going on alice because for some things it s easier to picture it in percent in decimal okay so picturing a visual to go with it can you think of an example of one we use or in real life well like with money it s like easier to think that it s going to be 25 cents or 0 25 than like 25 of a dollar yeah wouldn t that be interesting if they said how much is that salad today well it s something percent of a dollar okay ian well with fractions one third is equal to 0 333 and keep going ah so if we did with fractions or decimals we might have some repeating,0.0
so how is that energy different things like jules which are increments which are similar kilowatts hours and bcu okay you could also measure it with a thermometer if it s kinetic energy sometimes okay i have an cubic feet tons and gallons too that s mass and volume oh cause it was like hold on totally different thing i don t remember while she s looking at that what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about well there are no no explosions that s a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power oh i have and it states in lots of articles about nuclear waste that it produces very little waste at all well i have a cubic feet it s for like natural gas tons is measured for coal kilowatts hours is for electricity it doesn t pollute the air you could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it and then the disadvantages for geothermal energy is the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15 which isn t it s not that great and there s a limitation of it you can t just like keep reusing it and reusing it i think that would be like a possibility for a scenario but like we don t know if it s warm enough to be able to do that yeah if there was a good spot around our area it might be good but how would you know if your area was a good spot i don t know they would have to do tests and stuff plus i don t know that people would want it in their backyard it s hard because cranberry if we re thinking of where those people well like a civilized area people really don t want something that smells bad yeah that they don t want any disruption and where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from there are inside of the earth right but it s inside of the earth but it comes out in what ways in geysers in geysers or what else i m not sure volcanoes oh yeah so who that s definitely something you don t have volcanoes everywhere either yeah right and you definitely wouldn t want that in your backyard and sometimes if there would be a good area maybe the state or the country would buy the property to like put it there because it s a good spot sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff they like buy the property okay okay i had hydro electric and some of the pros that is it doesn t pollute at all and the actual running of the power plant is really cheap and then it s really reliable so say there was a big power outage in the area the hydro electric power plant could get that running again but it s run by building dams in rivers and they re extremely expensive to build which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that a different a business or something but it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals and people and houses i have a question for you do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here i don t think you could necessarily use the creek the connoquenessing yeah but yeah you have to have like a big river and it has to be fairly out of the way would it like cause flooding yeah you couldn t have any houses really upstream because could they d flood and for example your science book says that the hoover dam which is on the colorado river it created a waterfall of 400 feet which is more than twice as high as the niagara falls so you re talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop because the water creates the kinetic energy am i saying that right yeah and that s what causes the electricity correct so if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here that might that might work and again the whole yeah the three rivers that could do it because there s a bunch of big rivers in pittsburgh yeah yeah but if you build that up wouldn t that flood well not in the middle of the city you could maybe do it like out of the city cause the rivers aren t just like in the city they go out and also if you have a good area flooding wouldn t matter so much if you pick the right area which i mean i guess the whole thing so definitely not in cranberry here where we live well we get a lot of rain around here so i m just like flooding would be like a problem yeah we re sort of in a drought right now there s not been a big rain for a long time does it harm the animals that are in the river it s better for farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there s more fish and stuff but there s less plants and stuff like upstream it floods the animals and homes and so it doesn t really hurt too much down stream i guess it depends because the farmers need deeper waters but not if there s less life in it because that s what they re trying to achieve rachel tell us about yours my energy is fossil fuels the pros were that it s the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use it s easy to find if you know in the general area of where it s at it makes up half or more of our energy in the united states the cons are that it s non renewable there s a limited supply it makes a lot of pollution when it s mined it s expensive to transport it harms aquatic life with pollution it takes millions of years to form that s something i didn t know about fossil fuels that it takes a very long time to develop it has to be like compacted uh huh so maybe the big plant it might be able to not might be able it would probably run out fast if we started using it a lot so there wouldn t be a point in making this huge plant and then it just run out yeah so it might be something people would use more often in the future just little by little like just for little things what do you mainly use it for like energy but like what falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels coals and oils and natural gas yeah yeah and you said it when you mine it so we would have to transport it here there s so many people that live here that wouldn t want that isn t that what happened in mexico what s that called the gulf of mexico yeah weren t they mining for fossil fuels like oil oil yeah and that happens so that s like a natural disaster and that s happened a bunch of times so it s not that safe so for our scenario what do you think would be the best two maybe nuclear around here out of the way a little so it wouldn t create any huge explosions so thermal energy transfers into electrical energy so it s kind of like biomass cause they both you burn both of them except yours you use mine s not renewable yeah yours you use like uhm what s it called like plants fossilized plants and stuff and for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that actually isn t the isn t the fossilized or fossil fuels or whatever don t they keep on making them yeah fossilized yeah but it can t it takes so long to make them because you need all the pressure and the decomposing like plants and animals that once it runs out it s going to take a while for us to get more like thousands of years it takes to replenish yeah it takes a long time yeah it takes a very long time for sure so i think keeton i don t think yours would be the best for our community to use it s running out anyway yeah so how much pollution does it cause a lot why does the world just use it if it s running out why waste it we talked about the efficiency what s the efficiency cost of fossil fuels i wasn t sure i couldn t find the exact uh 38 to 47 that s actually really good cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something so that may have something to do with what your decision is right the efficiency of the energy i think so i just you should save some of it you don t need to save it but it s not that good of an idea to rely on this energy source that s not going to last forever that s why i say you could also use that as a backup plan because if we use something that s renewable like katelyn s or something but something like a disaster happens that could always be our just our fall back that we know we could use that if we have to just like an emergency generator it s like you know it s there if you need it you can use it and it can last for a little bit since it is running out would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case oh definitely save it save it i say save it too now i actually think save it because i think probably save it i would say to save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you ll be able to go back to it but if you use it all then you couldn t go back to it so what are you all proposing as your primary energy source biomass okay cause it doesn t cause that much pollution and then they harness that pollution like katelyn said they capture it and then they use it for different things like growing trees or cause the only thing that the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide and they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff wow interesting yeah i thought that was pretty good so i think katelyn s definitely provides the most for the community definitely out of all yeah i have high effiecency rates so you ll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it yeah the colorado river isn t actually renewable energy s that good of an efficiency rating actually actually the the hydro electric energy is nearly 95 efficient wow once you build it since tidal doesn t use any fuel either it s just once you built it but the down side on building is it costs so much so i don t understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things you could do it to create more biomass like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil plant roots or plants just try to find research to make that happen more quickly speed up the process so it wouldn t be a non renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything there s no they said the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that they only create like a small amount of energy and so we can t really do that in silicone valley what about the three rivers in pittsburgh could we not somehow harness that we were talking about that i was like talking about redirecting the river redirecting the river just making one big one yeah i think that we would be able to use the three rivers in pittsburgh because they re all pretty big rivers so if we just put like one dam in there and then we harness the energy from all three i think that we could get a lot of energy from it i don t think it d be enough energy like to completely rely on it i think that we d still have to use other resources to still create energy because i know the title it only creates 10 hours of energy a day but i don t know if that means like an hour of that energy runs like a power plant it didn t exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing so i don t i don t think that d be a good idea to completely rely on that and put it in the three rivers and doesn t then the with the title energy too there has to be a difference in the the low and high difference in the low and the high yeah three meters of low and high yeah so where did you find out where in the world there is that difference yeah they said the biggest title it was in france or something but we don t have any in the united states because we don t have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference oh wow so there s none used in the united states and i don t think we could use that then well what you were saying before about how like each energy source we basically have to fall back on another one yeah because none of them we could completely rely on to supply all of our energy i think that we would definitely need at least two choices at least two and if we had to pick two i would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way yeah like you only need a little bit and it can produce a lot of energy and the efficiency rating s pretty high it s like 35 so yeah wow that is pretty high remember you said it was like really hazardous yeah it doesn t produce a lot of air pollution or greenhouse gases but if like one small accident is made then it can cause like a really big disaster which would be bad for a community of people since there are so many people in it i think that katelyn and kelsey were talking about like different kinds of energy sources and according to issels uh issues,0.0
okay alright okay okay so that s his position he s going to stick with it for a minute but then he might have to go around he might change his mind alright okay this group agreed with fernando okay that it s because the earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter who would like to share they re thinking i ll call on you if you don t so what do you think well i think it s because since the earth like orbits around the sun like in an oval when it gets here it would be warmer because it s closer to the sun okay and it s winter when it s away from the sun okay so can you go and draw that on the board what you mean because i heard you say that the earth orbits around the sun in the shape of an oval raise your hand if you agree with that okay okay okay so that s the earth and it s orbiting around the sun and he said that the shape of the path that it travels as it orbits is an oval okay anybody else in this group has something to add to help him defend fernando okay i see can i read what you wrote sure he said that the orbit is not a perfect circle so that s sort of what he s saying there is that right yeah and how would it not being a perfect circle affect the difference in summer winter temperature or heat well we know that the earth if it was a perfect circle the seasons wouldn t change okay it would be the same alright okay depending where the earth is alright okay anybody else have something they want to add in this group okay now anybody based on these two groups anybody want to move from their group to these two groups not yet okay that s alright okay now let s go to raul okay this group agrees with raul and he says it s because the earth s tilt changes the angle of the sunlight hitting the earth defend yourselves so i remember learning that the tilt of the axis is the reason for the seasons but i read the question again it says the earth still changes and if it doesn t change it stays the same okay let s read it again read it really simple it says it s because the earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight hitting earth okay so it says the earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight yeah does it say it changes the tilt of the earth no okay so you going to stick with what you said or you want to change can you show me if i give you something can you show me what you mean alright okay so i m going to give you an apple and i want you to pretend it s the earth okay and i m going to stick this bamboo skewer through it well it didn t go exactly right but just pretend so what does this represent based on what you just said this is the axis of the earth so this is the axis and what does the axis do okay so the earth rotates around the axis which is what ryan said right okay and be careful because i just poked myself i want you to be careful okay so can you stand up and show me what you mean and let s have someone else in your group that agrees with you be the sun and stand kind of in the middle of the room right here okay alright so she s the sun you re the earth show us what you mean okay okay well the earth orbits the sun alright what s the word you were just about to say though revolves i think that might be okay too what do you guys think do you think revolve and orbit might be the same yeah okay alright it doesn t matter okay so you re going to have to make the go around the outside of the desk for your orbit okay well it orbits the sun in a tilt okay which one is tilt i forgot how many degrees okay alright okay so keep going it orbits in an angle alright hold it the way you think it s supposed to be okay i think it s this one i m pretty sure alright so she s tilting it but now and it s tilted right now it s away from the sun is that right yeah okay now keep coming around of course does it make a little job to play that no but we re just imagining those who were in this room okay now stop there for a minute is your axis pointing where you want it to yes okay alright keep going you guys need to make space for her to come through on her orbit okay alright so does that help some of you how many people think that she s right that the earth tilts as it s going around its orbit it s actually kind of spinning on its axis while it s going around right is that right yeah it s spinning the whole time right what does that spinning give us what does that spinning give us day and night the spinning gives us day and night okay right okay because one side of the earth is facing the sun it s what day and the other side is in night okay alright okay alright this group over here you guys agree with susan susan okay and susan said that she thinks it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in summer than in winter so what do you think so like she said that its axis is tilting but as it moves around the sun the northern and southern hemisphere are closer and farther away okay but on this side the southern hemisphere is closer alright and when it comes over here the northern hemisphere is closer in the sun and alright anybody else in this big room have something to add well i agree with her natalie because as it is tilted i believe that and so when it goes around the sun shines bright and as it s turning and so as it goes around it will change where the light is hitting it okay can someone add to that or give us more detail i m also pretty sure that like the state of texas it s more closer towards the equator and so it doesn t have all of the seasons okay so you think that places on the equator right here they don t have four seasons summer fall winter right i think they do have seasons they re just not as different as like okay so there s not much that difference in the heat from the sun and the winter versus the summer yeah i think they re always getting the same amount depending on the same amount of what the same amount of sunlight and heat because they re getting it directly almost okay alright why do you think that what makes you say that so you think the orbit is elliptical like this group fernando s group agreed but it s not enough to change the difference in temperature i don t think heat really varies depending on i mean it varies but not in that small of a scale depending on where it is and so just that little teeny movement ellipse or something will not change okay alright okay i think we have another group over here how about the shakira agree ers do you want to move now okay okay everybody if you want to move to a different table go for it now okay nobody agreed with warner huh okay so eva s out alright people don t think that it gives off more heat right in the summer than the winter in warner s group right so we re down to and shakira s out right alright who said to me that they didn t agree with any of them i changed my mind you changed your mind okay alright so here s what i want you to do now okay i want to do another little demonstration okay would you be the sun okay and would you be the earth now here s what i want you to do for me i want you to orbit around the sun i want you to pick a spot like let s say that yellow bucket okay and as you re going around i want you to keep the axis pointed at that yellow bucket no matter where you are can you do that yes alright give it a try alright alright now stop for a second right there okay he s still pointed at that yellow bucket right keep going alright stop right there he s still pointed pretty much at the yellow bucket and you re tilted over a little bit right like she said because we all kind of agree pretty much these two groups agreed with that what season is it right now in the northern hemisphere what season is it right now in the northern hemisphere winter winter why is it winter in the northern hemisphere because it s farther away from the sun okay so it s pointing away from the sun right do you think it s because the northern hemisphere is farther away no because it s tilted away tilted away yeah okay alright keep coming around here now keep pointing at the yellow bucket it s a little bit hard to do huh okay stop right there what season is it right now would it be spring perhaps it would be spring in the northern hemisphere what is it in the southern hemisphere fall okay so it s the opposite right okay keep coming around here alright keep pointing at the yellow bucket now what season is it in the northern hemisphere what season is it in the northern hemisphere now this group over here somebody in this group the table what is it summer summer why is it summer in the northern hemisphere because it s closer to the sun closer to the sun and it s like kind of like are we like a few hundred or thousand miles away from the sun a few hundred or a few thousand or like a few million yeah okay so in the scope of that it s hard to picture do you think that the distance between this spot and this spot is that much compared to the sunlight coming over yeah to make it that different okay so you think it s more the tilt exactly okay i m not sure in your past science classes what is it about heat energy and light energy pointed on something that makes something warmer or colder anybody have an idea depending on how direct it is because what i was thinking is like if this is the sun and can i come up come show us so if my pencil s the heat and the light it would be coming from here and it would be coming and it would hit with him this one more right and this one will be direct okay so i think what he s saying is that both the northern and southern hemisphere are still getting sun aren t they yes because we re so far away that the only which side of the earth is not getting sun right this minute this side when it s rotating it s night time but during the day is it still pretty much light in the northern and southern hemisphere yeah yeah so what he s saying is that it s more direct to the hemisphere that s tilted right toward the sun it s still getting sun and somebody over here said something about the equator the places on the equator those over there who said that say that again like states or i m not sure any locations right so like for texas as an example i m not sure if it s exactly on the equator but i know it s really close to the equator okay closer than we are yeah okay i just read somewhere that it doesn t have all of the seasons okay yeah somebody else said i think as much difference or variation yeah okay so this is summer in the northern hemisphere now we re going to cut across our orbit and save time go back over to that side and what season was that again winter what season was that again what season is it now in the northern hemisphere winter okay so which hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight now the southern hemisphere and what season is it now in the southern hemisphere summer summer okay alright because the heat s having to go around okay so let s go back for a second raul s group said it s because the tilt doesn t change but the tilt as you re going around changes the angle of the sunlight that s hitting the earth okay that s raul s group you guys still agree with that yeah okay and susan s group said it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in the summer than it is in the winter anybody want to move groups now wait does that mean more direct or well or literally closer literally closer okay anybody want to move groups okay that s okay you don t have to change alright and this group with fernando that is because the earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter alright i m going to show you something and i m going to see if it changes your mind okay do we get to eat the apples afterwards well we ll see okay alright okay so take a look up here alright this is a simulation what do i mean by a simulation you can come back and sit down with your group what do i mean by a simulation it s a photo or a video of what actually right it s not out in the universe looking back at our earth it s not from the space station or anything like that okay so take a look alright and look at what s happening with the axis it s a little bit hard to see on the screen okay did you notice how like what we tried to do it stayed pointing the same direction right let s do it one more time okay alright okay now does this look kind of like what he drew on the board at the beginning does it look like an ellipse yeah or an oval yeah okay so i wish i had a glass a clear glass we do right over there we have a clear glass that s alright we can use this okay there is one over there we can use this okay i want you and you re looking at this kind of from the side does it look like that when you re looking at the rim of this cup or the rim of this glass from the sort of the side does it look like an oval yes yeah okay let me make sure you can see that it does doesn t it when you re looking at it from that angle but look at it straight down now what does it look like a circle it looks like a perfect circle let s let a couple people experience that look at it from the side now look at it straight down with this one you re almost looking you re looking like right here okay so the glass it was right there i want you guys to try it too okay alright it might but what i want you to think about here is this is sort of what you guys probably saw in your fifth grade science books maybe even in your middle school science books we ll have to take a look at the pictures in our books you know publishers the people who print the books they don t always do things the right way for us to work and do you know that there are many hundreds and thousands of adults maybe millions of adults who think that the orbit of the earth looks like this because this is what they saw in their science books when they were kids growing up but just like the glass what happens i m going to do it again but i m going to flip it over we re looking at it from up above so look what s happening now it s a circle yeah and did you know that the earth s orbit it is slightly an oval but so slightly that it s really close to a perfect,0.0
from the top this way starting from the top woo hoo that went better can we have a ruler yeah 75 okay make sure you record it 75 what 75 cm c m what s c m stand for centimeters centimeters okay now we ve got to get the average i m gonna do the average go ahead go to your next one i m gonna check on the next group okay no you don t put 75 for all of them i m not just on that one we knew it wouldn t go any farther just put 75 for the first one second part trial two now what do we do okay go ahead tell me what you found out what did you discover about bubble wrap sand paper wax paper and just the plain ramp on the bubble wrap it didn t go because it was a bumpy surface because all the bumps because it was too bumpy and had to much friction too much friction okay and so what did you discover sean i discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower what do you mean by that higher and lower and higher can you explain that a different way to me well so what does that say about the surface increase and decrease spencer what did you discover so so it went farther on plain wrap versus the wax paper yeah okay so right now you re going to find the average right how are you gonna find the average like 32 plus plus 30 plus 41 divided by three okay you guys go ahead and do that who s going to be the calculator i am you are okay i might suggest someone else also be the calculator so you can compare your numbers and then i m gonna come back and talk to you about your results okay okay let s sit down let s see what your doing it s not going very good on the sand paper because it s just like the carpet why won t it go as far on sandpaper because it s like the carpet okay what does that tell you about friction that if it s sand paper it doesn t have a lot of contact it rubs against the rug it rubs against the tires i think it doesn t one person at a time paul because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn t have a lot of friction if it did have a lot of friction it would go faster okay so does sand paper have friction or not yes or no no no yes what is friction one person at a time it s like whoosh that s friction hm okay can you explain what is your idea stephen friction when a car rolls on carpet it s friction because it slows it down sand paper slows it down too so far what have you discovered about friction and wax paper versus sand paper wax paper let s let stephen tell me okay wax paper is kinda like it s probably gonna be like the look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far because you already recorded them it s the highest so far what does that mean it s the highest so far it s the one that has the least amount of friction it has the least amount of friction okay and how do you know that because we did the experiment and what happened it didn t go as far it didn t go as far on what okay go ahead an finish your experiment go ahead and finish on the plain ramp you have one more to do i see here okay and then we ll talk about what we should do next oh 39 that s showing you more about fourth dimension let s talk about our results talk about your results that you ve noticed sh stephen tanner i need to be able to hear this group okay we found now that our total averaged out to 85cm for our total average okay what does this tell you look at your averages what does this tell you about friction that friction slows you down like the salt slows you down on ice like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice it makes you go faster right and you know what it s doing outside right now what is it doing outside right now it s sleeting it s sleeting it s snowing and the roads are very very slick so what do you think s gonna be a great idea because i know my husband s coming home from work tonight the roads are gonna be slippery what s gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer what should the road crews do salt they can put salt and salt and sand salt and sand yes why so it didn t go at all i wonder if it was small little bubble wrap if it would work better what do you think i think if they were popped oh if they were popped i wonder if they would maybe so okay down here you have a graph that we re gonna talk about a little bit later but this is what i want you to do i want you to pretend like you re a teacher and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did what would you tell them i want you to write it on the back of here what s one thing that you ve learned today that you would teach someone and then we re gonna talk about it okay i want you to talk about it when you re done writing talk about it with each other and i ll be back in a minute okay we can share when we re done writing or we can share them as we write them so what would we tell someone i would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower what would you say i would say the rougher the surface the more friction i would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying except a little bit different i would say it depends on which kind of surface it is if it s bumpy it won t go if there s bumps and air all over on it if it s a smooth and soft surface it will probably go a lot faster so tell me what you are you still writing we all shared it okay but i want to see it in writing like i want to see something written down i said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes okay spencer what are you gonna write because i m gonna write kind of the same thing as heather is there anything your gonna change about it or add to it i m gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less and the less further it goes okay i like that i think you guys are learning a lot about this sean i see your writing something a little bit different what are you writing i m writing the smoother the surface the farther the car goes you guys are right the farther it goes because why because the friction because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go but on a smoother surface barely any what what word is she looking for she said on a smoother surface there s barely any friction and i like what you said you said a smooth surface is like ice a smooth surface is like ice right i said the bumpier the surface the more friction right but you also said something that if it was a smooth surface it s kinda like ice there s no friction to keep it from like if it s outside today if it s ice your car could go anywhere but putting sand down or the salt keeps it less friction more it has more friction okay okay go ahead and finish what what do you want i wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice oh so how would be do that i like that how would we do it when it s like an icy day or something and there s a little bit of ice somewhere we could bring the car out or something not like a real car oh okay just like a play car and try it out try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice how could we change this experiment what could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out i think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap we talked about that popped bubble wrap and what else did you say the bubble wrap could be what talk about that the bubble wrap could be what guys i need you to not come in here you can use un popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile and you probably use like a grid with the marbles instead you can like use a car okay talk about that to see if it would fall off now what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off with force and motion how does that tie in well what i mean is will it like go far if you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not like if it was on the it depends how fast it would go if it went faster would it fall off but if we re talking about friction does this have anything to do with friction oh i love that so wood carpet and ice and we could freeze ice because we have big containers,0.0
dakota didn t want to bring his because it s all broken well we can still look at it go get it honey actually hannah bring dakota s petroglyph over please yeah that s the thing with clay it breaks very easily okay all right will you still be able to tell us about it he said that it exploded please don t break it any more are you going to be able to talk about it still you can tell us what was on it okay put it down addy or it s going to break okay so you guys you did your small group was washoe and you re going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after the whole group the whole classroom okay okay so what i need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found and the four things that i want you to make sure somebody knows something about food shelter clothing and location but if you found something else you want to talk about go ahead so anybody chime in okay i think i know where they re located can you tell us south lake tahoe i know what they ate in your strong voice though they ate onions they ate wild potatoes wild carrots i think a little bit wild mustard sunflower seeds wild carrots wild potatoes wild strawberries raspberries wild gooseberries wild rosehips wild rhubarb pine nuts and they used sweet potatoes wild turnips wild spinach seeds okay do you think we re good on food yeah okay i think olivia got the part well we ll talk about that after so we have location shelter go ahead okay who s going to go next i have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes okay what do you have your information on i have clothing they used rabbit skins buckskins and plants okay and i m sorry coleman what did you say they used sticks and leaves to build their homes okay so you got those four covered any fun facts you guys found dakota what did you find out give us one fun fact in 1859 the washoe wait let dakota guys remember we re trying to be good listeners in 18 go ahead sweetie in 1859 the washoe had about 90 people times aw no no not 90 900 can i see what you wrote they had 90 000 or nine hundred nine hundred and now they only have 300 no let s see the population well i got it off the computer yeah i got 1500 in 1855 the washoe numbered about 900 but are now reduced to about a third of that number what that the same fact you had dakota yeah yeah very good thank you dakota i got in 2007 there was 1500 but i got it off the computer too and it said that well you know the computer is not always i got the latest what kind of data did you get like demographic or where did you get yours from i got it from google well guys 300 was what yours said dakota and yours said 1500 yeah are you sure yours wasn t 1500 from before and now it s 300 well it said in 2007 okay on here on my brain copy okay we might need to look at that some more you guys we ll look into that before we report on that but that would be a fun fact anyway joe did you tell us anything yeah i have another fun fact okay a fun fact their houses are called gadus gadus okay okay now who hasn t had a turn guys all of you got your hands up let s include our little friend addy okay they made baskets any good baskets mostly dot so la lee most famous one she was famous for making baskets what was she famous for olivia she was the she made the most baskets than other washoe people the other indians and why was she more famous than all the other indians i don t know that but i think she was like a really good basket maker you think she was a good can you scoot over i can yeah okay did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets yes did you know that they re in very oh you have a picture awesome these are actually dot so la lee s baskets mm hmm okay so the thing if you every get to see one of dot so la lee s baskets they re woven so tight you could carry water in them and we talked about symmetry today in math they re perfectly symmetrical yes they re woven so tight that you can put water in them and even dot so la lee had like 2000 you what she had made that many baskets she made how many a lot two thousand two hundred and something wow it would be nice to have one of those now huh yeah but they re like you can t even buy them you cannot buy them huh they re like in a museum they re in museums but i think some people do have a private collection of them really maybe one or two yeah they re not like our petroglyphs that we re going to talk about can you have a petroglyph in your private collection no those you can t have okay so you guys let s see who wants to be the writer do you have a pencil grab that pencil would you write your tribal name up here you guys are washoe and then go around addy and find out write the name of the person next to the food the shelter and that s what you re going to kind of be responsible for let s get addy and you can go around and ask each person or you can say who wants to do food w a s h o e i ll do fun facts i ll do shelter i ll do fun facts no i ll do shelter okay how are we going to decide joe should do the clothing joe should do clothing is that okay with you do you think i should tell you the name of the hold on we re not doing these we ll do that later thank you olivia olivia volunteered for food joe do you really want to do clothing i was either going to do clothing or language because i found a whole thing for everybody can do a fun fact too but i was going to do a fun facts we need somebody to do food and location okay i ll do location shelter shelter and location i got i ll get shelter good thank you coleman and then i know you guys want to do fun facts too so everybody can do a fun fact l e and then m a n c o l e m a n l e l e m a n okay now we just have location left but what s dakota doing what do you want to do how about me and dakota will do location together does that work okay that s who s going to do the fun fact everyone can do a fun fact so write thomas dakota for location no don t worry about fun facts everybody has got a fun fact right there so if both of you are doing it it s got to be super duper okay so we re going to look up if they lived in washoe they probably did did you have their names down addy it s like washoe people where are you guys going to find the information dakota and dakota d a k o t a better you guys what did we find out about google maybe you want to find two if you have two things and they don t say the same thing you might want to check another one there s a lot of maps on google there s a lot of maps on google yeah we re going to go we re going to go on maps and look where okay thanks i m going to take that so when you okay so next week or the week after you guys are going to do a whole group class presentation on your tribe and you re welcome to bring pictures or artifacts or like pieces of whatever if you want to do that you can bring a basket obviously it s not going to be a dot so la lee can i bring a arrowhead did your tribe have arrowheads yeah okay now looking in front of you you guys for our art project we did something what is this called who knows olivia i like how you raised your hand the petrograph louder petro the petrograph petroglyphs and what is a petroglyph you re going to break yours thomas addy what s a petroglyph it s a carving in a rock a carving in a rock did your tribe make petroglyphs we don t know why don t you know cuz they put things like right down they made it they just moved they just carved it in and nobody really knows unless there s someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down generation to generation yes very good what were you going to say you know when we were looking on that website we were looking on that website and one said washoe okay yes so some of them they attri they say that they did it but we don t know who did what petroglyphs but in our state can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably and maybe if they found petroglyphs where your location was you could say those were shoshone petroglyphs would that work we re washoe washoe i m sorry all right so who wants to share theirs first so what you re going to do is you re going to share it and show the whole group and tell us what yours meant to you okay okay addy you want to call on somebody since everybody is dying to talk who s going first coleman coleman can we see yours okay i want to zoom in on it hold it up a little bit because i got it up okay what does yours mean to you it means that it s night and there s some stars and there s a duck and then there s a canoe on the water and there is a lot of meat and camping camping okay anybody else want to go pass it around joseph oh don t pass it around we don t want to break it we re going to stick them on wood or something oh let me get a picture oh i m zooming in up higher joe because i ve got this on a tripod okay all right mine is we re going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top and there s a snake trying to eat the duck there s an eagle it s daytime and the skies are clear oh addy you re calling on people thank you okay addy sit back a little bit so we can see miss olivia random things but i think i know what it is it means they re hunting buffalo at night and then the daytime came and it s all rainbow and we caught some fish that s it okay good who wants to go now thomas nice so there s a camp and there s a little hill behind the camp and there s people in war and there s a snake and then one person is not in war he s just trying to shoot a duck but then the other guy shot him and then there s and this has been happening for three days okay dakota mine kind of blew up here mine kind of blew what happened to yours honey it like kind of didn t turn out so well it like blew up in pieces can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces well it was like i don t know did you have like hunting symbols or anything no he just did like squares i drew lines because i i remember i didn t really know what to write you didn t know what to write okay that s all right but if you could do it again what would you do what would it mean to you i d probably make up a war thing a war thing okay it s more war except hunt hunting oh okay did you go miss addy okay humans were hunting for humans that s what s on mine okay addy i would wait until everybody was listening thank you i can t show your okay just show the other children it s a sunny day a snake is trying to eat the fish the fish are in the river cool what s the little zigzag mountains oh those are mountains oh cool sun snake river just fishing just fishing so what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe what would have been your tribe only baskets we could have maybe tried to weave something what else basket but that wouldn t be too fun in our project like we could pretend that we were real,0.0
yeah i have a question it says how does the skip predictions move on yeah olympic athletes how does your data compare to olympic athletes how does your data compare to the class average yeah do we do the predictions it does help to have somebody look at it with you sometimes it s not as obvious as you think scott we re going to stay on task right good we re not doing predictions right no so take a look at patterns what you want to do for this question is look at patterns do you see any patterns there okay good it s not necessarily worse by the way it s definitely different it s worse skye if you re like dead if we re talking about heart rate and yours is worse so we still have a little bit to learn how that affects you if you are inactive or not so let s look at the pattern there you see that that s kind of what i was thinking you just missed that one again one of the things we can talk about then is data collection exactly come on let s go it s not the same numbers it s the same pattern right good any patterns that you guys are seeing back there yeah a little bit what might that be this is science be more specific are there any patterns for number four you guys skipped it it s okay yeah four you don t have to do predictions you compare to athletes don t do it for predictions but do it for your class data and athletes okay now that s a perfect simple question now we take that information and put it into number six hopefully you re going to make the mental jump that we need here what does heart rate have to do with homeostasis if we challenged our body with a little bit of exercise you know how heart rates work now the question is why how does that keep us alive there you go good how much more time do we need did you get this one right if you guys did then you understand the process hands down congratulations make sure you share your answers make it quick i don t want people in and out we good how about a drink here you go we got it it s good no i ve got it covered okay two more minutes remain in your seats number six there you go you re good good job scott you re very subtle and very helpful thank you remember we ve got a mic that s on there all right got two more thirty more seconds right then you re back in your own seats if you can do six you re the best ten seconds or so get in your own seats for the next ten seconds two things are going to happen we re going to start off with simple answers then we re going build upon them and then hopefully we ll get to the more creative ones at the end this class we have enough time to do that so let s do that right off the bat question one daryl can you read it or would you prefer to have somebody else read it i can read it okay good what is the hypothesis being tested okay so let s talk about it in our experiment we were looking to get something measured what is a valid hypothesis for this experiment scott we ve got and then alicia alicia let s go how does exercise affect your heart rate good now that s a step in the right direction the hypothesis has got to include the concept alicia and anybody in her group want to help her out it s got to include the concept of homeostasis so can we do that can we tale a look at our aim a look at our model hypothesis how does exercise affect heart rate that s a good start anybody else have something else different that would support our understanding of homeostasis you re yawning you okay all right let s sit up thank you little bit more good good like you re playing third base okay matt good let s sit back now there you go got it anybody else go ahead if we do exercise then our heart rate will change okay so that s kind of what alicia said go ahead it should keep going up and then when you re not it goes down again a great great hypothesis if we were at a third or fourth grade level that s something we want to do but we re not at third or fourth grade it s a tenth grade class here i want you to get out of your seventh grade minds and add this concept of regulation you want to try how does homeostasis affect your heart rate how does homeostasis affect your heart rate think about that okay you want to reword that which causes which oh how does your heart rate affect homeostasis good but now we ve got to remember we combined exercise in this kevin how does your heart rate change to meet the needs of your muscles and cells in the body you didn t use the word homeostasis but how does your heart change to meet the needs of your cells and your heart in your body excellent i don t need you to write that i just need you to understand that s the direction we re going you want to try now i had almost the same thing i put heart rate changing throughout exercise to the needs of homeostasis homeostasis now you guys are closer on it so this is about how does your body adapt itself even when stress with exercise to maintain balance to maintain homeostasis in the beginning of this unit you guys remember i had the balance board up here how many of you got on it i forget one person two people that s it three people do you remember how hard that was to do did we throw things at the people yeah was that easier or harder to stay balanced when that was happening harder no i thought it was like easier what s the room for error how easy is it for one of the sides to touch or how not easy is it it s very easy same with homeostasis that margin of error we re in a small range here if i take your temperature dustin and it s healthy not healthy okay 98 6 no but what if you re 102 what if you re that tell you you want to try so 98 6 is normal but what if somebody takes your temperature and you re at 100 degrees or it s not normal you want to give me a word for that sick you would be sick you d have a fever something would be wrong with you you would be not normal right good that s a small number 98 6 and if you have 101 you ve got to see a doctor or something you ve got to get rest you ve got to get medicine you ve got to do something to help your body heal all right number one done number two and three daryl you did a good job reading the first one richie can i ask you to read the second one sure what are the controls in the experiment okay so controls another word for controls anybody real quick independent variables no not at all constants things that don t change so above the word controls can you guys write the word constants things that stay the same so savannah good good opportunity for you to learn okay so when we say controls we re talking about the exact opposite of a variable which is a thing that changes everything stays the same or constant what are some the examples of the constants that you have in this experiment the controls go ahead the three categories the three categories we mentioned everybody in the same three categories okay go ahead the amount of time you re giving us and how much time was that do you remember two minutes two minutes two minutes two minutes the amount of time was the same the temperature temperature in the stairway good because if you were going to talk about your own temperature actually that changes again that s a whole other topic about homeostasis that when we exercise we start sweating right so you re talking about the temperature in the exact place okay anybody else go ahead where we exercise and then the height of the stairs like if one stair was higher than the other then it would be harder right all the steps are the same now here s a control one kid said in my last class and the other kids disagreed with him he said the exercise was the control that we all did the same thing no do you remember what we did we walked the stairs did we all walk the stairs the same way no well some of you kids hustled right like two minutes you were like bunnies like gerbils on the stairway you were just going crazy others were just walking and it was okay good let s move on three independent and dependent variables that would be helpful thank you for your hand up we only need one answer of the two and somebody else will give the other one so dependent or independent whatever you want heart rate is the dependent variable upstairs okay one second one second so tell me a little bit more though daryl is it heart rate and how do we measure the heart rate take a look at your graph your dependent variable is going to be very well described on your graph help me out go ahead okay you re looking at it somebody want to help him out what is the dependent variable of this he s close but he s not close enough to be right savannah number of heart beats per minute per minute you had to have the per minute on that okay that s the standard that we use in science independent variable kelsey would you like to try i m not sure i know it okay that s okay what did we introduce in this experiment to affect our heart rate to see if we could stay balanced exercise bingo so your independent variable exercise exercise two minutes of exercise is what we did very good your back group you have another one or it s all up here okay four how does your data compare to the olympic athletes how does your personal data compare to the class now remember we re scientists so you just can t say it went up and then it went down or whatever you can say that but it s got to be justified with some sort of specific numbers richie had his hand up first okay justine okay go ahead my heart rate predictions were very low because i didn t have any idea and then my actual heart rate was higher than the olympic athletes because they re used to running a lot okay here s a good example of what i m talking about first of all what you did with predictions is great we didn t actually have to even do that one for this question but that s great richie when you say they were higher what do you mean your resting rate was higher your post exercise rate was higher your recovery rate was higher all of them okay you ve got to include them in your answer you have to include that in your answer you ve got to be specific go ahead matt margaret you re next okay yeah go ahead my prediction i had low numbers but after doing the experiment only one of my numbers was lower than the olympic athletes okay so again what was that one number post exercise post exercise was lower wow that s rare by the way did you see the class data compared to you then we weren t supposed to do the prediction but i m getting so many hits here how many of you to a look at your prediction compared to other people quite a few people you guys when you were doing this you asked me what s the normal range and i didn t tell you i wonder what you would say your prediction is after i gave you a range i purposely didn t just to let you see just like you said mine was off because i didn t know any better good all right five super important question here oh i m so sorry does anyone else want to contribute to the olympic athletes i m so sorry go ahead my actual heart rate was higher than the olympic athletes but for the exercise one it was only seven heart beats lower okay so what does that mean to you how close to an olympic athlete are you is what i m asking i guess it could be exercise like with the olympic athletes i know it wouldn t be like anything for them for me to be like that far off is kind of like impressive right and how would you know that didn t you say you had like a cousin who does crew does crew at the olympic level or just does crew she does crew at an olympic level wow a premiere athlete then fantastic what s crew crew is when you row a shell or row a boat there s singles doubles and quads oh yeah fantastic anybody else before we move on christina and then scott i noticed that we re just like like i realized we re all like the same because when the olympic athletes went up class average went up and ours went up so i noticed it was the same pattern just like depending on what we were doing it was different than the olympics and all that stuff that s the big picture i want everybody to see here take a look at your graphs one more time do you agree with what christina just said forget about your prediction number did you see that there s a pattern here no matter who you are as an individual in this class or as a class average or as olympic athletes when we exposed our body to exercise what happened in all cases it went up so we would say it increased okay what happened when we rested post exercise yes it decreased it decreased right so there is a general pattern excellent job christina go ahead scott make it quick i had the same thing as her okay good all right key question if we can answer six we ve got this lesson down pat when muscles are active cells use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate and produce waste chemicals and heat more rapidly what does heart rate how does heart rate demonstrate regulation homeostasis in the body i ve got three hands up i didn t see the order i m sorry so i m going to go four or five hands up i got one maybe two i don t know gabby three go ahead richie if someone leaves something out it s yours when you re exercising like you re using more nutrients and oxygen so the blood has to carry more nutrients at a faster rate so your muscles get it it does that to maintain homeostasis so it s like using it constantly okay daryl she did a good job i m going to change the question for you what if your body didn t do that what if you re running up and down the stairs daryl and your heart rate didn t increase it would have a hard time maintaining homeostasis okay excellent and what would happen what do you think you d be dehydrated and wouldn t sweat or anything well i don t know if you d be dehydrated you wouldn t get as much oxygen because it wouldn t be working as fast and you wouldn t be like so it might get stuck in there while you re running up and down,0.0
welcome to our kindergarten classroom the library is the heart of our room where books are labeled and sorted by genre and reading level to facilitate student self selection this is also where we display author studies current student work and student made literacy charts this is where we have our writing center more level texts classroom volunteer supplies and a lending library math work is on display and student portfolios are organized and easily accessible we have a few tables to facilitate guided instruction and small group learning our schedule and calendar are housed in this part of the room and we have a message board which is portable and used for modeled and interactive reading and writing our learning center s chart organizes student movement around the classroom and our word wall houses high frequency words and rich tier 2 vocabulary words but on the morning of the fair the little calf was nowhere to be found she had wandered down to mud pond by the cornfield to cool off when she waded into the muddy water her feet sank with every step she sank deeper and deeper and deeper the little calf was stuck in mud pond get the hands get the helpers the farmer shouted when he saw her all the farm hands came running with their ropes but the more they tugged the more stuck the calf got get the big yellow tractor the farmer shouted he can save her but the big tractor just scared the little calf she sank deeper and deeper and nearby farmers began to gather around readers i think we ve come to our problem in the story i think the characters otis and the calf have a big problem talk to your partner and see if you can figure out what the problem is readers i heard a lot of good ideas i heard a lot of good discussion miami what s the problem who sank into the mud the baby cow it s called a calf oh my goodness readers i heard everybody s discussions you guys were all talking about the big problem the calf is stuck in the mud help me write that in the problem box here we go the calf is stuck in the mud that s our problem the calf is stuck in the mud let s see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story let s see how they re feeling now it tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions call fire chief douglas and the fire truck the farmer shouted they can save our little calf but the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper the farmer was fit to be tied if the farm hands and the big tractor and even fire chief douglas and his fire truck couldn t save the little calf who could oh my goodness look at everybody what effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community how is everybody feeling i like amir s raised hand how is everybody feeling amir they feel sad sad i heard you say another good word that started with w worried worried they re sad they re worried how else are they feeling sad worried scared scared scary what if they can t get her out scary call a lot of people yeah they re in panic mode they re trying to call everyone they re panicked frightened afraid afraid worried worried so so worried so so worried they might call the other tractor the big tractor can t get her out he already tried wait kanye were you talking about the other tractor the red one oh they might call otis maybe otis could help that might be a good solution to the problem let s see what they do let s find out suddenly the little calf s ears perked up over the hum of the growling crowd there came a faint sound in the distance a soft rhythmic purr put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck the crowd turned and looked you hear the word chuck who is coming otis otis good let s see what happens the sound became louder put put puttity chuck put put puttity chuck let s all make otis sound put put puttity chuck put put put chuck put put puttity chuck all at once otis put puffed from around the barn he turned and he headed straight for mud pond otis put puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters edge the calf heard her friend s puttering purr and bawled it was almost like hello she s crying out to otis yeah she bawled to the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd otis slowly began to circle the pond he circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned never taking her eye off her friend it looks like they might be solving their problem with each ring otis made around mud pond the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own the two friends had found each other again it looks like we found a solution to our problem talk to your partner about how they found a solution how did they solve their problem i heard a lot of good discussion how did they solve their problem you guys i heard everybody talking about it so jabrielle how did they solve their problem what was the solution who came and got her out of the mud i heard you tell isaiah otis otis ramaya how did otis get her out of the mud just like jabrielle said he rided around the mud oh i don t know if you can hear ramaya she said otis rode around mud pond and got the calf out of the mud help me write that otis rode around mud pond it was called mud pond otis rode around mud pond and he got the calf out of the mud that s the solution now how is everybody feeling what effect is this having how do they feel now that they have their problem solved nijyah excited excited miami happy sherod glad glad edward yeah they re feeling great they re reunited their family is back together zion how do you feel when you solve your problem they are a little exhausted aren t they that was a lot of work ismail they re feeling okay they re feeling relieved relieved wow great job let s see how the story ends readers you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story it s really helping us comprehend the story better we re understanding it really well otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went following them into town it looked like a happy parade no one needed a fancy no one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf otis was a special tractor and the two of them were special friends from that day on the farmer discovered that with otis puttering purr beside the chicken coop his chickens laid more eggs at milking time with otis gentle chuck nearby his cow produced more milk and on occasion otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields but often at the end of the day otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved,0.0
scientist number two i want to know what your question is what is your variable that you re isolating and what are you measuring you guys ready okay so table two or table one our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes even after they ve been rinsed and our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used and the dependent variable is how they changed from before when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them cool and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain tomorrow we also were planning on taking pictures from before and after so we could like compare those so you may want to do a scale like marley did with the intensity of her hair dye as well okay but get it set up today make it really controlled with all your measurements and just change the type of oil alright scientists do you have any our experiment is we re going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges okay using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water i don t know i read your document i don t know what the positively charged particles you are but did you work it out okay so what s your question then our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum okay does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls them coming together scum balls okay good table three what s your question um how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water like using what we re going to use mainly olive oil and toilet paper okay perfect and testing the independent variable is testing how long we re going to stir how long it takes to make scum and then our dependent variable we re going to take the observations of time okay so the question is how long does it take to form scum balls independent variable is the stir time and the dependent variable is the how long it takes how long it takes to do it uh huh what are you going to measure though we re going to actually try to measure the surface area of the cool so you re going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time okay that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot okay table four what s your question how does temperature affect the oil and water how does temperature affect the oil and water awesome and we re trying to figure out how it will separate how can you separate it what are you changing in the experiment we re changing we re going to use regular temperature and put it on a bunsen burner and put it in the freezer cool and you re more than welcome to use the freezer in the back good idea alright table five what s your question does heat affect the scum ball does heat affect the scum ball and our independent s going to be amount of scum and the amount of water and the dependent s going to be heat okay so your independent now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever so your independent is really going to be temperature so i feel like you have two independent variables why don t you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate is it the amount of water and the amount of scum or is it temperature okay we were going to change the temperature then keep the amount of water and the scum constant because you can t do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures it means you re testing for two different things while you could do that it s two experiments and we don t have time today so just one experiment alright table six so our central question is is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes okay and our independent variable was the amount of oil and the dependent was the shape okay so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes independent variable is the amount of oil or scum dependent variable is the shapes while i m over here i just want to draw your attention to the back of the room that is the waste beaker which has scum on top of it right now it s every kind of oil that copper used yesterday so if you want pre made scum i encourage you to use copper s waste from yesterday so the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water but the top portion of it is just that less dense oily scum okay alright table seven what s your question it s can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter okay so we re trying two different types of oil and we re going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container okay and you may need to use two of the same identical filters so just make sure you re really consistent with your measurements between those two filters good alright i m excited about their project because copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting so check back in with this group later on if you want to see what s going on with the filters and table eight what s your central question does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water does oil collect the most what does oil collect the most of each thing oh the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water okay so you re going to look and see what it attracts and what are some of the materials you re going to use dirt sand and pebbles dirt sand and pebbles awesome so your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract how are you going to measure those results mass mass okay cool you may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass if you get too big it won t measure on our balances which brings me to my next topic which is safety talk conservation of materials did you guys get a lecture yet no because sam is too busy with her why don t you go over there and see what they re doing go talk to her thank you alright lady scientists what s going on we re like i thought that we didn t need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn t have enough time so we just did the small amount and then the larger amount okay now that we did the middle speed we re actually seeing a lot different stuff because the balls are actually coming together that underneath and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top okay and this is thicker than that one okay let me get another group over here because they re also trying to form a scum ball and i d like them to see your results terrence and catherine and maddy can you guys pause and come and check out this group s experiment i don t see scum it makes me mad ooh this is so cool why does it look like that i want it to look like that come on over these guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls can you guys talk about what s your independent variable what are you changing we re just changing the different speeds okay and yasmine what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three the dirt oil and the water okay and they used the black potting soil dirt is it the peat moss in the plastic bag that s peat moss okay good and taylor it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom what s that don t know can you guys fill her in toilet paper toilet paper which makes sense because there s a lot of toilet paper over there okay and so far your results have been they ve just done the high speed and the low speed right and they re like oh it s the same nothing happened nothing happened right they came back today and this is the medium speed and what s going on a lot of dirt balls are actually coming down and forming together because they were all little pieces of dirt and now they re making big globs of dirt and that s weird so does time sitting overnight have anything to do with it that s what we talked about with these two actually this one because and this one too because we didn t see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one and then this one i just noticed that it s actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil okay are the highs and the lows working the speeds yet have you tried to re run the highs and the lows today no re run the highs and lows you have a good seven six minutes see if they start to form clump balls not sure if you can use this one can i go get a funnel sure there s one on the table i am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not if you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything or you could leave it how it is it s your choice got about seven minutes okay thank you yes cool hey you guys have some diesel fuel on your table any information research observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome the three of you all together alright so we got 97 no 47 94 for all of them okay let me put the camera on you four ready let s talk about it is that okay okay so you isolated your variable different types of oil you made everything the same same size same amount of water same amount of soap time soaking everything was super controlled right okay and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board yeah it was 47 94 like it jumped between them two numbers constantly none of them like consistent so it was consistent alright so any initial conclusions yes i said that since all the things were like a darker color and the oils were kind of close i guess in like how they felt and what color they were i guess that maybe if we used a white shirt maybe there would ve been a difference because it would ve soiled it more do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric yes yes okay alright let me hear your conclusions and then i m going to this one that had water on it is different looking than this one like the material looks more like like dry or something right so there s some qualitative difference i know that this one needs to be flipped over because then it s the same side of the fabric okay so water that one s whiter lighter okay so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking and your control this one is darker your control was the same as all of them the 47 94 okay and you any conclusions yet um i don t know i kind of think the sand thing is sand because i know the one we put on the paper like it went all the way down to 40 something so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was okay and lauren what was your central question my central question the central question of your experiment oh it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there how much of it was still there okay or if it would affect the fabrics differently okay but your light probe is saying no they re all the same so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever should i take that as data i think you should take it as data yeah and it s okay you addressed your question which was how does oil affect it different among shirts in your case with the soap maybe not at all differently i d like you to try one more thing involving paper towels and what you re going to do is you re going to see you re going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there s any oil that s absorbed on the paper towels okay so that can be one other way to take data to see if there s still any oil still stuck in the shirts okay okay goggles on goggles on goggles on what s the highest temperature we could put it at are you guys boiling you can put it all the way up you just have to be really cautious get your hot hands out the big glove alright heather s group i m coming over to you guys ready okay what s going on over here we put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt okay ooh salt when i was a waitress we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out maybe you could put a second wait that s kind of like clay i was going to say flour because that s what we do if i spill what do you notice it s starting to kind of clump when we had the clay it was really really clumpy but then it it the uh yeah like the clay just clumped and then we had to get before and that didn t really make a difference it just sat at the bottom my hands are sticky oh thank you while you re here do you remember the charge of the particles of clay positive or negative negative okay so negatively charged particles and now you ve added sodium chloride which dissolves in water you ve got an a plus positive cl minus negative and you re clearly getting a scum ball no what happens when you turn it off it just all settles at the top when we put clay in there for the first time it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top but nothing of the magnitude so that motion really helps it to stay together yeah that s what we did we put it at 500 rpms first and then we dialed it back down to 100 let s apply this to the water treatment plant was there motion at the water treatment plant yes was there clay in the water probably from where from the sediment on the bottom of the schuylkill from the sediment on the river now remember the stuff that s going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home so it hasn t had a chance to go in the schuylkill river yet okay would there be any clay in the homes not in the homes no not in the homes not in anything flushed down the toilet yeah so yeah there could be some like clay like sediment sand particles going through or at the very least we could say that there s probably some negatively charged particles going through some kind of silicates shall we throw away the fabric sure who knows what s in feces right alright so what i think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form have you talked about cece s experiment yet no go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed also matt ian s sorry catherine s station is using sand specifically and i forget what the other material is it looks like peat moss and they re having no success so go ahead and do a little quick walk around and clean up motion can you let them give them a 10 second overview yeah and then go taylor pull it together you ll be okay you re good okay did you get any scum no we didn t we just got into lumps the fastest way we got a layer and then everything the soil settled on the bottom and then for the middle speed it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in clean up clean up,0.0
you re going to test and be coming up here for materials okay go you just follow the lines if no if the lines if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper the termites will follow the lines we should draw like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow and we ll make it like this well it s not going to be on a circle it can be like this and see if they ll follow that circle yeah would that be a good may i bother you with this i m just covering them up what are you saying yeah well beside this one if termites we ll place on a red piece on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines then the termites will follow the lines in the circle okay so you re going to use the color red line again what color paper would you use white white paper yeah and i think since we ve already used colored paper i think that s a result of that well again you could do yours and yours and tie them together use different colored papers so what s the point of your test that depending on the colored paper we ll determine what the termites sight can do i would think it s the color of the line because that s what they re following so you think they re following the color of the line yes yeah but when they went to the end of the white paper they went to the black and they came right back well no that s because they knew what it was that s because i like kept hitting them back okay so you re kind of going along with the idea of color how could you prove that color was that color effects their you draw a bunch of different circles draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size but of different colors and see which one they go to i like that nice okay on a white piece of paper yeah again i ve got colored paper the more tests you do the more accurate your results would be all right so let s do the same test but on two different types of paper so if termites are placed on a white piece of paper put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out no that down good and there you go so what were we thinking about testing um putting tables in line using different color and to see if we re not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around oh very nice yeah because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down they followed it down tricky okay they went it s true so they didn t follow this part yeah because it curves no because they we drew the circle they go like then they curve and go down and they came here and went back up they all followed hmm interesting thank you four you ve got about two more about a minute and a half actually what are we thinking i m going to go ahead and cover these up we were planning on doing um like we think they re attracted to the ink and i m going to test it with like a marker a pen and a crayon okay to see if like if they follow the ink better than the other ones nice would you use the same color of ink yeah because it would be the control there you go very nice um what color paper are you going to use should we use regular white i would say white yeah all right good okay sounds good where are your termites stop playing with them and we re going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out what were you guys thinking about testing mainly if they are going to follow the red line then they must be attracted to red they must be attracted to what red red okay so how could you test that they are just attracted to red we re going to make two large circles two large circles and some other lines and some other lines but what are you testing again if they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red okay so you re talking about the color red um would you use so you tell me what you re going to set up i m trying to follow probably just a black one and a red one lines or circles circles circles okay all right yeah basically just for fun okay okay just for fun all right um you should be collecting materials if pens and things aren t working let me know dude get the line what happened to your situations well we put tape over this and now it doesn t follow it over here i think they like the color red none of them are following any of these lines how could you continue to test that they like the color red put more red over here i mean we also put the tape there and it doesn t like the tape it gets confused and we have the red paper and it didn t follow the black lines or the pencil yeah that s what i mean none of them here are even doing anything they get tired and just start standing there twitching do you need some new ones no there are still pretty lively yeah so what are some of the conclusions that you re thinking oh terrance be sweet ah be sweet ah white on red they only like that also they only follow that type of pen they don t follow any other type of pen or pencil um they don t necessarily have an affiliation to red okay how do you know that cause they walked off the red paper okay they walked off the red paper so you threw that one out how could you continue to say that they like that particular pen and not having to do red we tried black pen we haven t tried another color on white yet see look it stopped at the tape it s confused at the tape no neal what i asked you is that a pen or a marker it s a pen it s a pen oh he s following the other we drew it on the other side we drew a circle on the other side it looked like he was following it is it something inside of them no like what the ink s made out of how could you test that using the red pen on this okay taking two different pens go grab some more that s a good idea red color pen red color pencil you killed the ant gentlemen be nice to your termites oh oh wait wait here neal let s get all right group here s a red pen colored pencil oh look that one s alive okay now then so what are you saying is going on they re still following the red one yeah they re still following the red pen so it s not necessarily an affiliation to the color red so it is something inside the ink so how can you test if it s something inside the ink i just got the other colored pencil take another red pen go grab some it s right there that s a pencil it s the color red look stick with the no you just threw out the idea that it s red stick with the color stick with the pen idea we need a pen like this no i think we have the exact same pen no no the blue one like this they have a blue one like that go see there s blue pens up there hey can we borrow a red pen i meant blue you know what i meant bam it s a different type of pen it s all right different type of pen but it s blue now did you get a blue one no i just got red ones i got bundles nice now they re going to follow it now i thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen i think it s that pen i ve got the same pen they re still the red i think they are okay try that one there s a hole there by the way if you press through it it will break go are you going to make it intercept the line yeah i m going to oh look he s following the little one maybe it likes circles wait wait i still think it s something inside the ink draw a square see if it follows a square so that would be able you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square so draw a square see what happens yeah draw a square i ve got another black pen i have all these pens why not draw the square inside of there inscribe the square in the circle terms terminology you re a professor now oh it s following it it is the pen curves are easier it didn t know where the line was okay five four um we drew different lines in the different types of pens markers colored pencils did you do it all on the same page or on different pages on different colored pages why would you do it on different colored pages ah to make sure the tests varied okay did you use the same color of ink on each page describe to me your experiment web the whole group can chime in too um like we drew like a black circle on a black sheet of paper okay to see if they could only like please don t be rude black circle on a black sheet of paper keep going what else and that didn t work they could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that christian came up with that take a white piece of paper and we drew like every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles none of the other colors what were the blue and the red circles drawn with i believe different types of stuff mainly pen though and this was all on one sheet of paper well we tried it on different sheets too okay that s what started us off okay um did you have it all on one sheet at first yeah okay what did you realize was wrong with that they were pretty much getting confused as in we re going to have issues with what maintaining a control a control good only one independent variable nice um nick s group how did you go through the indentation we drew several circles using each of the utensils and then i think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of if they weren t in the middle sort of eating off of the wood or like just exploring around they were following the pen okay um your indentation line did you draw that with just pens different types of pens did you draw it with markers did you draw it with a paper clip we just used the same color but we used different things like we used pens vis a vis colored pencils stuff like that okay and what was your conclusion with that they followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation because they came the termites into that line because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop and i figured oh well they must be blind because they can t see that there s a drop there interesting point why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation instead of a pen because it wouldn t have shown a color but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen okay so any components within that pen color chemicals type of pen whatever if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation you would have been able to do what pen verses paper clip pen would have looked i think it would have looked the paper clip would have looked deeper but the thing is like would it prove if you had it or not had what or not if they followed the dent or not not just like the color or the like smell or whatever very good very good so by using the paper clip to create the indentation they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent maybe the scent from the pen the chemical from the pen that left the indent by doing the paper clip just by itself we would have been able to say okay that obviously doesn t leave any chemicals it doesn t leave any color and if they re following that indentation we know that that s what they are drawn too okay carly your group had an interesting set up um we well we kind of did two all right but the first one we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with like white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper and that didn t really work so we did the other one and um with like the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper and they only went on the red pen one okay what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described as in something that might have thrown off the results paper i don t know well notice in one of the experiments you used a what to create the circle the pen okay you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what paper but you used a oh white yeah you used a white colored pencil so by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil what are those two things now added on what variables added on variables okay for one you re using pen and pencil another you re using colors so how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables gentlemen calm down we could have used colored pencils the whole time okay could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time good um what group haven t i talked to matthew explain to us the set up of your group do you want to start i don t know what to say oh okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it so we decided maybe it s not color so we took a black pen a big one um we took a black pen and then two red pens of different type and two blue pens of different type and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue it was the bic pens so we decided there must be something in that in the chemical structure of that ink that s you know similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort um and the termites followed it okay um did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday yeah after school that was extracurricular all right so but we figured out the bic pens we figured that out okay good excellent set up there were there any variables that when i was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens you got this yeah we were drawing with different shapes cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing so we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it and they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape it might be in the pen or the color they don t really like sharp angles though we drew a square and they got lost yeah they couldn t find the angle okay interesting so um if any of you did do any sort of research you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit and we learned that those were what pheromones enzymes enzymes not enzymes what are pheromones having to do with we just spent three days on it animal behavior animal behavior communication their chemical signals okay so we learned that termites emit these pheromones we might have encountered this last time and that s the same thing why ants follow a specific trail um when honeybees sense danger they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out that danger s coming but the pheromone that termite s emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen in bic and papermate pens actually mimics the chemical in the pheromones which is why they followed certain pens,0.0
um that one substance there s no other types of substances laced into the main substance okay and what is yours a substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it okay so i hear three different things here okay i hear pure means one substance not mixed with anything else i hear pure is something that s not altered or manipulated in any way and then i hear something s that natural i want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions so do you agree with those three definitions or not and tell me why and tell them why well i don t think it s natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures um like trees so what and you re saying a tree is a mixture because why because it like has different colors and different like feels to it oh so different colors and different feels so like different textures is that what you re saying and why does that mean that it s a mixture cause it s not all the same how do you know i don t know i don t what do you guys think do you agree with her that a tree is something that s natural but it s a mixture so and that was your definition that you got natural i would say it s natural like some things are natural some things aren t natural i guess cause think about like when a diamond forms it s a natural thing and it s only that substance sure i agree with you with that example a diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure but for your definition what i want you guys to think about is a definition that s true all of the time so for a tree i want us to use that example about a tree really quick cause you re saying it s a mixture right so you re saying it s a mixture cause you have different colors and different textures why is that statement different colors an indication that it s a mixture well it s like it okay and a difference between substances what is color an example of michelle characteristic properties characteristic property which we know what about characteristic properties it is characteristic to that one substance it s characteristic to that one substance okay so would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about yes okay so what i want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper okay hey you guys i know you re discussing it and i hope that you re kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions here s what i m going to have you do based on your conversations it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper that your whole group agrees on i ll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we re all on the same page or not okay we already had one discussion where we had three different definitions my guess is when i read what they write down they re now going to have an agreement on what a definition is but i may be wrong so let s see write your definition as soon as you have it done hold it up in the air pure substance same thing pure or pure substance okay so what do you want to do what was your definition my definition well huh what did you write literally first time the first time yeah the first time what did you write initially i wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like clean it s not dirty or anything good and then what did you change it to a pure substance is a substance that has not been touched okay and why did you change your definition to that like what made you did it happen because you guys talked about it yeah okay so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to something that hasn t been touched he said like a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the earth okay so you said it s something that naturally comes from the earth so is that what you mean by not been touched yeah so it s just natural and not manipulated by people yeah so it could have been literally touched but unprocessed unprocessed okay so give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists um tree okay so tell my why you think a tree is pure it hasn t been really been really processed or anything it s in the forest okay so then what do you know about color of substances um sometimes it s a characteristic property it is a characteristic property right which means each substance has it s a certain color and for that substance it will always be that color when you think of a tree do you see one color or do you see multiple colors sometimes multiple multiple colors so what is that evidence of multiple colors characteristic property it is a characteristic property but i mean how is having hey brett can you please focus on what you need to be doing do you have your definition done yes okay here s what i would like the rest of you guys to do including brett s group you now if you have your definition written down i want you to go ahead and start doing number two give me your examples of pure substances and give me your explanations i m going to give five minutes for that that means 10 38 so a tree has multiple colors green is going to be an indication of of what would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance not really no okay why not because leaves or grass bark is a tree okay so you re saying that more than there s more than one substance maybe that can be green okay but okay so that s fine if there are different colors of green do you think that means different substances no what about characteristic properties though what do you know about a characteristic property it never changes for a substance it never changes for a substance so if i have two different greens do you think i have two different substances no i would cause that s the definition of a characteristic property right one green would be characteristic for that one substance always never ever something different if i see a different color that must mean i have a different substance okay if i have two substances together do you think that s a mixture or pure mixture mixture so a tree do you see multiple colors on a tree yeah what does that indicate a mixture a mixture of multiple substances is a tree natural yeah yeah so does that affect your definition for pure if you re saying it s a mixture it can t be pure but it s natural so maybe our definition needs adjustment so think about what you might change your definition to be now okay okay and write one down are you done with this problem it s anonymous okay well then water isn t is it oh interesting so you guys you don t know if water is or isn t you explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and something else okay so let s okay well what s the chemical formula for water h two o h two o so what elements are combined to make water hydrogen and oxygen okay so i agree with you there hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together which makes water okay so do you think water is pure or a mixture well when they do the water definition we were trying to decide like if something s straight like we could some not a mixture okay then is it pure okay i m going to read your definition really quick okay so a pure substance is a raw substance nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature there is no trace of any other substance it is not a mixture okay i see two definitions in there here s what i see i see a definition that talks about it being i see three one your definition is something that comes from nature another one i see is something that has not been changed another one i see is no trace of another substance so that sounds like one substance okay those are the three definitions i see but is there a substance from nature that hasn t been changed no water is a substance from nature that hasn t been changed i mean yeah we add things to it it hasn t been changed but it is a mixture is it a mixture though yeah but what about when like animal live in it and stuff does it change so you re kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way if it gets in contact with something else yeah if they re even from nature so here s what today we should be able to figure out by the end of the period and you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure here is my hint my hint to you is the way we can tell by looking at something if it s pure or a mixture cause you can or maybe not just by looking but experimenting with it it s based on characteristic properties of matter that s what i want you to think about so it s just the primary colors then what do you mean primary colors well the primary colors i don t know it s just that color so is color a characteristic property of matter yes what does that mean then wait but can t you change it when something s a color but when you add one color to something like if i add a color to the water doesn t it change the water when you add a color into water it mixes with the water so it s not still water it still tastes like water i didn t say that i just said it was mixed it s a mixture oh okay i didn t say that either but if you put the food coloring in it so and why are you saying that s all of a sudden a mixture because they re so different substances together okay so what then does pure mean not mixed a substance by itself a substance by itself so you believe water is just a substance okay alright alright you guys these crutches are going to kill me are you okay those hurt you re hurt okay you re okay we re going to talk about it right now okay do i have everybody s piece of paper are you done okay this is not true really yes alright turn here and stop what you re doing listen to what what i want i know that you may not be done with your examples yet because you re still struggling with your definition of pure i want to show you what other groups are thinking so i m going to show you all these i ll ready them for you too so that you re going to see that we have differences and the idea is by the end of today based on what we do you should be able to change and finalize your definition okay and competently be able to give me examples alright so the first one and i ll try to move this let s make sure you can see this if it s hard to see tim will you turn off actually why don t you go ahead and do that now tim i think it will be better i don t know but just the front set of lights thank you we ll come down okay the first definition an unprocessed material which is one substance by itself instead of combining multiple substances to get the material i see two different definitions i see one pure means to be unprocessed and then i see another one substance by itself okay here s another one a pure substance is only one substance that is not a mixture so you re starting to see that pure and mixture which i will agree with are basically opposites of one another so you ve got to explain the difference between them so a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture so i m wondering what your definition of mixture is who wrote does anyone who wrote this one are you willing to share do you have a definition for mixture then um well multiple substances that are mixed together good so you re saying so great your definition for pure is one substance while mixture would be more than one substance okay this one says a substance that has no mixture involved so you re saying that there s a clear difference between the two i still don t quite see a definition for the word pure yet in this definition a pure substance is a substance with no other substances mixed in it is one single substance so i m starting to see a little bit of a trend a pure substance is a raw substance nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature there s no trace of any other substance it is not a mixture so we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different but i see three definitions one it s something that is raw or something that and i think this is what this is saying correct me if i m wrong but you mean by raw kind of in some way connected to natural okay so something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other so i kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple okay as a definition okay maybe i only saw two okay oh i thought this one was typed i was like how did that happen how did was that you is that your handwriting that s insane okay i like it it s like prefect woah okay there you go alright a pure substance is a substance or material that hasn t been mixed with any other substance it is only one substance okay um two two more a substance is only one substance and it is not mixed with any other substance right and our last one oh this one s actually different a pure substance is an element okay that s a different definition than the other things i ve heard they are made up of one atom they are not mixed with other substances nor do they contain other substances within them so i hear two definitions in here one being pure means that it s just an element and then i see another one that it s a single substance okay so i want to hear some of the examples you re coming up with right now and i m not going to say if they re right or wrong i m just going to try to probe you with some questions okay naud what is one of your examples salt okay so you say salt is pure why do you say salt is pure because we don t think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt so you re saying that to be pure means one thing one thing in that container and you re saying if it s just salt that must be pure mm hmm okay miriam it has to be raw and like like plain like raw salt like not like mixed with preservatives or okay so literally just salt that s it yea okay alright so let s take another example or if you disagree with them you can also offer up your argument for that shaina what do you think well we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance why well i think a diamond can only be cut by itself and can only be cut with a different diamond ok so that s really dense so we thought that if anything was added to it something else would be able to cut it and that would be something else that was less dense so interesting what is um you re talking about density what is density it s a characteristic property a characteristic property so this is good you definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter okay that is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is hannah a property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance yeah a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount so what i m hearing you say is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density and you re saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond it must mean that the densities are the same and so since the density is the same for the whole diamond that means it s one substance,0.0
i m not gonna have no peace with that if you feel something i don t know something like done bothered me that done made me like brought me down to the point where i was crying about it the first thing he say i ain t gonna tell nobody but i feel where you coming from he tell me it shouldn t get to that point where you mad over something that doesn t matter if it s good or not that seriously don t matter that s in the past the past ain t gonna do nothing the past can t hurt you okay alright that s what i d tell him so really this kind of conversation should ve been held with what kind of friend a pretty good friend a pretty good friend or maybe even your best friend nope not your best friend oh yes my best friend you already know who i m talking about he s my best friend now he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad i ask him man why you doing this i thought you was different from everybody else but not once have i actually went out there and played the cards while i m at home how i m not gonna tell nobody and then come two days later everybody and their momma walking up to him and asking him questions uh why you did this to her so let me ask you this so your saying you ve had conversations with your best friend before and then he s divulged information that you ve said to him no from time to time he might get mad and he ll say something then we have to have that one on one talk ok this was between me and you i don t want to hear this coming out nobody else s mouth cause then i know point blank that you done said something let me ask you this if you would have that conversation with someone is he truly your best friend is that a conversation that jay chime in any time if you got to keep reminding him that hey man if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else honestly are they really your best friend no like i said before that s another acquaintance because you can t trust him like that man he telling you he ain t gonna tell nobody but he going back on his word he going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat that s why i said it s about you johnny no between what you say i don t blame johnny if he s truly your best friend he won t tell nobody he won t tell anybody but then you got like it s a boundary between stuff you tell you can tell your best best friend something deep but it s a certain boundary between that which you wouldn t tell him certain stuff i tell my best friend almost everything but certain stuff he don t need to know right cause certain things we my business don t need to be his he have one of those days when he feeling down then i come over there blah blah blah don t say nothing to me then he flips out on me and he wanna tell something that s so deep to me that i m sitting there looking like did he really just say this cause your shocked you re in shock and you don t never expect well anybody wouldn t expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that s not meant to be told me i would never expect chris to say anything i tell him so far he has been a best friend he don t tell nothing i say i don t want to have to tell what he tells me because we got that best friend relationship cause a best friend should be loyal all the way to the end not when it s necessary or needed that s right not when it s necessary but at all times right yes ma am okay alright let me go to the next scenario you decide you would like to take in a movie but you choose not to go alone you finally reach someone by phone who is just as bored as you and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant you both enjoy yourselves so much you plan to do this again where is that person at on the grading scale i d say that s a group thing because they interested in the same thing that you re interested in group friend okay alright group friend group friend someone that you know through association now in this scenario it s just you and that person and it could be someone that you met through the group or it could be it s not necessarily your best friend you just started hanging out out of the blue you met them and when your friends not around y all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then i d say that s a pretty good friend pretty good friend i could say a pretty good friend cause i would hang out with a pretty good friend a pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y all enjoy yeah because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group kind of like we re together because once again you know that person through association of someone else but a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say okay you want to go out yeah you wanna go out let s go it s nothing between you guys if its a girl you understand that she just want to see the movie and i want to see the movie we laugh we joke we go out eat pizza together but it s nothing else there we ain t trying to be boyfriend girlfriend you can t try to make it more then what it is right then if it s just a friend one of your dudes that you hang out with y all like the same movie like i you know you can t call me cause we re not on the same level i m your teacher at all times even though you know i like the same type movies you like and we always discuss the same type of movie we re not going to go to the movies together cause you on the adult level we on the young people level right and we re different types of our friendship scale is different is not even up here it s right okay now someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum you were glad to hear it because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway so your parents tell you both that you can go and you can the exhibit is in a different city your parents tell you both that you can go and you can spend the night over out of town what kind of friend is that is that just an acquaintance that would probably be with like with my best friend i wouldn t go out of town with somebody that s not by best friend i ain t going to go out of town i got to go with somebody that i know is going to speak to me you know what i m saying mm hmm got to be somebody i can trust i don t have to many friends i can trust i don t know why but all my friends is just the reason why i don t get too close to them i can t exactly tell you why i just don t because i can t trust everybody okay alright because you ll never know who will be your best friend today and they might turn on you tomorrow so you ll never know okay so that s why this is a good piece to do because we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance who is someone we that we will just see on the hall hi how you doing bye got to figure out who is the acquaintance and then we got to figure out who is the group friend who is a good friend who is the best friend because there s somewhere there s a fine line like you guys said there s a fine line between all five of them but you got to know the line you got to know where the line is drawn you got to know the conversations to have with all of them because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend that you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall right right cause there like you just telling me your whole business but you don t really know my name or nothing about me that s something the stuff you telling me i wouldn t tell you i would tell it to my best friend but as far as what s going on in my house i ll probably let you know i got sisters and brothers the basic stuff but not oh my momma s strung out or doing this and that cause everybody s business is not your business your business is not are you that s right we always got to keep that in mind because so many times i ll get calls from parents and they ll say so and so just talking too much especially when people are getting into a lot of issues or getting into confusion at school or what have you and a lot of that comes from the fact that they don t know when to be quiet or they don t know what to say or how to say it or who to approach because if someone says to you stand up for a minute in the morning when you first come in and the first thing i say to you is what good morning good morning good morning vincent how you doing good morning ms jenson how was your weekend i went to my cousin house i got to spend time with my godmother and i went grocery shopping okay so that now you told me i didn t say what did you do oh i said how was your weekend it was good it was good and that s basics of that conversation it should not be oh guess what my momma my momma and her boyfriend was fighting and they threw the cat out the window and then the police came over because at that moment you have just did what stepped out of bounds you ve stepped out of bounds you ve divulged way too much too much you done opened the book before it could be read or you done read the book before it could be bought because really i didn t buy into all of that i didn t want all of that you just wanted to know your name and how was your weekend i just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend and then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper but you not asking for that you just asking for the simple that s right that s right jeremy i m going to ask you stand up for a minute jay cause you re a pretty secretive guy mmhm so normally we got to pull stuff out of you cause i said to you earlier i said your dad called and what was that about i was stuck on the river and he said i was stuck on the river my first thought was jeremy got a boat so i said you got a boat that s what i said right yeah i was over there at the wafflehouse over there by brian gates behind over there at the apartments i went to see someone and so he went to see someone but again sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation and when to divulge it and when to divulge it because even though he went to see someone he didn t give me no elaborate details yeah this honey she was because a lot of times you don t need that i don t need that you just wanted to know where i was at just wanted to know where you was at i want to make sure you was okay make sure that your dad got in touch with someone to be able to say jeremy s okay okay alright alright yeah you can have a seat that was a good conversation huh this was a good conversation this was a good conversation you thought this was a good lesson today was a good day it was a good day because some people don t know their boundaries of talking and telling it all some people just give up too much information some people around here got to even say what did to you and everything from here we re going actually the next thing we re going to discuss is conversations that s where we re going to go from here i wanted us to because the other day we kind of looked at friendship but i wanted to go a little deeper because i know i want us to realize that friendships they should be reciprocal not always and when i say reciprocal everybody understands what i m saying the same no should be the same like how i feel about you you should feel that same way about me i feel like you trustworthy but you feel like i m going to tell on you any chance i get right exactly but they re not always reciprocal but keep in mind that friendships are always changing because who you put down on your friendship scale on thursday it change it changed you gave me a whole different not a whole different set but you gave me some different people and you actually moved some people where you had yolanda as a good friend she became just a group friend four days later okay and you had valid reasons and keep in mind that things do change just because someone was a best friend last week don t mean they going to stay your best friend they re not nine times out of 10 i promise you guys when i was in high school i could there were three there was four of us and i considered them my very best friends now i don t know how deep they would ve had my back but i considered them my good friends we talked on the phone we shared secrets we shared stuff you know when we was sneaking and doing stuff we shared those things but today i really can t tell you where they re at now there was some friends that i met in college that we re still friends to this day they re friends that i ve had since i came into teaching that i don t know where those people are because i ve been teaching when you think of teaching for 18 years people have friends people have come and gone in the teaching profession but i haven t kept in touch with all of them because there has to be a there has to be something in common that s going to keep you friends it can t just be i see if i see them just at school and that s all we ever talk about is school and schoolwork and complain and fussing and about lesson plans and stuff then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates those are just acquaintances people that i pass in the hall we laugh we joke but we don t share any intimate conversation okay i m glad this was a good exercise for you guys and next time we re going to look into conversations the type of conversations you have with each one of those type people,0.0
we all know it s splash just put it next to it your turn okay let s see how are we doing how many animals do we have do you have a few we think mussel it can be in the middle it can be in the high tide and the low tide because it can move around and then it eats clams and clams would be in the high tide it can grab on to the wave it eats clams it says this eats clams i saw the of the mussels sort of in the mid high tide one day when you were out at the tides before yeah excellent so you re using some of your previous experience to help you good excellent okay i ll be right back it s a snail the shell protects its soft part as a hermit crab grows it moves into a new shell it may take an empty shell or steal one from another so it s like war i think that would be in the high yeah that s a high yeah i think the high tide i thought it would be in the mid or low but no well it could move down there what s your next one tuesday put this circle right on top of the clock same time same height wow that s pretty interesting isn t it good for you oh you re looking at your first one what s your first one yeah just line it right there on the clock that s eight yep like eight yeah excellent and margo you re getting your first measurement negative one oh awesome monday s negative one hello kazhu i will show you where you need to go it s negative something i don t know what negative it s right here look here did you find out they went that low yeah mine went to negative six wow i didn t put tuesday and then i m going to put a block under it you had one that went really low look at that awesome you set that up first pretty well didn t you look s like we got monday and tuesdays getting done wednesdays are being worked on perfect so much to hear what it is you guys are gonna discover from the charts let s do a worm whatever that says they have a veil of flaps on each side the worms usually stay buried in the sand if a wave comes it swims back down toward the sand and wiggles into it i m pretty sure that s low yeah no how about maybe high high tide high tide no but the waves crash there a lot actually splash there s more of the sand yeah i think it would be splash want to try splash on that one good and you guys thought that because what did it say it said it buries in the sand and if a wave crashes it has to wriggle back down okay so it stays in sand as much as it can how many does nate have oh two the whelk that s a scientific name that s a tough one isn t it ah it s hard it s hard it s okay you can skip it just say look for the whelk on rocky beaches on rocky beaches and on rocks sift or muddy gravel beaches the shell of the snail can reach about two inches in height it is a scavenger feeding on kin it also preys on injured animals such as limpets the snail has also so i thought the sentence said it also preys on injured animals such as limpets so preys on them what does that mean i think i know what do you think andrew it means catch them and eat them it catches them and eats them where do you think that would need to be if it s gonna eat limpets i think it would be in the high tide oh you ve got both of them so you also might want to talk to addy and find out what addy has and try to figure out where those guys are before you place your whelk no so addy what do you think what is one of yours let s find out what yours are right under each shell i think it s already in the high tide zone i thought it would be in the splash wait no high high high yeah high tide okay the limpet guys i thought it would be in the splash no remember you gotta like figure okay i ll let you two go i thought it would be splash because no i don t think that the thing should be underwater most of the time it says watch for whelks on rocky beaches and muddy or gravel beaches it could be in the middle true yeah mid okay mid no you have to say where the other food is i put it to high splash okay you go then you go guys look too much heart one that was lower than negative four and this is negative four what do we have margo did you finish your graph excellent how are you doing on yours joshua you finished i m on friday you re on friday so maybe you two should start setting up your circle pick your question margo joshua and this is your question and set up your circle right on there grab your graph and a chair and sit in your circle off to the side there i think it s either low or splash no not splash not splash otherwise there wouldn t be anything lower mid i d think low no no remember at the aquarium they were underwater completely no things sticking out only some of the spine yeah but the rest it was just boom there i am doing it i m doing the sand dollar for my report and it s high no remember at the aquarium also it was at the bottom of the tank remember no it was at mid i remember i checked and also anyways i m doing the sand dollar okay okay so margo do you have your question with you so everybody gets a chance to converse and talk about the answers to that question or maybe you might realize something or come to a realization about your information and all of you can contribute to the answer okay so go ahead were there any patterns you noticed doing your graph what are they i noticed that first it went to medium then it went lower and then it went higher and higher the third fourth and fifth time my pattern was that each time each level started getting higher and higher and higher and so it s really high mine would go to 12 to 12 then it would go to 11 and then it went down to 10 and then it went down to nine it went lower and lower and it was kinda like a mix monday and tuesday were the same and then it started going higher and higher and higher all the way what was unexpected i ll go first it went lower than the average on the chart it went lower and then it started going higher and higher i thought it was just gonna stay in the negative parts but it actually went up to the nine in mine i expected it to be some different levels but it kept going higher and higher and higher and then when it started to go even higher it just kind of stayed the same mine went higher and higher and higher and higher again okay who s next i am unless you want to go read your question what was your highest tide what was your lowest one my highest was tuesday and friday they were both negative one and friday and thursday they were both negatives everything was negative everything was negative on yours wow negative even one below the negatives you have five negative negative five yeah that s right because you re grabbing you don t realize you ll get a negative five that tide s really low very low tide level yeah margo has her hand up go ahead margo on the day that was highest was friday it went all the way up to nine and my lowest was monday and tuesday because they re both negative one oh and my lowest was thursday thursday and it was 9 thursday and it was nine yeah and maia what was your lowest tide my lowest was monday it was about at eight and then it starts going higher and my highest was at 12 so i m wondering now if we look at all of our charts all of our graphs who had the highest tide of everybody who had the highest so you had a 12 i had two twelves no she had 11 so it looks like maybe callen and maia have close to each having a 12 i have the lowest score i have the lowest i think joshua got the lowest with a negative five reading on his anybody else have a negative five no i have a negative one but no negative fives okay alright so whose question s next alright i ll be right back,0.0
i think we need the policeman because he s the only one with a weapon he s the only one with a weapon though what if he goes crazy he s the only one with a gun exactly that s a good thing though wait a sec why is that a good thing are you saying he d shoot us i didn t say it s a good thing if someone could shoot us no i didn t say that you said it s a good thing explain why you think it s a good thing it s a good thing because we could stock the food drake ok so he said two things but he might shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us we could take him he wouldn t shoot us where you at riley it looks like you re sweating i m trying to think between you two so you write down what you said you d do and you worry about everybody here who do you think is the most important eileen says the policeman does everybody agree with that or not yeah why because if someone gets hurt he can respond to medical stuff yeah they re first responders it s a good idea anybody else can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody would anybody that you know that works here already that s good he s too old his life would be long so the old sir will be able to be productive to society think about that anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about in support of communism do you want that in your society or not no why not because okay so freedoms are important to you mr malls yes ma am send kyle to the office for a minute please he s in miss crane s room right now what core are y all in because i told mr wayward where he was supposed to be and he said he was with you uh he we re actually in 2nd he s with miss crane all right thank you ok you can resume folks we re about i don t know hey why should we keep the male professor what s the issue you have ok now this is just a question guys if someone s not fit does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society nah they could be really smart ok they could be really smart but she s nine she s nine she s nine so are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run we re talking about the long run the long run so you got time so just consider all aspects just because maybe just because she has does she have anything to offer let the group decide it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it if you want a male farmer say aye aye if you want the male professional say aye aye if you want the female scientist say aye aye if you want the male preacher say aye aye definitely female nurse we already have a nurse we already have a nurse who cares i do in case he dies but the female med student s only in second year she hasn t even been to the hospital it might go for four years exactly we got the scientist and the nurse to help her plus she d be off breeding excuse me no offence you know we only got like thirty minutes we only have fifteen so hey we re about 5 or 10 more minutes and then i m gonna stop you in groups and you ll listen if you have not managed to already make your decisions here s the key point here s the key point still got a group talking you need to listen about five or ten more minutes you need to come down to your five you need to have the reasons why you chose the five and we re gonna share those and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn t choose keep in mind edna keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that s gonna hopefully flourish and i hope you re all taking people with uh that you know will make it but there s also you gotta keep in mind there s five people you re leaving behind that most likely is not gonna make it but you you re concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society ok ok start closing up in the next five or ten minutes about who you re choosing who you re not choosing those radiation levels are getting high very high over here especially i know really i kinda changed my mind about that because she s cute you can t change times and down i m agreeing with that say aye again if you want aye finally they wanna take cripple girl and i m saying he s still overruled i posed this question just a minute ago so this is so we can look at mass so we can look at it two ways one you re looking at she can t do anything she s gonna be hard to keep because someone will have to do it second way of looking at it she and she doesn t have her doctor uh is that true once she had a doctor ok and then what else have you ever heard anything about yup so what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a it didn t say that but again you re not saying that she is you can combine that ok continue on you need to start choosing maybe 3 or 4 of your 5 and why you re gonna take or why you re not gonna take em ok male professor too old he s too old five minutes i m giving you five minutes start making decisions but why do we need a policeman if we got a lot of money hey i wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about and one person said well she has the potential to become any of these things here she has the potential to be any of those so it might something to consider we need extra little kids and she won t help us with no extra little kids somebody s ready to go just about so you need to make sure you get your five choices,0.0
okay guys i see we ll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication okay so can you read the objective with me please so i i will be able to do fraction multiplication okay i ve also put it in spanish just in case that helps you okay so the first thing i want to discuss with you today is what do you think about that do you agree or disagree and then why so one half does one half equal one half why or why not and then give me some examples okay raul it s becuase it is one half they re the same okay abraham it s like you cut a pear in half it s gonna be in equal parts okay so you guys are saying it s equal yes okay what do you think eddie believes he thinks the same thing taleah what do you think i think it s the same you think it s the same does everyone think it s the same i do until you think why wouldn t it be the same okay so jose is saying why wouldn t they be the same okay so one thing jose says is he s trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn t be the same joe it s not the same because no that s just the board point is there a times nope it s just one over two equals one over two i was thinking it was a half times a half okay so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it s the same right yeah so now how do you explain to me why you think it s the same why you think it s the same joe because they have equal parts okay equal parts what do you mean by equal parts they have the same fraction okay jose they re both practically the same thing what do you mean by practically the same thing that once you cut a square in half you have equal parts and they re gonna be the same thing okay who is someone we haven t heard from madeline what do you think so i heard you say they are the same right yeah so why do you think they are the same cause they re both equal parts and the same cause half equals a half okay antonio what do you think think it s the same so sounds like we re all thinking it s the same okay abraham what do you think i think they equal the same thing equals the same thing okay so now let s take a look at maybe cause it sounds like we re all on the same path here so let s take a look at something else are they really the same is that half of a cookie cookie half of a cookie half a pizza are they the same no yes one at a time cause i m hearing a lot of good stuff but you guys are all saying it at the same time okay miguel they re the same cause if they weren t the same is just half so i m hearing they re the same but one s bigger than the other one cause one s a pizza and one s a cookie yeah tina you re kind of shaking your head what do you think about that i think they re both the same cause they re still one half they are just different size victoria what do you think same or not the same same cause it s still half okay so let me ask you this i m hearing a couple things and it s kind of contradicting itself meaning you re saying one thing but you re also saying the opposite like i heard it s the same because it s one half but it s different because it s different sizes different sizes you just told me it s the same but now you re telling me it s different sizes they are both fattening oh cookies and pizza are both fattening okay felice why i think they re still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it s big or small because it s still chopped in half okay so if a half of a half so would you rather have half of 10 or half of 100 half of a 100 why because it s bigger because it s bigger but i thought it was the same no no cause it s the same thing it s still half but you re commenting half of a hundred it has to be the same thing like the pizza a whole pizza and you cut it in half okay you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen for it to be half for it to be half but here it s not the same thing you re saying to me that it is equal so which is it so now you re saying you don t think they re the same no you get more pieces than a cookie they re still the same they re still half okay so who still agrees that the one half equals one half raise your hand okay alright now who says that one half maybe sometimes doesn t equal one half okay so we got a couple alright so delphina what s your thinking i haven t heard from you what s your thinking i think it depends on what you are looking at so in case you didn t hear her delphina said it depends okay hear what she said it depends on what you re looking at cause she said with the money example that you guys well all of you unanimously chose half of a hundred that s 50 as opposed to 5 half of 10 so it does matter so now we just go back to the question does one half equal one half okay raul i think one half equals one half i think it s still the same it s not talking about how big it is it s just talking about a half but it didn t say in the question what it was i think the question is supposed to say what it was to say if it s the same or not okay so what dallas is saying what dallas is saying that it needs to tell you what one half is cause she s saying here the previous question just had the number one over two one over two equal alright here she s saying well all of a sudden yeah the numbers are gone but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie so now it s not the same but it s the same question what dallas is saying in the question it should tell you what is it it s actually like 10 fives five tenths and and one half so what do you think what s your final thought as far as one half equals one half what s your final thought they re still the same it s a half it s still the same because it s half okay it s the same and different it s the same and different miguel and they tell you it s different okay so good question good question i like the look of that yes if they are are they the same they re the same it s one half or something one is bigger than the other one okay rodrigo what about you bud what s your thoughts on this i m still thinking you re still thinking or are you still will you compete i m still basically undecided okay you think they re basically the same so you added that basically why don t you just put they re the same why did you put basically because one s bigger than the other it will obviously still be different where we re going with this is you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is your whole unit okay alright so that s why sometimes you have to be careful what it s asking you to do okay let s go on to the next one okay so what does one half look like to you so just think right now in your head when you think of one half okay what do you see half a dollar half of a dollar half a fifty half a fifty half a gallon of juice half a gallon of juice half a body half of a body half of a cake half of a cake okay guadalupe what do you see half a paper half a paper okay so let me take it to the next step so what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice does it make sense no does it make sense no it doesn t make sense so we have to make sure that we know what you have to make sense well it makes sense but how is it gonna make sense it s what if they re the same if they re the same but what s the same the object the object or the whole unit right like what is it we re talking about we talking about pizza we talking about cookies paper paper juice people people eggs alright so the other thing i wanna talk to you about is does multiplication always make things larger bigger yes no so i heard yes yes yes and then no so now then what cause sometimes it makes it smaller if you do nine times one it s gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero it makes it zero jessie did you hear her example no okay so what she said was cause it s important i want you to make sure you understood she said that no because nine times one is nine then when you go nine times zero it s zero so it actually made it less right what do you think though when you multiply in general when you multiply does it make things larger when you multiply two things together yes okay abraham it gets bigger because like six times two it s 12 and it gets bigger okay raul what do you think raul v when you multiply does it always get bigger it depends on the number what it depends on the number it depends on the number so give me an example zero times 8100 is gonna be zero okay so can we so i m hearing kind of like a lot of you are saying yes it makes it larger but there s still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always like if we go back to if we go back to that one half if we go back to that one half and that dollar gino what s 100 times one half times one half is a hundred and a half a hundred and a half 50 50 i got 150 150 taylor do you agree one hundred times one half is 150 raul b 500 five hundred how d you get five hundred i thought it was half of a thousand a hundred though no more thousand one hundred one hundred times one half is it 110 half of 10 is five half of 10 is five so what is your answer the one hundred times one half five hundred five hundred okay so one hundred times one half is five hundred tina we don t know because we don t know what one half equals okay so tina s saying now you don t know what the one half is what if we re just talking about numbers one hundred times one half what would that be one hundred times one half let s say it s money a hundred dollars times one half it could be five or 50 if we re talking about 100 then it s gonna be one half of 100 is 35 okay so 45 there was a lot of people talking so you couldn t hear but louis is saying it depends but if you re talking about money if it was hundred dollars times one half it d be half of 100 which is 50 let s take that example one hundred times one half is 50 so then when we multiply that did it get larger no yeah it got smaller didn t it you start with a hundred and you multiply and you got 50 which is less so what do you think now do you think it always makes things bigger no sometimes it makes it smaller so let s can you give me another example then that s just make sure we prove it is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then like five times four five times four we start with five times four you get what 20 it s a bigger number okay so that s if you multiply it times a half right ten times one half ten times one half would be five raise your hand if you think it doesn t always make it bigger it depends on what you multiply it by alright very good so we re gonna use the area model to show one half times one half that s a whole one half times one half abraham says it s a whole but let s go ahead and let s take a look i m gonna go ahead and shade in one half okay and then we ll take a look to see what it actually equals here s a half there s a half how many squares are shaded both colors one two one out of how many total four one fourth so one half times one half is one fourth is one fourth smaller than one half yes that s another proof that when you multiply it doesn t always get bigger you could make it into money like one fourth is 25 cents alright very good a hundred divided by so let s take a look at another example if we re to use an area models for this what would that look like three fourth it d be one half right we d see one half times one fourth so what do you think half of a fourth one eighth half of a fourth which is one eighth he said one half of one fourth is one eighth do you agree yeah okay,0.0
okay so tell us a little background about ed alright well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious okay so because of his complaining of chest pains be subtle from conscious or no he called and he talked to the paramedics but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well how do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition generally it can clog your arteries what can clog your arteries the fat that builds up okay from being obese yeah okay is that one of the i guess physical signs that someone may have a heart condition yes okay okay alright go ahead it is also his blood pressure it said it s at variable levels so that means his heart isn t working properly or consistently so that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system it could damage it it s also another sign of a heart attack okay so the variable heart or actually the variable blood pressure and some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research you were wondering what did this variable mean and i think what you said is exactly right it s not normal okay they state the variable meaning it wasn t working how it should okay so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history so tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let s say you ranked who was your number hmm who was your second who proceeded him nelson nelson so you got ed ranked over nelson where some other people had nelson ranked number one so what do you think well he s unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately and since his heart attacks aren t his title he needs it i think it s important to see to get treatment to get medical care yeah okay if he doesn t get treatment what do you think could happen probably he ll die from the heart attack if he doesn t get treatment or paralyzed what do you mean by paralysis why do you think he could become paralyzed i m not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not okay you re not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis yeah anybody like to comment on that question go ahead jordan it s a stroke it has a brain clot and then that will cause partial i can t say it paralysis yeah that word but heart attack you could have a heart attack after that using different parts not paralysis good point so jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis what system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis what system in our body is that nervous system yeah nervous system okay understand doban jake got that alright so you guys have ed you ranked him number one and then you ranked nelson number two along with quite a few other people it looks like we have some consistencies there let s look at group b you had nelson ranked number one but then you did have ed ranked number three so you didn t think ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to nelson and or monique well nelson and monique had the most critical vital signs they seemed the most the worst because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic so they were not and they were dehydrated too when your body starts to dehydrate that s not it really messes up all your systems so they were what systems cardiovascular system the respiratory system the immune system everything s just being attacked here because with eve let me see this his heart rate was way below normal and that s the cardiovascular system his temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon what s the normal body temperature for that of a human the normal temperature is 98 6 and he s at 109 he s at 109 folks okay i think this was one of our hypers if you remember nelson and monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital okay so he s at 109 isn t this like the immune system mmhmm yeah so that s the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down it s at 10 respirations per minute 10 respirations per minute and the normal s like 20 so he s down to half so i think that his vital signs were way more out of whack did you count in on the blood pressure the blood pressure it s really low and that means his circulatory system s not working right which means blood s not getting everywhere it needs to be which means he could end up having i don t actually know if it would lead to a stroke but like if everything s not getting blood everywhere his brain might not get enough blood he could have brain damage or something like that it s interesting she said stroke talking about nelson was nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms seizures it was seizures he was having seizures is that is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system absolutely think about all the systems you just named what s going on with nelson cardiac nervous circulatory immune dehydration entire bringing in dehydration digestive not enough water this guy is having a rough time isn t he so if you re pretty confident in why you ranked him number one yeah okay comments anybody well the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because monique yeah because she has a better chance of survival so you ranked him three and it s interesting you said we thought he was going to die he was maybe beyond that point of help yeah okay so why d you rank him three why not rank him seven well what if he has a shot he s got a chance yeah okay he has a chance over mark that wound to the chest yeah because mark got shot in the chest didn t he you d save him though it s interesting you said if he has a shot mark s the one that got shot he was more stable than nelson was though mark was mark was more stable yeah interesting you re bringing in the whole fact of now you re triaging it you re saying okay mark s a little bit more stable even though he s got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot we don t know what kind of gun it was but i feel like if you rank him a three he s at such a critical position that it s either you rank him one because he needs treatment right away or he s going to die okay so you re saying he s got to be one based upon all the symptoms based upon his vital signs the condition that he was brought in if you re not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die is that what you re saying or early on like you can t wait too long i guess you ve got to rank him one to three otherwise so he s like what group were you we re f you re f so you had him okay you had him at a two yeah okay alright so you re saying he s a top three yeah especially you had a hand up oh i was just agreeing with him if we thought we had any chance we should be like let s not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven okay good point brian well were were thinking speak up a little bit please well we were thinking that even though he s unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient but compared to like the other ones like albert or mark his symptoms weren t that of like great danger as the others and even though his body temperature was 109 that could have been because he was going through heat stroke but now that he s in asprins they re a cool environment you bring up heatstroke why do you think he s going through a heatstroke well i don t know because he was unconscious and they said he was dehydrated and everything well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like i also figured it d be heatstroke because his daughter monique yeah i m sorry monique it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as nelson was then it s more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she s going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it s most likely that he is too because they re both in the same environment very interesting i want to come back to this point ryan you ve got your hand up what were you going to say i was just going to say that monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke you re exactly right now my mind instantly goes somewhere here jordan your hand was up first i was just going to say that since their temperature s so high they re probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels so just putting them they re going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment or really cool compared to where they were if they ll put them into more shock which can also be fatal which means they re not exactly just because they re in a hospital doesn t mean they re necessarily going to get better right away okay obviously they need some treatment you don t want to go from one extreme to the other but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit yeah they need to get cooled down and what else do they need water water lots of water correct yes you can t really say that monique s symptoms can apply for albert too because monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting so that s probably what most of the symptoms are from we forgot about the bee sting it says she s dizzy nauseousness has cracked lips is having difficulty breathing has a rash on her legs and stomach okay she got stung by a bee like you were saying the reason we put monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee it shows here that with the difficulty breathing the bee sting her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or epipen getting what epipen you know what it is just say epipen epipen yeah epinephrine epinephrine yes it should elevate them in the largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like respiratory system is closing off she loses her breathing possibly absolutely she s having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here here s where my thought went and i said we d come back to this point maybe sean you were going to comment or somebody else they re both out in the wilderness this canyon they re both having heatstroke symptoms actually monique got stung by the bee she s having separate issues there you don t see anything else different about these two individuals sean one got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top do you think that would have a difference in their physical one gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what third of the way excellent point you know what s the other issue between these two jack you know well like they re both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke but monique got stung by a bee and at the same time nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms so it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off interesting interesting yes would it be their age age excellent look at the difference in their age how old s monique 18 yeah she s 18 nelson the dad right he s 51 i m not saying 51 is old but there s a big difference between 18 and 51 plus the fact you add in what sean said he s got to hike out of this canyon he s going to try to find help right is he having to expend a lot more energy yeah and he s got to go uphill he s go to go uphill yeah it s hot he s got no water he s got to go uphill he s losing basically control of his body no energy no water erin and that s why we had nelson as number one and then monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem but nelson was having it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything and monique she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee so it wasn t like so we put her close up to the top because there was she s already been waiting for long enough she needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon so they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they d been struggling long enough absolutely what during our discussion we were kind of using speak up a little bit sorry okay so during when we were discussing the age we were thinking also monique but which group were you real quick e you were e okay so like what we thought was that since monique is 18 years old verses nelson is a 51 year old well like it makes sense that monique has a stronger immune system because she s more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas nelson could be different but we don t know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure it doesn t show but i m just saying in general we were writing specific about his other health because i wrote that down age related diseases age related diseases yeah so we re missing some medical history yeah so it s possible there because he s older and because his immune system isn t as strong as monique s is we have to like or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter s absolutely as doctors medical history is so important it s so important in the triage process and we ve been through this folks you know you go to the doctor s office you go into the hospital you know in addition to while they re taking your vital signs what are they asking what are they asking when you go in medical history oswell have you had any previous stuff what s stuff mean like surgery so like problems okay other medical conditions yeah okay what s another question they ask very simple has it ever happened before has it happened before is it hereditary could it be hereditary what s your family s history and i think that s what brian you were relating to back there what are you here for today okay let s look back in the chart should i at this moment when he comes into the hospital he s obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped oh so you re asking about you re referring to nelson yeah because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon but because it s so low i would guess that he doesn t have a history of high blood pressure okay you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it blood pressure is obviously low i think we addressed this a second ago why do you think it s low sarah because everything else that s going on it s also affecting blood pressure yeah i think i truly believe with the limited amount of information we have i truly believe that because of the dehydration the heatstroke the no energy no nutrients i literally think this entire body all the systems shutting down shutting down i really do think that but it s a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure s 85 over 50 does anybody has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before okay 85 over 50 that s low i mean that gets to borderline point where you know you re dizzy i mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system it s not high enough i mean that gets borderline with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up i think his body s just shutting down and you bring up a good point but i think in this case just with everything else going on i think his body s just shutting down okay honestly on the side of that besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help during the scenario that he s in high blood pressure like with it s problems that it could cause with it s possible weakens the heart could have actually killed him during the long extended time of trying to get to the paramedics that was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people that this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without and plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there s no possible low levels that could even cause problems true yeah blythe like on the graphs i feel like there s nelson his blood pressure and the blood pressure of elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas nelson was 85 over 50 but we just talked about how like nelson s blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be but with elder he has a head injury and,0.0
yes i think if it s really really quiet and you want to talk about something then go ahead but if a lot of people obviously want to talk probably a good idea to raise our hands okay what else be involved be involved yes i will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion because everybody has an opinion but i need you to express that opinion what else don t criticize other peoples ideas don t criticize other peoples ideas okay what might you do instead suggest something give your outlook give your opinion okay give your argument but don t insult the other person s ideas this is a safe place to share ideas okay now we re going to have three jobs i m going to need a task master a reader and a time keeper time keeper you want to be the time keeper alright you need to let us know when we ve got about two minutes left of the class i want to be the task master okay so what does the task master do they make sure that everybody s on task yeah what else what might that look like subjects get off or out of control so people get off subject we could a little bit of crowd control what about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands you get to pick on one yeah task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk okay yes is there a praiser actually that s a good idea let s have a praiser i want to be him you want to be the praiser alright michael is the praiser what s the praiser do oh can i do that dang it always you can team up with me can we this class yeah you guys want to be a team okay so what is a praiser what are you guys going to do give compliments okay give compliments compliment their ideas their expressions okay and then i need a reader preferably somebody on that side of the room i don t know how to read i m unavailable you ll read no who would like to read about five seconds before i call on someone i ll do it okay so the questions are all up here there s five of them you re going to read them so the whole group can hear okay okay alright so task master oh i m here okay you re on task now and we re going to start by having the reader read us the first question okay should people own ideas i don t really think so i think it should be shared like for public opinion like public knowledge like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet great thought thanks you re doing good well i think that the information should be shared but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it i think that if you come up with an idea shouldn t you have some like you have conferences everybody gets together and talks about stuff so why don t you have scientists and stuff that like created this idea come together and have a conference and talk about it so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff and then the people that made that contributed to it have like a patent i guess you would say or just like copy or not copyright it like discovered by or yeah like that good opinion so coming together would be easier then sometimes i feel like if if no one gets credited or gets yeah they won t want to like they won t want to put the information out there yeah put the information out there like they won t have something to you know work for work for there you go yeah because i think that everybody like wants a part of getting like because you want that credit because you put all that effort into it so why not get a little bit of credit that makes it worth it how do you like that one okay second question should people own genes no yes well you kind of already own your own genes i mean you kind of they re your own like any unless you clone yourself i mean nobody else has the exact same stuff you could let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene the breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video which is actually a lack thereof of a particular part of a gene that is patented by a particular company which means they found it they spent money to find it so they own the patent on it if you are a person you don t have to be female just to look for this but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it that s what it means to own a gene i think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money that can be like oh i m going to put a patent on that so boo ya can t take it yeah i don t think that s right i mean if someone they should like put it open to the public because i mean if it s a gene like say breast cancer they should t just keep that private and make they pay for it yeah so it s sort of like owning a part of a human if you own a gene by a corporation it s like owning a part of the person who has that gene or doesn t have that gene so it s sort of a moral issue would you want to be owned by a company just that little tiny part of your dna i wouldn t excellent point you would good job jenna i wouldn t oh okay you practically just went against everything we just said anybody else have any input i agree with jen okay third question would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer yeah no i would not well it depends on what age i m at because like then you have that whole impending like doom your whole entire life like oh i m eventually going to get cancer might as well just die that s why i die but if you do know then you have the chance to actually deal with it you re going to have to deal with it anyway yeah but if you knew you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life you would know you would live life to the fullest i would i would live life to the fullest if i knew that i actually had this cancer i would know and i would do the best i could to live my life without settling yeah so the shadow of you that eventually and that would just push me forward considering drive yourself whatever i do yeah and maybe just maybe if i knew i would work to try to cure it myself so then i would be helping other people as well i would want to know remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions please feel free to share i think my what s it called my opinion i d want to know so that if you didn t know and you have kids you could be passing it on to them and wouldn t that hurt you to see that to have your kids have cancer like i would think that and then if like i did i would want to know i would like jen said live life to my fullest and because some things like if i was per se white i would go tanning wouldn t that hurt your cancer because like radiat well that s what causes it you know what i mean i d just do things differently if i had it remember what they said in the video it s often a maybe it s not a you will have this it s a maybe there are things that they can check for that they can say definitely you will or will not get like huntington s disease which is a very devastating disease remember how they talked about tay sachs which kills very early huntington s is somewhat similar but it kills later in life and starts to show signs mid 30 s and usually death is somewhere in the 40 s or 50 s so that s significantly earlier since life expectancy is in the 70 s in this country so would you want to know yes or no if you had something like huntington s which is definitely a yes or no but what about in a situation that s a maybe i don t want to know if it s a maybe because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not i would still want to know yeah because what if your body starts shutting down like one night and you just start twitching in your sleep wouldn t you want to know that s from cancer rather than your brain s messed up and drugs or something i don t know yeah i think i d want to know i mean like instead of just not knowing what s causing all this stuff happening in your body some think it s because i m a very curious person i d want to know what s going on i would want to know because like jenna said like one night you re just having a seizure or something you could take like medicine like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have rather than just like trying to deal with it and like that you could die because you never even knew what was happening so i d like want to have that back up plan with me so just to clarify we re talking about an offense end rather than a defense team so rather than waiting until you have it and reacting taking preventative measures ahead of time like an inhaler for asthma some people have to take their inhaler every single day twice a day morning and the afternoon but there s other people who don t have it as severe or a higher risk not as high as a risk who only take it when they re having an asthma attack so what you re saying is having like the pill every day constantly i would still want to take that chance so you would you want to take the pill yeah if you know you have cancer early enough can t you get rid of it can t they get rid of it if it s like yes the earlier you know the better chance you have yeah that s why i would want to know i don t think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer that doesn t mean you re going to die from it like you could get hit by a car today and nobody could tell you that nobody could predict that so i don t think i wouldn t want to know like if i was going to if i have cancer or anything i don t know i don t think it s you don t know that that cancer s going to yeah and then i m just going to be in fear all my life like thinking like oh i m going to die from that when that s not necessarily like the you know exact thing that you re going to die from like it s not a guarantee so very good yeah it s because of that great job it s because of that maybe that maybe like you might be like how that guy on the video said you have a 99 of getting a heart disorder you might be that one percent that doesn t get it and you spend your whole life preparing spending all this money on preventative measures and getting all these pills setting up stuff and then you go through your whole entire life and you don t even get it that s true that he does have a point but then wouldn t you want to take those precautions because you d be happy that you did but then you spent all that extra stuff but what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it no i mean you don t like you don t get all the stuff just in case and you don t take it s like you don t even take the medicine it s only for like when you have like travis said if you have a seizure you can take that it stops it well that s kind of just like getting hit by a car exactly preventative measures is like looking to see if there s cars and if you don t look i mean you could get run over you could not but then you also like what if you lived in fear of getting that taking all these precautions is kind of wasting your life trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen that s why people should at the right age when you have the right maturity decide whether you want to know or not and not have it mapped out when you re born whether you re going to die or not or by what in the movie how they just like took that thing right that would be freaky as a woman like you just went all throughout nine months of that and now you get to find out that your child s going to die in it s kind of freaky that actually brings us to our next question okay what genes would you want to know your children had why and how would that change you as a parent i wouldn t want to know at all i mean that s part of giving like human birth the surprise i guess it s a gamble you can t always like create the perfect human being well if you could find out what genes they were going to have could you fix them like how that person got rid of the forehead thing right now no but that is a direction we re heading in you can right now completely sequence your child s genome if you have the money and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that that s messed up i don t care what my child would look like i don t really care but i just don t like you could prevent it from having these like life threatening diseases like cancer or huntington s or like parkinson s disease alzheimer s but then again that s a way of like too like i would want to know life threatening diseases but not because like you can cure like seizures you can like can t you like my friend s been cured of that she had them and then now she doesn t anymore because she took medicine and stuff now she doesn t have it but there s people that have been taking those medicines and then still have it now which doesn t make sense is that cured or treated treated yeah cured means that you no longer have the disease treated means that it s managed with medication or it s treated then wait it s cured yeah it is cured but anyways how would that change you as a parent knowing that you would know what to do if you have it stay with your child at all times i don t want my kid dying your kid s going to be in like a stroller until age 13 see it wouldn t change me as a parent it just wouldn t change me i think it d make someone stronger because going through all of that hard times like with your child and it being sick and stuff wouldn t that make you stronger than having a normal healthy child and make you closer to them but you would still love your child the same way you would still try to have the best memories with your child either way if you knew that this that your child was going to die or not you would still do the same thing except maybe change their diet or take more precautions yeah more precautions pad their room they re going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something but you wouldn t change your experiences with your child i would well i wouldn t would you bernard what change your experience with your child yeah just don t go to disneyland it s not worth it it s not worth it he won t even remember it nope oh the fifth question what does any of this have to do with you like as in personally or as in that s a good question i m confused say that again as in personally yeah both ways as in persoanlly and as in a generation give yourself super powers hey stay on task good job stella thanks i guess you re just kind of getting us ready for the future you know like thinking like about your children like in the future like what if like what if you really wanted to know and then like what would you actually do about it if you ve never thought about this before is this technology possible yeah not quite yet so who s going to have to make those decisions us our generation this generation and next generation the genes are us and if you want to know everything about yourself if you want to know then you have to go through the genes but if you don t want to know then you don t have to yeah and so those people that think it s like that want to know should wait what never mind should be able to yeah should be able to and then the people that don t want to know shouldn t harp on them they should just keep their opinions to themselves and see it from their eyes too and just have an open eye to it not being so negative so what happens if say half of society would like to have their genomes sequenced or their children s genome sequenced and the other half does not want to or doesn t have the means to because it s probably going to cost money right what might that how might that impact society as a whole not just the individual as in this country individual s rights are paramount right hmm so it ll be messed up like it is already how,0.0
guys ready yes okay number one start give your idea read the word give your idea of the definition okay what s your word soldier okay and okay you re gonna give your idea what s your idea of soldier i think tax is like when you buy something like the extra yeah one person at a time it goes in order so what s your idea like a government so okay you need help have you ever seen a soldier before taxes for me are where money or something i don t know and what does a soldier do do you know okay he fights for freedom very good so it s someone who fights for freedom that s your definition what s your definition very good you guys keep going you re doing great let me see how this group is doing over here where are you guys at have you already given your definition yes okay did you already give yours did you already give yours did you give yours yet what do you think it is what s the word patriot very good patriot and did you listen to their ideas yeah okay and you need thinking time okay and remember you can build on their ideas too louder a little bit louder i think it means to i think it s you ve heard it in a song that word yeah yeah so someone was a patriot in a song what did it mean in the song if they were a patriot how did they feel they feel sad sometimes sad you can feel sad if you re a patriot on 9 11 when the planes crashed through the buildings people were sad because they were patriots they loved their country right and they were sad to see that can you be happy if you re a patriot too yeah when would you be happy if you were a patriot you re a patriot for the united states right or even for the country your family originally came from how do you feel about that country if you re a patriot happy happy and do you not like them or do you love them that country i love them you love them okay so a patriot is someone that what you could be more excited or happy okay and how do you feel in your heart about the country do you dislike it or do you like it a lot i like it a lot okay alright and i didn t hear your ideas but can you guys get together and agree or do you want to look it up first should we look it up to make sure we have the right idea okay everyone let s get into our books and let me make sure you have your papers too there are your papers too goodness miss bryant got ahead of herself just in case you forget the direction the page is 493 to check go all the way to your glossary page 493 to check let me see what you guys have let s see okay and where does that money go to do you guys know the government oh did you look it up to make sure that it was perfect your definition okay let s look it up real quick and make sure because it looks pretty good but let s just make sure that s my fault because i got busy with table one and didn t give you this paper so on page 493 there you go 493 it starts but then you have to go in abc order right and let s look it up and make sure you have the right definition you guys are looking up tax that s right a t t t t tax good like the way you re using your resource cause that was one of the things we said we re gonna do is use our resource okay what did you get do you know where to read it good i like the way that you worked together and helped so les what did you have taxes for new money to where where does that money go the government okay so let s add that who started this her me okay so you wanna add that you guys all agree yeah you feel good cause it s not just any money for anybody it s money to the government okay so let s add that go ahead good i like the way you used your resource and checked it a patriot is a person who loves and supports their country and that s kinda what you guys said anyway right you said they love is that what you guys said cause i wasn t here earlier did you say stuff like that oh great are all of you patriots do you love your country loves and supports their country okay now what happens it goes to person number two number two you get to read it and they re gonna repeat the question right okay there you go and here s the directions just in case you forget what is it like describe it okay let s repeat what is it like describe it you guys did you repeat let s repeat what is it like describe it okay so before we write you get to start so what is it like can you describe a patriot yes okay what is it like it s like or who is he like cause they re a person right is like someone who will respect their country who s that can you think of a person oh i m sorry honey can you think of a person who s an example let s see describe it so when you think a patriot okay they support their country what else respect the government very good those are good words so you could put that there but we re not gonna write yet right because we re gonna give everyone a chance what would you say what do you think of when you think of patriot and you would describe it if you had to describe it to someone patriot is soldier that s a great example what about you someone respect every city everywhere and respect to everybody to not be very nice can it be also honoring i like that vocabulary word honor how do you guys feel about honoring what do you say about respecting okay alright you get to write first you write one then it ll go around and each of you can write one in a box okay every one of you write something in the box if you need help ask your table for help right okay good how s it goin if something costs 7 99 it s plus like tax plus like a dollar yeah a dollar taxes come in like a dollar or two dollars just put taxes like extra money great okay now you alright so we said it protects the country fights what did you say when you gave ideas fights for his risks his life for others what do you guys think risks his life for others should we include that yeah yeah okay that s good good okay and then you re gonna write one too right what else makes that kuh sound a c and what else k you guys agree okay let s put it down a k risks i like the way you re helping each other that s great alright very nice okay and you get to put an idea down too we wanna make sure everyone gets a chance so put your idea down you can put it in any of the boxes because there s room here here or here no that s fine because we re all gonna keep going yep so i want you to put your idea that you said earlier here here or here for describing the soldier do you remember what you said what d you say very good so put that down tax is more money for the government you can just look in the book just put tax is extra money for the government we already have that oh i know tax is extra money for the government tax is i s for extra money for the government okay so has everyone given an example okay so whose turn was it to write your turn so you write first and make sure everyone gets to write one in tax is extra money for government money money money m o n e yes did you guys give your examples first yeah before you wrote okay good do your parents pay taxes yes they do everyone pays taxes that could be an example i have a question do your parents pay taxes everyone pays taxes don t they do we have to pay taxes when we get gasoline yes yes do we have to pay taxes when we buy a video game yeah everything yes everything except for food food they don t tax isn t that nice of them okay and what does the tax go to support the government the government and the schools right and the firemen the policemen good okay so now you have some more great conversation great conversation was thomas jefferson a patriot martin luther king martin luther king was a patriot good who else was a patriot abraham lincoln yes okay let s take turns though who s turn is it now who s a patriot someone who loves their country are you a patriot could you say i am a patriot i m a patriot very good there s an example can you think of someone who s a patriot a soldier a soldier why s a soldier a patriot why do you think they love their country so much what are they willing to risk their heart their heart and their what they could what could happen if they got shot they die yeah they re risking their lives so they really love their country they re really patriots aren t they very good so you ready to write who s turn is it no that s okay so whoever s next so if it s your turn you go oh okay so it s your turn so you get to write an example of a patriot try to write in a complete sentence i bet you can you just draw pictures,0.0
okay look at your music we are doing four parts obviously with them take just a general idea for the whole thing raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes sopranos where do you have eighth notes shelby tell me measure nine say it really loud so they all hear you measure nine measure nine very good audrey where do you have eighth notes measure thirteen thirteen good reese where do you have eighth notes measure nine and measure measure nine and thirteen hey what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part then same rhythm almost the same rhythm all the way through tenors where do you have eighth notes braden twenty one and twenty two twenty one and twenty two so getting toward the very very end altos tell us something about your part rhythmically raise your hand give me a summation of what you do jamie we don t have any you don t have any at all you only have quarter notes half notes and some whole notes so how many beats does a half note take up everybody two two make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes solf ge what key are we in where is do brady f f major so the first pitch that the altos have is do do sopranos what s your starting pitch mi basses what s your starting pitch do tenors sol very good look at it for a second there are some jumps in the very beginning they don t mess around right away we ve got some eighths and some intervals chant on solf ge your part one and two and three and four and very good go on two three four on the second to last measure on the first page bassists and altos will move stepwise motions so you ll they both go up one step be aware of that notice that we have some repetition do you see some patterns that are coming back so if you miss it the first time you get a second shot where if you get it right the first time remember what it sounds like so you can do it again continuing second page one two three and chant freeze let s go back and join the basses with us at measure nine do re mi everyone measure nine and okay sopranos careful it might screw up your voice why did you have an issue there why did you miss it it s a skip because it s a skip in the melody and why else a practical reason here to here because it s hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one top of the next page measure seventeen a little faster and go sorry seventeen sopranos fa altos la tenors fa basses fa ready hey everybody has fa that might be a good place to find the measure la this will help you re right sorry except the altos listen right there when you re actually singing for that and go you ll have to hold this for a very long time go back to the beginning the rule is number six jesse repeat the last step the last step oh never quit singing never quit singing look up find your keys points okay second key do mi so mi do so do sing your starting note one two three four good now i have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads do a quick run through because it s hard to know i cant remember what i missed i m still freaking out about the whole thing take a minute replay it in your head find areas where there were problems for you overall you did extremely well you listened to each other you could hear that it sounded like music if you weren t sure about an interval you would sing it and then you would go oh this is right yes and you were affirmed and i think you got more confident as you went along problem areas raise your hands if you had one chelsea my problem i had was with measure seventeen seventeen sopranos do to fa that s a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there so then you heard it and you were able to go on and then i liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen finding fa that s a strange function in the music yes patrick measure nineteen fa to la okay nineteen fa to la just making sure that you know where you re moving fa to la where oh nineteen yes sorry my eyes were at seventeen good bass hands excellent thank you grant where twenty twenty yes and what did you do i couldn t figure out the notes i mean i couldn t figure out the i think it surprises you because you move up by a step you were fine so la and the ti you weren t willing to actually sing ti because it s not very often that you sing it stepwise motion so la ti do you did an excellent job basses throughout then returning to so and do when you had it you had some issues with fa and la colin six and seven where we were going from la to fa and then back to do and then we had an eighth notes because of that okay so being aware of when you have eighth notes and chances are there isn t ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don t so when you hear it then you can move with them and it s always by step when you have eighth notes and it s always ascending so you don t have to worry about going down anywhere but yes fa and la continue to be icky i didn t time it we have to sing it again i m so sorry okay so we fixed the things that we missed we re going a little faster so it sounds like music and not just this exercise listen across the room to each other do mi you stayed very well in tune do mi so mi do so do set your key remember you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can if you look up basses i m trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often sing your first note please one two three four have a seat and now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second that means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time and if you haven t had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet it s time because this is opinion time and there s no wrong the room is going to tip over from the hands on this side there are four sections jamie well sometimes they re like a step away from each other but something like i know they re like one long and sometimes i okay so there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time okay hannah i thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time i would agree the first time you did better than the second there are a couple of reasons for this raise your hand if you feel like when you think back on how well you ve done both times you did better the first time why why emily because you were so focused and trying to get it right so the second time we ve already gone through it so we relaxed a little and little things slip up okay some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much what else possibly colin i think some of us got a little too over confident ohhh that s an excellent thing to check just making sure some of you don t get a little over confident although basses the fa s and la s were much better this time as an overall section amanda if the first time usually there s a few problem areas for me then i try to focus on them way too much and then i see the spots where it might have been tricky for me like that jump from la to do so i freak myself out about that even though i got it right both times you get stuck in your head a little bit yeah okay so doubting yourself and then not being sure what else can happen ariella along with what emily said about how we sometimes get over confident because we ve already seen it and we just fly by it because we re not really trying to pay attention to it too much okay ryan measure nine it s the so so mi i went back to the so because that s what we did on the first page oh okay because you re remembering now the patterns that you had you get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time that s a good thought too michaella between the and because we to sing notes over and over again over and over again i didn t like it it s kind of hard i didn t get the first two notes right and finally on like the third note i think i just figured out what we were doing patrick i think that sometimes because we ve already sung the music and now i think that we kind of know what s going on,0.0
okay i can see two in here can you read the article first please yes loudly the president of the republic should be an egyptian born to egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights his age must not be less than 40 gregorian years mm hmm i agree with the president um mm hmm he should be egyptian born to egyptian parents because it will have make him have well rounded perspectives and it may lead him to having interests to other countries and so it would make him have interest or will not make him prevent him it would not prevent him to um from getting to a different country s interest than his country okay good job i agree with yessenia because if both if he s from parents that are egyptians he can have some connection with egyptians and he won t have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have and um have like wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different mm hmm that s what i that s what my opinion yeah that s why i agree with her good i disagree with the part of the where it says that they should be egyptian parents mm hmm but i agree with jesus and his concerns about the egyptian parents but my opinion is that they should have at least one parent egyptian and the other another race mm hmm because if one parent s egyptian like the child or the becoming president would have a something of concerns and would know some parts of egypt and its government and if the other and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries states okay good job which the legislative process good job i agree with yessenia and jesus because if they re from egypt and their parents are egyptian then they can have some cultural background and they ll know more from people and they ll have connections with the people good good so now what is the result now do you think you re going to change the part i see i ve heard some different opinions here are you going with the change or do you want to keep it as it is i think we should keep it as it is because i mean that s a good thing to have egyptian parents and a background like hilda said a background of culture mm hmm so i ll say yes leave it just leave it the same okay just that part okay very good so you will just leave that part as it is without change is there any other parts for this article yeah there s a second part his age must not be less than 40 gregorian years mm hmm um i disagree because um when you re young you ll know more about technology and computers and everything mm hmm and that s how um the youth and younger children in egypt that s how they went and communicate i agree with yessenia a lot because when a president is younger but not old he can connect with the youth and other younger people because when egypt was in the revolution the president was 81 years old mm hmm mm hmm eighty four and behind the revolution was the young and they were like younger so he didn t really understand them really well and they didn t understand him well because he was a little older than them so for me i ll say 35 um yeah that s a good age for the president they can connect with teenagers and people of younger i just very good i like the connection that you made jesus between the age and the people who were behind the revolution good job i disagree with jessie and jesus good yeah because i think that part of the constitution is okay because 40 um 40 years is makes them have plenty of experience and to doing his their work and like it makes them like for like what jesus said about technology they can learn about it and they can show them and all so basically they they ll pretty much know who do you mean by they the becoming president that the old or the young the old the older one he cannot understand or work with technology that much yeah because jesus said that they um they won t know about technology much mm hmm but they if they re 40 they would have plenty of experience mm hmm and they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens you know okay good good i agree with emi but i agree with jesus and yessenia so mm hm that s okay um because focus on what you want to do like youth was like 70 or 80 of egypt oh good but if he s older he s going to have more responsibilities mm hmm and he can be more responsible mm hm so i disagree with hilda responsibility because when they re younger they re more active and more responsible like they can remember most things where they keep stuff and when they re active they can like travel through egypt and see what s wrong with the country and what s wrong with the economy and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country so i ll say the younger but not too young like 35 and up thank you my opinion is that 40 is okay because the young the young people like at 35 because 35 s not that young but lower than that can make a little bit of difficulties because they make they might make like a mistake they might not know a thing and they just put another thing you mean they will not be mature enough yeah mature sure good like the 40s the 40 year old people like they they pretty much know everything they learn it they were educated the government laws and mm hmm this and that mm hmm but i think that part is 40 years is better good so you would like to say okay just to open or or or break it down to so young like 30 or 20 or even teenager right well i like that the two parts that you brought hilda about 70 that the majority of the population of egypt are already youth and your part that you said that this will make jesus that that will make help them to have good connection with the young people there good job so what did you decide on i see that you re going with certain direction we should change it the first part of the statement of art 75 mm hmm which is the constitution we should keep that as it is and the second part of the 40 years we should change it well we should leave it like that as well very good i like how you are compromising with them emi and you are going with the change so what part are you going to change um it will be transforming to what thirty five mm hmm thirty five years not less than 35 not less good job excellent very good after you take your notes let s move to the next article article 77 the term of the presidency shall be gregorian six gregorian years starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the mm hmm the president of the republic may be re elected for other successful years mm hmm i disagree with the six years um yes mm hmm yes keep going because i think it s a little longer and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president um having them over again and i think it should be lower for four years like in america and some of the disadvantages are that people could like him and he might be re elected for another six more years um people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country and that s what i think of for the first one what do you all think about it you think the first one should be as it is or changed changed to four years changed to four years yeah okay what do you think i agree i agree with jesus because an example of this is hosni mubarak he he um was following supposedly the terms of the constitution which which he made an excuse and took many chances in um having the presidency so i for like 30 years so i my opinion is to lower it down to four years and if they re re elected which they can use democracy like here in america mm hmm if they re re elected they will have at least 12 years basically okay do you disagree um the statement i agree because it will give them more stability and more time to elect mm hmm i agree with jesus and emi why do you agree with them because six years is a lot of years and if they don t like him they ll have to wait a lot a long time so that another president can come into power okay so you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years yes okay the second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years the thing i dislike about this is that they don t really explain how um the terms for example the president of egypt um used an excuse to be re elected because um he said that in the constitution it said it didn t say specifically how much how many terms um they lead so i ll i ll change that that um leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected um very good point luis i didn t um jesus i m sorry very good point here you brought really a very important point and this is what will this was like the concern of many people over there the specification of of what successful terms of the how many terms very good successive terms very good does anybody have an opinion or disagreement uh i i agree with okay i agree with um you because that s what hosni mubarak was really he was making excuse to like stay um him how like it is to keep him as a president and re elect him over and over to um and he was telling them that he was following the constitution because their theory said there was like no number of yeah so he i agree also because like you said the example of hosni mubarak was the serious serious excuse they um the people were basically mad at them that um certain term because they didn t give a number of the terms so um that s why hosni mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over very good when the point of staying too many years in power or in office that brings to me something that s going on in other two countries you remember any of the other countries in the middle east and africa that has something going on there because of this specific part libya and yemen what s going on in libya now they re protesting against um gaddafi very good yes good job i like how you remembered his name why why they are protesting against him because he d been in power for like about 43 years good job mm hmm okay what else is going on in another country or what country is having something going on yemen yemen yemen very good okay well this brings us to go back again a little further something about different types of governments remember egypt was a republic okay when their the president stayed there for so many years that will not be a republic country that will be what a dictatorship a dictatorship very good that will be a dictatorship so the the the type of government is if government is not a the republic or maybe democracy as they say or claim but it will be it will be a dicta a dictatorship very good and the people in power the people in the office government office will be what dictators okay it s because they do what they want to do and they don t listen to other people okay and what is another name for dictatorship or very close to it,0.0
more important cause their friend maser something died the day before and they stayed in the village for that long they didn t have to stay but they decided to stay they didn t have to do that but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important well and it may have been a choice for safety also if they stay with him if they run to another village they may be you know picked off trying to stick to the customs that they are so used to like back in normal life and stuff like that so trying to get back in that but the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life like their parents and stuff but saved their lives yeah okay emily and simon simon emily emily and spencer i mean simon that s her last name do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village and blaming him for missing i think anyone would get mad they need to get it out on someone what do you mean by being right to get mad do they have like a valid purpose a valid reason for getting mad i mean yeah they were probably just mad out of frustration if you would have went in with them before like earlier before the rebels attacked they wouldn t have been able to see their families so that s what their drive has been for the past couple months or however long they ve been running it s to get back to their families even if they would have died i mean that s what he was saying is that he was mad at him at dishmrael for holding him back because he could have seen his family he would have died but then later on when his mind cooled down he was like yeah well he saved my life cause i would have been killed it was probably like an in the moment thing i think in that kind of situation you always look for someone to blame cause there is no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them so we should hurry and go see them he thought they had time to go and see their family like let s stop and rest and stuff like that there s no way he could have known that was gonna happen so they can t really blame him but they need to blame someone yeah i d want to punch someone too i d be so mad if that happened to me i understand why they would blame him but looking back on it and how does his age impact that also well he s not he not really old enough to really think about it all he s thinking about is his family with maturity you think before you act but as a little kid you just act and don t know the consequences well and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all there s another aspect and he used to follow junior and everything he did but now that junior s gone he doesn t even have that right exactly okay keep going war is hell oh yeah you can sorry about that it s okay so want to go kaylee okay ask the question the question girda is a young woman at the time of the book and so was valentino and wutuzuwut how do they change through the course of the book due to the tragic events in their lives i think they re forced to grow up real fast because of all the pressures at the time i mean valentino doesn t know his age but let s say like 15 and 20 and when i haven t read the end of this book but she comes home to america and so does valentino and they just come over and even though they re like like a 40 year old so it s kinda weird coming back to america and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures yeah the whole event just kinda makes them you know kinda step it up a bit if something like this happens to you you don t easily forget it it becomes more of a part of you it kinda takes out who you really are inside yeah it shapes you yeah well and how did the stages in their life coincide that s a good question kaylee well first of all genocide i thought was basically kind of done the same so it was usually like they lost their families they re forced to go out on their own they re forced to make a life for themselves and both of them kind of think or know that their parents are dead and so they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them cause i think ile or i don t know how to say her name she kind of motivated girda to kind of stay in the camp with her and have maybe a friend there where with abek s family she wouldn t really have a friend she d just have like she d owe it to their family to do things for them and then with achek he had william k to help him just had a friend to make it through yeah so they both had a strong friend what kind of life did they both live before disaster struck they both had the perfect ideal family life you know they were happy they were all together it was you know like what would happen in a disney movie pretty much everything s kinda perfect and then something happens in the first both in the person that happens to meet their family ties are cut and their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them and kinda grow and become stronger yeah i think yeah no you go okay they were just i mean they were forced to grow up and they just lived like ryan said like the ideal life with their family or whatever but once their parents left they had to find a friend or someone to group with in order to well what were they replacing what were they replacing with william k and ile yeah they established a family without being blood related they just had to make it through by that it s cause if you don t have motivation then you re not going to get through things so even though they didn t know that their i mean they assumed their parents were dead but they didn t know for sure cause on page 80 of this i mean she said that she never saw her father again but just to know that their parents are alive and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive not knowing they both have that in common right assuming that they re dead but not really knowing for sure just to keep them motivated to survive so it s a good tactic so what is a really simple message that we can take from that from both of their stories what do you need in your life motivation you need family you need some kind of family unit to survive or friends everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to and they can depend on no matter what the situation is right and if you re going to friends a lot of time at least in like a high school or whatever you go to friends with questions instead of your family or whatever sometimes you ll get the wrong side of view on things and it will change your life drastically cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be determines how the rest of your life but also you got a different perspective cause your family doesn t necessarily know what s going on in your own high school yeah so it s good to get both but family is more important cause you can count on them more usually and they re older and wiser you need that kind of like wise person cause my mom knows more than i do or my friends yeah but you need those relationships as connections right right to keep motivated both of those stories show that really literally life and death situations those connections with other humans it is a human basic need that we have to make those connections or you cannot survive i think both of those stories that s a really good question in looking at the stages it also shows globally globally what can we say about families at the beginning of the story you were talking about it s like a disney movie right yeah so what can we say about families literally around the world they re all usually together nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where like how they re supposed to live and like what s good and bad you usually nurture your kids til they re about nineteen and then they go off to college i think that s just how it is everywhere it may not be that way in some places but you usually have schooling and then you go off and then you figure out for yourself once you ve got a base yeah they re usually pretty perfect or ideal until like a third party like nazis or the arabians come in and just wipe that out and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves and i guess their friends since they didn t have family and that family unit seems to lend to safety even if you re living in sudan or if you re living in poland the children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives right right and if nobody knows you what makes you if you die who would care that s what i would think like if nobody cared about me or nobody knew who i was that s what a lot of suicidal thoughts yeah i was just thinking i don t think that but i m just saying if i had nobody to be like i care about you you need to stay alive or like your parents there wouldn t be a reason to live yeah but like in those stories like they find symbolic fixtures or whatever i think in both yeah the moon they look at the moon and they see they just see the moon and it s like their kinda friend but they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere or wherever they are cause they don t know yeah their parents are looking at the same thing that they re seeing kinda yeah so it s kinda like right there keeping them together and what s funny is that s a main the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone yeah and he refers to that also i think cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth it s a connection i think somewhere yeah yeah totally it s kinda like the bright light in darkness you know the night it s a pictch black but the moon s shining you know kinda there no matter what good okay keep going and the german s are just coming in and everything s getting really bad and like going back to their past and showing it as such a nice place what she does is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison okay what was the question how does the author implement setting to contrast good and evil how is it affected okay purpose and we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker because it s happening in this nice place but she s forced to saying the dark side of things cause she s forced into her basement where it s all dark and you know there s mildew on the wall and it s flooded and it s just really gross down there and that s what s happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in and then her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days you know running with her friends and chasing butterflies and eating sweets and it s just really happy and bright and cheery and so there s a major contrast and as you go into the book does that darkness continue or is it broken by light how does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps there s go ahead but i have an answer ok at least up to the point where we ve read she s kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything arthur s letters stopped coming and that s kind of the climax from how far we ve gotten where the darkness is so now it s about finding the good things that are in that darkness right i think she has little flashes of good things and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her of a bright future but it is surrounded by darkness and in the camp did she talk about physically light and dark also like the dramas and she wrote plays and they had fun there the single light shining in the dark room do you have anything to add abbey can you think of times when she talked about light physically light in the camps i was trying to think and how does she portray it cause that is an interesting motif in the book the light and dark and it will continue to play a part which camp is she in at the middle part she s in the i can t pronounce it it s the first one where she s they re sewing they re weaving so they re at the looms right yeah they re at the looms did she pass through auschwitz or was that the one she was in jail i think she passed through volkenheim yeah does she ever get outside that would be a key at volkenheim outside of the camp itself just outside in the outside well here s a reference to outside she talks about how the night was starry and beautiful from heirgonk i could see the hill through a window slowly the full moon rose so that is like a light in the darkness literally because the stars the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky and just her finding that comfort in that also shows really extreme light and dark but her comfort comes at night in the darkness and she has one source of light so keep looking for those motifs of light and dark cause they play a part throughout have any of you gotten past the halfway point yeah yeah we ve gotten a little bit past in the march you know that becomes very important alright good good job alright you guys bell s gonna ring keep your questions for tomorrow,0.0

we have been talking about being a good speaker and a good listener and in class your teacher had you do an activity in your classroom where you sat across the way from a student and you read them a paper that you had written about dingoes and then you had to stand up in front of the class and you had to present that do you remember that okay so we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener and your teacher and i worked on a rubric and you got a grade for some different things about speaking do you remember what any of those things were that you got a grade on do you remember what she was looking for posture posture what do you mean by posture not moving around okay so when you re standing up in front of the class what would you look like standing straight okay not leaning against the wall okay good do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like voice okay what about your voice what should your voice do use your presentation voice yeah like a presentation voice does it sound like this what does a presentation voice sound like kind of loud but not like an outside voice yeah kind of loud but not screaming right i like how you said not an outside voice all right what else for speaking do you remember what else one of them i know didn t really have to do with speaking but it had more to do about your report and it was did your report make sense right did what you write make sense what about if i read my report really slow is that good i can t remember it starts with an f fl fluency fluency good and what does that mean you re not reading slow or too fast good not too slow not too fast just right okay so we have posture voice makes sense fluency do you remember what the last one was you re not doing it right now eye contact good all right you want to make eye contact right right so when you re reading you want to be able to do what see the people yeah look at the audience right kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people okay now if i m a good listener if i m the person sitting in the audience how can i show my classmates that i m being a good listener no distractions okay so don t distract them what else don t be distracted by someone else okay so you want to focus on the speaker all right how can you show them that you re focused on them how would they know look at them yeah look at them right okay look at the speaker and what else what about at the end when they re done ask questions good ask questions anything else sit up straight okay good could you tell them maybe how they did what do we call that like feedback what they did well on or maybe what they could do better right okay put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at what do you think you do a good job at okay you re focused on the speaker all right you sit up straight okay you don t distract others that s good okay now out of these two which one do you think you need to work on which one could you do a better job that one okay so maybe you could ask more questions at the end okay all right what about speaking which ones do you think you do a good job at already posture okay you do a good job on that one make sense mm hmm eye contact mm hmm okay so out of your voice and fluency which one do you think you could do better which one could you work on the voice voice all right so what do you think you need to do better with your voice speak up louder speak up louder maybe a little bit closer to like that presentation voice okay on your rubric it was what five four three two one do you remember what you got on your volume three a three okay so miss welch thought you could do a little better too so maybe next time you could get a four or a five okay so we have been talking about famous african americans and you had said that walter payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting right all right so we are going to look at some information about walter payton and then see if we can maybe do better on asking questions and maybe working on your volume okay cool okay so austin the other day you and i met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about walter payton and the first one was i was speaking and you were videotaping me and then we flipped it and i videotaped you so what i want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out and then we re going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future okay so we looked up some facts about walter payton and let s watch my speech first and i want you to be thinking about while you watch me how did i do on eye contact how did i do on my volume how was my fluency did it make sense and how was my posture okay on a scale of one to five five being woo hoo miss suzer you did a great job and one meaning miss suzer i didn t even see that at all okay all right you ready all right let s see how i did walter payton was one of the best running backs in the nfl he played for the bears after going to college in mississippi sweetness has over 110 questions but he died in 1999 of liver cancer he s one of the best football players of all time i wish i could have seen him play he was my favorite football player all right so let s see what do you think do you want to use purple or blue you want to be purple okay so how do you think i did on eye contact what do you think you think a four okay why do you think a four did i give much eye contact no no oh you re saying yes i only saw myself look up once so i m going to give myself a two i don t think i did a very good job you re too nice alright how was my volume pretty good okay i think i ll agree with you there how was my fluency or my rate good okay i think i m going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where i thought maybe i could have talked a little faster i don t know all right did it make sense what i said yeah okay and how was my posture was i standing up straight looking ahead okay i wasn t like swaying or rocking or anything all right so it looks like overall i think i need to do better on eye contact and you thought i could probably do a little better on eye contact and i think i could do a little better on my fluency i think i could have maybe spoke a little bit faster it sounded like i was kind of in slow motion okay so now let s watch how you did and then we ll grade you okay all right so here you are okay let s see all right how do you think your eye contact was a one why did you give yourself a one because i didn t really look up you didn t look up at all did you were you looking at your paper what were you concentrating on paper the paper okay yeah i would say it would be good maybe if you held your paper down at your belly button right and then you could look up all right how was your volume not evident okay i m going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you i think the reason we couldn t hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face i think your voice might have gone out a little bit more all right how was your fluency or your rate what do you think i didn t hear myself at all okay all right i thought it wasn t bad at all i thought it was pretty good because when i could hear you i thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four you weren t reading really fast you were reading so that i could understand you it was just kind of hard to hear all right do you think your facts made sense why did you give yourself a two i don t know i had some in there and i don t know all right because you could only hear parts of it you think if your volume had been better you could have heard more okay all right i m going to give you a four because i think it made sense all right what about your posture how was your posture man you re being hard on yourself why did you give yourself a one because i wasn t i was like wiggling around a little bit yeah okay well i m not going to be that hard i m going to give you a three okay so if we were going to do this again maybe in front of your class or in front of your teacher or something what would you do differently next time now that you ve seen yourself what would you do differently maybe the things you got ones on right okay so maybe looking up over your paper maybe your volume yep maybe working on your fluency or your rate maybe a little faster right what about your posture what would you do differently stand straight okay try to stand still all right so it looks like we have a couple things we could work on right for next time okay sounds good,0.0
who s gonna do the skyscraper so we got to put size color and shape size color and shape ok i m gonna do a skyscraper beau is that for the past or the present that s for the present skyscraper present the present the present ok and the pyramid is for the past yeah and you ll do a pyramid for the past i was gonna do a log cabin that s what i was gonna do but we have to use different things because we don t got no logs well actually they still make log cabins now we can use brown for the logs jonathon says they still make log cabins now they do yeah they do we don t really make pyramids any more do we no yeah but they could be hidden in egypt yeah but there is four lines what we gonna do with the other two what i want you to do is list three details color size and shape so what shape will your skyscraper probably be a rectangle a rectangular prism a rectangular prism that s what dillon said rectangle rectangular prism okay then you can talk about your pyramids ask them they re your team a square pyramid triangle oh he said a square pyramid yeah let s do it a triangle you think it should be a triangular pyramid yeah i m with dillon well talk about it which one do you want to do i thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid you know because it has four sides it does have four a pyramid only has four sides well a triangle has four too it does one two three four that s a square honey because it has four well if it has three sides how many sides does it have three three so you have to decide so we could take a square and make it like a dillon agrees a square pyramid too i love having y all together let s do square pyramid and rectangular prism good deciding alright what are you guys discussing right now we re discussing what all we wanna do i like that okay we re not sure what play we re doing you re not sure what play you wanna do because everybody keeps picking everything so how are we gonna figure it out but i agree with randy so what do you guys agree on i agree with my plans he wants like an old time car and i don t agree with that but we don t understand how you do an old time car how do you do a play or skit about an old car that s what you need to tell them the only time okay aaron said something about the classroom and that i was going to be the teacher or something like that i wanna be assistant teacher randy likes that and this is two people from the past and two people from the present hear what jacob said jacob wants to be assistant teacher you re the teacher assistant teacher so when will that be in the past or the present present haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too and then we ll come to where they are then they ll have to show us what changed did y all hear aaron s idea you can say that to them i like aaron s idea listen to what aaron just said guys he has an idea that you may want to do ian and jacob and haley are from the present and me and randy are from the past and we come and they show us all the stuff that has changed i agree with aaron i agree with aaron i agree with aaron or we could do like you two are teachers and like me and aaron and ian are like students and then them two teach us oh that s an idea you could do but then how do we do the past well but you could do the past and then how could you do a skit about the past and a skit about the present yeah they would be the same except one is the past and one is the present to where like no one had desks and then in the present we have desks oh what do you think ian i wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future well are we doing the future or the present present well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present okay well decide it sounds like you got some really good ideas why can t we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present and you choose your own people who live in the present well ian if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea yeah you choose your own people but you do it in the present sounds like y all have to just keep on you may just have to make a decision ok you may just have to make a decision sounds like you are doing great guys how do you spell transfer trucks huh how do you spell transfer trucks transfer trucks let s sound it let s tap it what letters t trrr a n c e r or something trr like tree t r you got it shannon did you hear shannon let s tap it ta jarius trr aaa a what letter is that nnnn n ssss c k s ssss transssss s i got s f f how do you make er at the end of a word e r you got it there you go and you know trucks so what are y all doing with transfer trucks i don t know he s the one who wanted to write it why was this on noah s desk case has some names yeah ok but what but why did y all um you re describing what each persons job will be and i have that noah and ta jarius and madison are gonna do what the waves what kind of waves what are y all showing from the past and the present i wanna do waves in the present do waves change from the past to the present do you mean like ocean waves have those changed over time i m doing transfer trucks what s it suppose to be a i m doing transfer trucks how have those changed over time horses carried them with like umbrella s over them very cool and we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier and you said that was like a truck you could pull that up back up there i could pull it back up do you wanna see that again cash do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time shannon what are you doing what are your illustrations gonna be showing change over time she might do cars or something do you wanna do cars you don t have to do cars you don t want to lots of things have changed over time you can actually buy food and not hunt it how do you spell shannon that s one of the things you could draw the change from the maybe you ll do washing machines yeah yeah that works yeah cars change do you wanna do transfer trucks no you re already doing them guys do you wanna do washing machines madison draw a washing machine next to that you wanna do washing machines can you hold that up so they can see it because shannon can t see it where did ya wash your clothes at turn it over like this and you d rub them against here different isn t it yeah when i was little my great great great great great great great grandma grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when i was big i was allowed to see it very cool there was a picture alright it sounds like you ve got some work to do guys i love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time i think we need to think about waves though because waves are a natural thing people don t really build and change those do we no so we need to think about something that has changed over time and don t forget our books buildings buildings buildings have definitely changed over time alright guys keep it up you are doing great alright let s see what you guys are up to okay what s going on over here well we re thinking about about cassa coloring ann coloring and me coloring and drawing and her drawing i love drawing you love drawing that s what i love i love typing at home i love all of it very cool alright so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing we re gonna show the style the color okay can you tell me what you re gonna draw we re gonna draw dresses oh dresses and shoes like dresses and the shoes that they would wear i can get my old dress my mom s old dress she s got i have it and i can design it you can uh huh so are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present yes or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present we re gonna do it all together i love that them two are coloring i m coloring and me and her are drawing very nice you re drawing yes we re drawing i m coloring very very nice well it looks like you guys are ready for your next page let me ask you this how has clothing changed over time the color has definitely changed the colors have changed and the shoes ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses oh so they used to wear really long dresses and now they have short dresses that come up to here yeah and shoes they wear lace up boots laced up boots i think my mama has them i won t be able to wear them but i might be able to bring them oh that d be cool if you bring those it sounds like you have great ideas and they wore hats back then cause i m thinking about my mom s dress i mean i can design it i am very very pleased with how much you ve accomplished together in your group let me get you the next sheet okay we all have our things done and we re going to get it and we all have each others phone numbers here s the next sheet let s look for a second who will design the piece from the past and who will design the piece from the present now that doesn t mean it has to be separate right you can take it home well me and her well it sounded like we re all okay yeah we re all basically doing it okay why is this change important to people today and how could this continue to change in the future hmmmm there s some questions to think about so have you worked on this some more you ve decided to what you re gonna do skyscrapers and pyramids they re doing the pyramids me and him is doing the skyscrapers them two are doing the pyramids we re doing the skyscrapers that was nice good going coming up with that good job we re doing a square pyramid you re doing a square pyramid yeah that s easy all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top so when i was with you before you said this is hard we don t know what we re gonna do and all had different ideas and as it turns out this is kind of easy what made it easier working as a team working as a team dillon would you mind sitting over here sweetie so that everybody can hear and see what you re doing yeah kinda off by himself over there huh sweetheart alright the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is how has this changed over time buildings how have buildings changed over time pyramids pyramids been tooken down did we ever build buildings out of gold no i got something pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in eygpt like more land okay what about buildings in general how is this building different from mcwilliams it s bigger it s bigger and has more space which one is bigger mcwilliams and it s newer it s newer so how do you it s newer or it s smaller he says it s newer,0.0
that one hurts it says volume by use the formula to find the volume okay so i got 53 when i added up the numbers yeah i did too i took it and divided by three 17 6666 just do 17 6 no 17 point three sixes so we ll just just no hayden we have to find 17 666 cause all six of them put 17 6 i know but we are now let s just round it up one to 18 okay yeah so with average it s 18 okay so now we have to do based on our average how close were you to your guess so how close were we to our guesses so like i was close by seven i was close by nine we have 18 here how far was nine and 18 i don t know nine nine plus nine is 18 right oh yeah so write nine right here i was by five okay all right based on our average how many drops would it take to make one liter 18 000 what oh yeah you got us correct a few times multiply it by if we had it to drops times 1000 cause that s how many milliliters are in a liter we get 10 000 okay so now we do water disposal follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid so first we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter so we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this so giselle you wanna do that no okay that yeah pour it so this gets to 20 okay i ll pour it then oops whoa okay try not to put too much i ll pour it out let s try again it with a dropper no you re supposed to do it with a beaker i know but if we re really really close and we can t do it with a beaker then we re gonna have to do it with a dropper so we just do this okay we re at 20 i think that s 20 we re at 19 i got it okay just don t drop it too fast cause i okay okay so now we have to add the three marbles so we ll bring em on this side yeah you have one hayden has one and i have one no let alina have one you do alina poured the water so it s you amy and hayden okay okay so we have to like tilt it to roll down the cylinder i think i can do it yeah i know but it s the easiest way no not that much you don t wanna don t wanna pour some out sayonara sucker okay the water level now is 26 exactly all right so it went from 20 to 26 so the difference in volume is six and the volume of the three marbles is six right what do you think alina yeah how do you think i got six i don t know well subtracted 20 from 26 because it s 20 before the marbles and 26 after so the marbles must be okay kay how we doin over here pretty good all right i m gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume what have you learned about volume so far whenever you alina look at the board that i made for you okay whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder what s happening to the volume what happened what happened to the volume of the water it was at 20 and then 26 it got higher it went higher it went higher okay so we can say then that volume does what what did it do rise it rose okay volume rises okay so the volume rose good and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement did you get that far yet yep okay we got six because the water was at 20 before and then after we put the marbles in it was at 26 so it s six cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20 good okay if you can switch places with me i wanna be able to hear alina okay all right so i m gonna ask you another question when you were doing if you got six if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have we need to change that to a solid measurement okay this is the solid measurement cubes that we use to measure solids marbles are solids so alina can you can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes to centimeter cubes each one of those is a gram and if each one of these is a gram that s correct and if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed and all and in that case it must also be equal to one gram so that s why for this i wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams i could also figure out that these are our three marbles and we have six grams then each one of them is 15 grams okay but grams is that a unit of volume or is that a unit of mass mass mass good alina it s a unit of mass so what hayden said is correct one centimeter one milliliter is equal to one gram one milliliter of water is equal to one gram but what do we know about the cubic centimeters we need to put the units in this term so if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles then how can we change it to centimeters cubed how many milliliters is this is one centimeter cubed do you remember one it s a one to one ratio like eli told us in home room so six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed so and this is the unit of volume but you re also right the mass must be it will also be equal to one gram but we re talking about volume not mass so it s the weight it s the volume yeah it has to do with three times three times four but you have to explain why because so how do we know this but why do we do that you don t know the answer right now because it said that three cubic centimeters and a height of three cubic centimeters i don t know if that s really a three with a height of four yeah with a height of four so we have to do our work cause we built the work right there and like height from a and the height hold on so so summer three times three and then yeah times four i m up to three times three that s nine and then times four gives you three times when i did this it was four times three i know that is so three times 16 no three times three is nine times four is okay it s three times four okay it s nine times four why would that be 60 36 yeah so we did three times three we calculated nine times three so that gives you nine and then because there s a height of three you multiply by four which gives you 36 because it s a basic math problem and it gives you 36 okay so explain why you know that and then and then we go on to number two but wait for her to finish i am i m just gonna be a little change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try and it and explain of course not because we re gonna feel like i think is something s wrong well we can well i guess if no we can t cause you can take that one off the building height no we could tip this over this way and solve for why would you do that what we re done with problem one so now so i guess we could yeah but no but in we d still have we would still have the same volume all right so the next problem is can you change summer are you still i m fine i know but we already read it though she can read she needs to read it ryan so what say we couldn t because the numbers we ll have to do the oh wait no no we could no because like we won t we re doing the height and we turn it sideways yes we would it s true okay so so how are you guys doing for number two we wanted to we had it like this and we wanted to turn it sideways cause that would change the height around okay so let s talk about number two that s the one you re on i m completely knocked it over all right so the question is on number two can you change the length width can you change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume try it and explain okay so first of all the first rectangular prism you built so this rectangular prism okay was one centimeter i mean three centimeters long we did three times three it was nine because it had a line so three times three is nine then times four times height of four i don t know okay so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one correct okay and then you just multiply its length times its width times its height and what did you get summer i got 36 36 and i m thinking that more than one thing can equal 36 like if we had okay so how many cubes did you use to get this two for 36 this 36 how many cubes were there in all in all that was 36 it was 36 you had to count out the cubes right so can you use the same but have like a different height but have a different length width and height well yeah the answer would be yes because more there are multiple pieces you could do six like well you do two three and six okay two times three equals six six times six equals 36 two times three times six would equal 36 right as long as the three would be height so six could be this okay summer what do you think they think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes could you still use 36 cubes build a rectangular prism and but get different numbers here you can why do you think so because it has to change it from then like the 36 would still be the same,0.0
anything else so what composter would you want i think we would want maybe like a three tray or four tray vermicomposter and i do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper maybe you guys have a different idea maybe i was thinking that maybe we can make one because i printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter so again that would save us a lot of money just to make it like this might cost 20 to get all these supplies and i know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this and this might cost 20 when a store bought one off the internet may cost 100 yes but the store bought one s are quality and a professional makes it so they know what they re doing i doesn t really matter i mean it has the same purpose it does the same thing i just matters on the worms the only thing that we really have to buy is the worms dylan and ben i got to admit i do agree with claire buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about i know it says what do we know about now where are you guys in your conversation we re deciding to do wood metal or plastic but he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust it could rust because of the moistness of the compost okay it s not metal we re not talking about metal so we might do plastic on what if we make it purchasing one no if we make our own but this one is award winning seventy dollars all right and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class this is buying a vermicomposter that would cost 70 and what did you say about yours this is about like 20 because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes and we need two of them and it says the cost is about five dollars each and that would save us a lot so we could get weebly pro tools and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags so what are your thoughts on helping the whole community i think we should build this because it s better and we would have more money left over and how would you spend the other money left over i would spend it on like stuff that we need for composting like for tools okay wait we have multiple conversations going here in this group so let s wait i would spend it on the tools weebly pro and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost and then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out and that way you could get more money and then we could get something else what s weebly pro it s like an extra you can search it up on google isn t it a website it s 26 compost and then you can have a many slides as you want videos and then we can sell our compost on the internet and that would help a lot so how is the weebly pro better than the weebly that we already have because you were the webmaster on the class website on the composting website and you want to what do you want us to do we can have buy the six month plan and then the guys for next year they figure it out and how would us buying the weebly pro help the community it would help us to sell it and to inform about compost okay any other comments or thought we could it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own okay inform who be more specific the viewers of the website all of our guests yeah there s a greater chance it s not gonna fail guys we re not playing the what if game i not saying but we have a chance that the cups might break because they re cups and they have an easier chance it has a bigger chance of not failing we have to take risks we have to plus you would have the pride of making your own if we make our own and we mess up then we re just wasting money what if what if what if what it i m not doing the what if cause remember last time when we built a if you make it there is a greater chance you will fail maybe instead of cups we use pvc pipes i mean they re that cheap and i mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups shhh too many people that s better quality i do agree with you adam but i also do agree with dylan and ben on two different subjects guys why don t we just make everything we can make the compost bin but if we make everything reusable bags why don t we buy the vermicomposter and then we make the bags the reusable bags are more like for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag and then the tools we might really need later on when we don t need the reusable bags we might need the tools or we said we might need to go buy this now and it might be too late already what s the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags jessica what s the major difference between the two in vermicomposting it keeps reproducing there s three products while the reusable bags when you sell them once and that s all you get from that bag and with the vermicomposter it keeps going it s very unlikely almost impossible that all the worms are going to die in one night plus why would you buy the bags if you can make them cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags like walmart and target bags and she melts them down and puts them into a bag why don t we buy the vermicomposter so it s a better quality and we make the bags they re easier it s very hard to find a perfect vermicomposter that s plastic and won t break most of them are terracotta and they ll shatter if somebody knocks it over it s also wood and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad how do you know we re going to do wood compost things on the internet are using either terracotta or wood terracotta shatters really easily okay so we need to do more research on this i found a four tray bin that s plastic for 89 99 but still why would we pay 100 when we can pay for quality a mere 20 i know but the materials we use aren t made for composting listen to carly for a second what carly because if we do what ben s mom s friend can do you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter do you think you could get your mom s friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does i think we should buy the vermicomposter first like buy it or make it and then buy the reusable bags so just like ben s mom s friend s bags but we should make them both because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools like a new aerator if we make the reusable bags we won t get to put our symbol on it which i think is part of the bag we re thinking about doing ovens cause it s like one two three four five six if we made it we wouldn t have a guarantee that it would work because we could screw up the way we make it or we could just mess it up in general but if we bought one it would be kind of guaranteed to work but sometimes we miss a part or a tool that we need to put it together how do you know that sometimes what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren t always there because when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools so we couldn t do one part of it and then it just all got all messed up it just threw us off so from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something we don t always get it this part is the leading thing right there it comes built all we have to do it put the plastic bars together and it will be kind of easy cause it just like goes yeah and you can work as a group to make it because it s like those styrofoams where you pull it together and you can just see where it s put together the sticks like the couplers on the sides so we have something to be proud of that we made everybody said that we wanted a see through one so we could actually see the dirt and this one s not see through so if we made our own could we get a clear tote cause the worms don t like light so you can lift to look and the worms don t like light so when you look at it lift it up look at it and then put it back down that s a good idea no one else has thought about that christian and how do you know that the worms don t like light because we looked it up on the internet and then one time i was in my house and i saw a worm out in the street and it was kind of like rattling rattling in the sun so then my sister kicked it in back in the grass so then it was much happier and i re research that okay but do we have to do vermicompost no we don t have to do it at all it s going to be our class we need to vote on what s going to be the best for the community what about reusable bags i think the reusable bags are and why how is the reusable bags different than what we re already doing if we sell the if the people next year sell them at the holiday boutique then if we sell compost then it would be the same customers and if we give the customer something different more people will come because they ll yeah and they need bags they could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy and for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag they could use the reusable bag i have an idea i think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler and then we should get the bags and we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea and then they could buy the bags and they could buy the compost and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it s not that hard so we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost yeah that s what i was thinking it s gonna cost extra and then make it just a bit more expensive cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost you know if you put your money in the bank they give you money this would basically give you money because you can make the compost yeah the interest yeah so we can get the money from this and then we can buy the bags for the high level tea but that has no holes for the worms the sun is coming right into but would it fit in our room so we need to get more information on this remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size yeah but normally they don t do false advertisement this is like in a this the bottom is like this size of a desk you could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in it s like a shower it s like the size of a shower yeah you guys need more information we need more information before you can make a decision on that a lot of information on this already but we won t make tea if this one would have really worked cause it s made you know the more it costs the better it works do you agree with his comment no yeah that s what cara said can anyone give an example i don t agree with that because when i was real little i bought some toy cars and they didn t work as well as i got some that were cheaper and the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones okay you guys continue discussing that,0.0
most friends have finished their first trials i wanted to talk real quick about what s happened on your first trial who wants to share what happened on your first three trials and i want to know was it something that you predicted would happen cody at first we kinda got a little it kind of got a little complicated since you came around it fixed it a little why was it complicated cause the rest of the group didn t see your experiment why was it complicated because it keep turning and the wax paper was what kept turning the car your car kept turning yeah and the wax paper kept coming off and turning it so it was a little complicated so after you got it fixed and after i helped you then what did you find out that it was kind of easy to do so did your measurement did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be when it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance we thought it was gonna i thought it was gonna go very far because that s a little bit slicker because that it s slippery well i was listening to another group talk about something i think it was at bhavana s group raise your hand if you re in bhavana s group and really deep had really good observation because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too but you told me something about the surface that we were testing on i said the the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough so do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we re testing on being rough if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car s going to travel give me a thumb s up i think that makes a difference lucy why do you think it makes a difference the carpet there s a feel of bumps if you could feel it and the wax paper is slippery so that s how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast like if they have wheels or something it makes stuff fast that s true so as we get ready for our next test you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial but i want you to predict now that you ve kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel looking at your information your measurements i want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface and we re choosing to use the shelf liner today the black shelf liner in your tub do you think the car s going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial we may only get through one trial and that is okay alright but i want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start so lawson what are you gonna do first before you test get in a group meeting and sit down and meet yeah and talk about your predictions first that s what good scientists do they re always making really good predictions about what they ve observed alright go i m setting the timer i think it will go really bumpy well not really bumpy but a little bumpy and it might go just a little less than the smooth i think that it will go slower because the surface it s really bumpy and one time i went on this bumpy slide and i did not go down very quickly don t worry about recording the information right now but we ll record in a little bit i think they re gonna go a little bit far i bet slower hey you can t pick off of me i think that it s gonna go farther and faster i think it s gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster i think it s gonna go a little bit slower i think it s kind of gonna go since it s bumpy it s gonna slow it down i think it was gonna go farther group meeting s over so you think it s gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper no i think it s going a little bit slower but still a little fast like medium so you don t think it s gonna change that much why do you think that cause it doesn t feel too too bumpy it doesn t feel too too bumpy she s making a really good observation what do you think jaylin my predict is when you put the car on it it s gonna kinda go medium it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast and then when it gets to the carpet it s gonna go slower and then it s gonna turn it s gonna go a lot slower and then it s going to turn i think like that fast okay not too fast not as fast as the wax paper go ahead and test but let s think about your setup here before you move this let s look at your setup as the car rolls what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug what might happen it might get stopped remember the car s going to continue to move until something makes it stop so what might you want to do with your ramp we might want it to be here so it will go straighter but it might bump into the black box it may well you know the rug is going to i don t mean there but i mean i know what we could do we could do it this way so it won t crash well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way javier could you go get us some tape it may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape try it and see let s try it without some yeah it doesn t even need tape who s the task manager here me look out he s doing the first test i think it should be jaylin okay jaylin now do you test sideways we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn t agree and you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same javier can you move out of the way you ready now wait a minute wait a minute cause i bet you probably got his on tape jaylin show me how you did that again go get the car watch what he did with his popsicle stick cause i hadn t seen that before do it just like you did the first time what did he do with his popsicle stick he flipped it down do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up why might it make a difference olivia because it might when you put it down you re putting it down fast and i bet it makes the car go a little bit faster and it gives it some force did it give it more force so jaylin is this surface the same as this surface is this the same as this yes i think is this popsicle stick the same as this here no so if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy no so what do you need to do with the popsicle stick raise it up you might want to raise it up next time alright try it again i ll come back and see if you guys are ready one two and go wow that was great now let s start measuring now we re gonna start measuring okay okay one two no tessa s gotta do that one two three ready oh my gosh we were right our first prediction is one two three four five six seven eight it s eight oh my gosh why s it eight and ours keeps getting a mess up i predicted eight too see i predicted seven mostly we got eight cubes on this one eight cubes really before we clean up i would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting i m gonna come around and be watching quick quick quick it s almost time for us to go about what you learned what you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used the shelf liner what did you learn from what you tested i learned that the bumpy surface made it go that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster how do you know that because when we use the smooth it went further how far did it go it went about eight cubes no i think it actually went seven i don t know we didn t put the lines behind it 36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes so that makes it the point where bumpy is slower so 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy the shelf liner i think it was seven on the bumpy big difference isn t it is that what you predicted no i didn t predict eight i predicted 16 no i didn t predict on the bumpy but i predicted i predicted one and i got the right answer for it on smooth alright well you guys have two more trials to do so we ll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three alright go ahead and get cleaned up we already cleaned most of them first well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub you can go ahead and record your data but we re gonna get cleaned up go ahead and get cleaned up alright push the red button you can push the red button mary come over here tell us what you learned okay mary come over here i learned that different surfaces can make something different whatever you re testing make it go fast and slow mary what did you learn i learned mostly the same thing except when we did that you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet it makes this go faster than the carpet which makes a difference yeah jaylin what did you learn i learned if you put the car on this it s gonna go a little bit faster if you put it on this it s gonna go a little bit almost fast and it s gonna stop and go slower and that s why it went right there okay does anybody have anything else javier what did you learn well i learned that if it s smoother it s quicker but if it s a little bumpy it s slower that s it alright everyone put your things in the bucket,0.0
so how would you describe that can you find the exact spot where that is in the text where you can find those so you basically have found two character traits to describe to me right you guys have discovered that he can be what what was one of them again jealous sad jealous or sad so i want you to find that evidence if you want to make those claims any of those are great ideas but now you have to dig a little bit deeper into the text and see if you can find this can you find examples and see ok keep sharing you re doing a great job toby wanted to play because toby was kinda jealous because bouncer was outside by himself didn t want to nobody didn t and a little kid wanted to go outside the house well i think he s thinking this himself because he was thinking about what the other that s toby so he s kinda jealous because he s talking to the other little dog and every single time he wants to play ball with him but he doesn t want to and the thing is the lady said it in the story it made it sadder than it usually would be sad that sometimes the stories make it seem so sad so good that that can feel so here where it says why does andy need a new dog oh wait why does andy need a new dog wondered toby he already has me toby sighed and laid down beside the dog maybe andy doesn t love me anymore they had to make it so that what happened and actually it s sad what happened it s not that it s sad but it s not so so sad but they make it like sad toby wanted toby wanted to play ball and he got a new dog and forgot i was about to well he didn t really forget about toby because he still bought toby his food i know toby wanted to play ball but when andy came he got a new dog and then for the rest of the day andy was playing with his new dog and toby felt left out i say we put left out somewhere he s so sad jealous and left out so toby wanted to play ball with andy but when andy how do you spell andy a n d y andy andy where do you see oh yeah when andy told him he wanted to play ball where are you andy andy toby wanted to play ball but when andy came he had a new dog and you spelled with a silent i think with the andy another dog a new like this one another dog no it s not well whatever who wants to just write just write i put toby was jealous because of bouncer maybe we can put because he wanted more attention that s how my sister is she wants more attention we re not talking about your sister we re talking about toby so toby was jealous toby was jealous because a dog s there because toby was a dog and bouncer just came along and he didn t like him he s jealous no we have to write a reason why he s jealous i know then we have to do part of the test part of the test did you guys agree on a character trait that he was at the beginning jealous jealous jealous do you have at least one example and maybe two do you have an example joaquin i m going to put toby wanted more attention but bouncer got more attention do you have an example of why he wanted more attention i have one can you find it oscar when he was like maybe bouncer doesn t love him anymore i only said that can you find that so when you write it when you explain it can you find that part and maybe quote it there s another reason when they came through the driveway he got all and then when he came back he lay so that s like too many things toby was jealous cuz toby was jealous cuz bouncer got more attention instead of toby no yeah oh right here in the middle toby since nobody what paragraph is that paragraph nine he wondered if andy had forgotten all about him do you know why he paid more attention to bouncer because he s a little puppy and little puppies need more attention than big puppies because little puppies don t know what to do i know and they re not even trained they have to train them more for like three months yes that s why he needs more attention than bouncer yeah toby needed because toby really knows how to and he knows that s an old dog and you can see all the wrinkles that s how the dogs are yeah those dogs have wrinkles when they re big already but they re still young ok toby was jealous because bouncer what did you write so i have in the beginning was toby when andy had a puppy he liked bouncer more than toby maybe and in the beginning andy was showing the puppy opening opening the puppy and showing it to toby yes that s how he was like nervous jealous yeah jealous and selfish yeah that s what i put in the beginning and then toby remember the part when he got the little ball right yeah and he was being jealous yeah bouncer because he was a new one and the old one was toby and the part when andy closed the door in toby s face and he let him outside then he felt loner i believe that toby was getting bouncer because they would stay together and they slept the whole night together so they were being friendly yeah like starting to yeah another thing that bouncer was new and another thing toby was old so andy was used to bouncer and bouncer and toby and that s i think what toby about it s bouncer you know how the fence went to bouncer they get a kinda middle something yeah that s what i think when they started to get toby showed bouncer how to catch the ball that s when they started to become friends and the climax is when andy he throw the rubber ball and told bouncer to go and fetch it but he just sit there and then yeah then andy called toby to go and show him how to pitch the ball okay oh almost part of the end is when the puppy that is bouncer becomes crying and then andy took the puppy to toby yeah in the beginning i was getting like selfish may i interrupt for a second so you guys it looks like you ve developed the beginning pretty well and you found examples right have you talked about the ending yet and how he was at the end i see you re on the back page how does toby change at the end have you guys talked about that part yet what s his character trait at the end of the story we talked about the okay so who was working on that part was somebody working on that part yeah was there a trait that you picked for him at the end when the little puppy bouncer started crying and andy took the little puppy bouncer when toby how did toby change then how do we describe toby then happy happy yeah can you give an example of now that he s happy he s happy why because he just thinks anymore that ohhh can you come up with another reason maybe together if you guys can look for another example as to why at the end of the story toby is happy can you look and see if you can find one i think that toby in the ending is kind is kind okay can you come up with an example and share it with them in the scene and then maybe you guys can come up with a consensus on one that you agree or you can write two different things right you don t all have to write the same thing one of you can write he s kind and one of you can write he s happy as long as you have what as long as you have what your reason your reason absolutely so share that other example share that other example too i think i ve got he s kind maybe because he s going to be kind to bouncer because he s still like a little puppy and he doesn t know how to do stuff i think yeah in the end when he said for me at the end he was getting kind of happy because andy told bouncer to andy told toby to to get the yellow ball you know the yellow ball yeah and bouncer was kind of tired and everything because he s he s small and toby he catched it and they were playing yeah and they were getting happy and toby in the end at that part he was used to liking bouncer now mm hm at the climax at the climax it was when it was when toby when andy told toby to show bouncer how to fetch the ball and then started fetching the ball and then he started to play and bouncer and bouncer danced on his bed bouncer tried okay,0.0

okay what s the next one zach jen you can put on a 50 line poem on that one here if you wanted to i got that you have okay what was the main what was the summary what would be a good summary sentence well they competed in a game known as the memoriad uh huh you guys had that one don t you you have the names and faces there that was great the game are you doing the vocab though no okay so wait hang on should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words you can just do anything from that article the pictures were just to get you thinking about it that s why we did the words and the vocab was just to help us understand so it doesn t have to go off the vocab but the vocab kind of connects with an idea so it may kind of work out that way you ll have to let zach see because you took what he had which is great and you added to it do we put the name of the movie i m doing it s a song the croak part is a song mm hmm that was part of the okay i was getting there there s the song i was stuck on the reading one too got one left zach what s the text structure sharpening his pencil just go like that so was the puppet in 1970 or was it yep 1970 that must have been old 1968 is when the yellow submarine came out yep all right do you guys want to put your pyramid up there zach do you want to help do that do you agree that he was right on the text structure yeah see if you can build it i tried to size it just about right as close as i could get so it should fit in there pretty good i don t think it s sized up very well what i just got it as close as i could zach it may not be 100 perfect and then the person that didn t read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers that means we got to do another one you each got a chance to read yeah that s the tone one we need one more detail did i make it a little too big or is it pretty close it s a little long could be a little long huh had a little extra at the bottom next time i ll shrink it up just a little bit we still have one more that s fine and who read it was it zach we ll let zach read those when the girls get done okay do i read the summary do you just want me to read i don t know if he knows start with the details memoriad is an unforgettable competition memoriad games is memorize 50 line poems people compete in the games called memoriad the game is to memorize it memorize names and faces and memorize a 50 line poem very good and what was your text structure description description because they were describing all about he just talked he did the talking you did the writing somebody gave you ideas kinda maybe it was a good partnership the girls are just about done we ll let them read theirs and then we ll do our jeopardy can we tape the jeopardy game mm hmm yep we have the same people in jeopardy that were in here yes it is the same group okay let s not have a sword fight right now she has one more task there she s got it all grammatically correct okay let s just judy over here do you mind if it s off to the side there s another one there s two of them oh did it fall off well we can put a little piece of tape over it oh here it is there you go that should hold it up good all right see if you agree with what the girls have here are you listening zach got a pyramid all set up our text structure is wait do i start at the bottom start at the bottom and the details kind of add to the summary the movie they were talking about was the yellow submarine starring is it starring or staring starring i bet starring the beatles the beatles okay their song called being green was made in 1970 summary the television was made in 1953 kermit was in 1970 stoplight was made in 1920 they all had one thing in common they were in a color very good i love that last sentence they all have that in common they re in color text structure is sequence sequence because it tells the order of them all the years very good okay one of you guys go grab a marker board one from each team and i ll go get jeopardy and you ll need a marker to write on the marker board i will pull the screen down all right zach zach where are the markers you can grab one back there there s one up here as long as you got one or two for your group you can take turns now these questions i think will flow pretty well today whoa i can t even see it i think the yellow is better i know with the lights on it s a little harder but it helps to have the lights on did we run review what did we run review text structure my music didn t come on confucius says vocab text features features thank you zach yes they re different confucius says yeah okay who started first last time was it the guys yeah okay we ll let the gals start today so do i do text structure oh you re gonna win text structure 500 text structure 500 yeah what s the confucius says we had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit they were little sayings and you decide just which text structure they go with so that might go with text structure yes it ll be a text structure question yeah is that what you guys wanted was text structure right yeah okay in our state dams have been built zach on many rivers these dams are used to product electricity we need but they also create problems scoot your chair closer to your partner scoot your chair back prevents the other wildlife near the rivers therefore we should not build any more dams instead we should use solar energy or energy from the sun to produce electricity this will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us hmm which of the five text structures we think it s problem solution problem solution correct give yourself 500 points because it said problem in there all right what would the guys like hey sorry zach what do you want they did text structure 500 it ll pop up yellow after i click on the next one vocab for 500 vocab for 500 want to read that one zach you should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response hmm what does ponder mean you think ahh perfect to think about give yourself 500 points all right what would the gals like should we try the confucius question yeah for 500 okay confucius says for 500 and marissa can read this one confucius says a beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes this is one of the five text structures description yeah description description very good and i ll just set these out i got something that might help you guys since a lot of these have them you just kind of have your choices right there what would the guys like very good text features text features 500 text features 500 which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects people and places you find in a book index table of contents title what do you guys think alphabetical listing what do you think zach index index index would be correct good job guys what would the gals like oh 500 yeah i just did that 500 should we text features for 400 400 okay all right judy can read this one what text feature gives definition for vocabulary words wait what is it wait yeah what do you mean for that oh i didn t that one doesn t have the choices like the other one did it would be an index a glossary or a title glossary glossary is correct i put the choices on the other ones i just must have missed that one very good all right confucius says for 400 confucius says for 400 could you go for mrs lloyd s for just a couple minutes okay i wanna go tell mr debush that s all right i ll just get you guys a pass here in just a second we ll do a couple more questions here all right whose turn to read it s zach s zach s turn okay confucius say first feed the lion then enter cage hmm sequence sequence do you agree with him yeah yes very good sequence all right what would the gals like what one did they do they just did the confucius says for 400 i want to do that one for 400 or for 300 right i think yeah confucius says 300 okay yeah okay all right oh man basketball whose turn to read confucius says net in soccer is much larger than net in basketball compare and yeah compare and contrast very good all right so they did this one zach what would you guys like you want to do vocab for 400 vocab for 400 yeah vocab vocab for 400 okay many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs very good just a second what do you think first players okay the first players you re exactly right oh my gosh people who have done something for the first time and they don t get paid they re amateurs all right what would the gals like they did vocab structure yeah structure 400 yeah they want the big point ones is it my turn yeah i think so living in the country is very different than living in the city a city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people in the country there are fewer cars and people in the city many people can walk to the movies stores and other activities in the country people must drive to get to places compare and contrast yeah compare and contrast and she agrees very good all right what would the guys like what do you want zach vocab for 300 vocab for 300 oh it s your turn zach i depleted my savings when i bought my new basketball shoes what do you think hmm what do you think one for depleted oh i know this one drained drained yep empty gone you used all your savings and basketball shoes can cost a lot of money so i can see that happening what would the gals like confucius oh wait no no no did they do text structure 300 nope he just did the vocab okay i want to do text structure for 300 features for 300 no text structure oh text structure i can go back structure for 300 the eye is made up of many parts the white part of the eye is called the sclera sclera and the colored part is called the iris the iris comes in many colors including brown blue green and hazel the iris is covered with the cornea which is clear and round description do you agree yeah i should know about the eye because my stepmom s a she works at the eye company wait did we just pass text features oh she does they just,0.0
okay so for our first trial we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding hcl and it took 73 5 milliliters and for our second trial we had the same amount of milk of magnesia but this time we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water and it took less hcl hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did and the first time we only added five drops of phenylthalene and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different and the ten drops definitely made it pinker but we don t think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator and not part of the reaction you guys actually brought up a good point how many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities how many think that you didn t add enough let s just ask that or how would you know if you added too much or not enough alright go ahead will well as long as it turns pink you know that the indicator s working what if it s pinker it wouldn t matter because it turns clear towards the end what do other people think alright vivian i feel like if there s not enough indicator that when you add more and more hcl to the solution it becomes the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink so i don t think there s such a thing as adding too much indicator our group added about five drops and that was enough okay what tad actually adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants so in an extreme case if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator that would definitely distort the concentration true what do people think about that alright jimmy the indicator doesn t participate in the overall reaction so it doesn t really make a difference what do people have to say to that alright why don t you take discuss would adding too much indicator would that affect your concentration like in terms of volume maybe you re adding to more volume of your reaction would that affect the concentrations of your reactants okay thoughts alright jerry i feel like if you added the indicator it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water if you added let s say would change the concentration okay alright stephanie i think it would like because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia even if you add a lot of phenylthalene it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that s what s reacting so i don t think it affects it alright mackenzie isn t ph determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions so if it s it would be moles over liters so if there were more liters it would be a smaller concentration right alright corey it s mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine they will neutralize it doesn t really matter the over liters as long as the moles are equal okay rick well since phenylthalene is an indicator it doesn t actually participate in the reaction just like water so adding it would just increase the volume which as he said which would dilute the solution adding a lot would have a profound affect but adding a little bit wouldn t actually make a difference okay richard it would because there s a lower concentration it would take a lot longer for it to react meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error because when you re using a burette it s continuously dripping so then if you re swirling and it doesn t react as fast then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it so those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with and all reasonable it does affect the concentration and when you add a few drops just like vivian said if you don t add enough then it s still indicating but in terms of the overall concentration the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small and so that s why you see like a very faint pink but it s still indicating now if you add more drops of course you re going to have a darker pink but the overall reaction volume would increase and so if you add drops of phenylthalene if you re adding like five drops compared to your overall reaction volume it wouldn t be that big of a difference so you would still have some source of error but since you re only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected you know it would make it so it s more diluted okay does that make sense to everyone alright those were all good comments anyone else have a comment alright so let s go to table two in last week s experiment we were testing how much hcl it would take to neutralize 25 ml of milk of magnesia first we measured 25 ml of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask then we slowly used the burette to drop the hcl into the flask and it took us 55 5 ml of hcl to clear the solution every time we d see that it s clear it took the solution longer time so the first time we stopped putting we stopped adding hcl but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink but then after the third or fourth stop that we made it took longer than one second so by the time it took so like towards the end it didn t turn pink anymore so for the second trial what we did instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia we just used 15 milliliters and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there s a change in the amount of hcl we used and it did because it took a lot less which was 35 5 milliliters of hcl as compared to the first trial where we used 55 5 so we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one it was roughly 35 5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m o m to come clear as over hcl and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn t expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once do you think you did something wrong well we kind of did but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear did anyone else did any other groups think that when the reaction was happening that you had done something wrong or were surprised by the results alright ian oh no just saying yes okay anyone have a comment we thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of hcl for the indicator to start working what do you mean start working to start turning opaque because it was pink for a long time we had to add extra hcl to the burette we actually thought that it wouldn t stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times stopped the burette from running and every time it kept changing color so we thought that happened throughout the experiment did you think it was going to go on forever yep okay any other groups alright andrew we noticed that yeah what they said it changed to clear and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink we thought it was the reversible reaction rates but then like we were surprised at how big a difference it was because it was really clear when we were stirring it but once we stopped became really pink okay alright will there was also a transitional phase where it turned light and we thought that was the phase it would turn into rather than clear so we actually stopped it there but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear so we started adding more okay alright group three first we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene it took about 7 milliliters of one molar hcl to actually fully huh yeah it took 70 milliliters and then it stayed clear from there for the second trial we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia would it would the time decrease i mean the time to neutralize decrease and so we add 15 ml of magnesia and the same amount of h2o and so we used up about so i heard something about timing because i heard the first couple groups timed some of the things what did you guys time and why did you choose to time that here let s start here because you guys timed something what did you time and why did you choose to time that well basically i think we re just measuring the amount of hcl we used up and see how many times we need to stop the burette for well we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more hcl we put the faster it was from the switch so we kept adding hcl and it turned all clear it turned all clear the faster the previous times were milky white and then towards the end it becomes clear like totally clear okay did anyone observe something different in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink okay table six as we added more hcl the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink okay so yeah rick i don t think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added rather than the time you left it in there so if you add more of course it s going to change quicker but it doesn t matter like how long you have to wait for so you guys were saying that when you added the hcl that it changed quicker to white and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink okay gabriel we timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore it will take a long time to get back to the reactions right back to the products which turns it to pink okay alright corey i was saying that it was faster turning back to pink the reaction was actually it was slower going back to pink that s okay okay let s go to table four in our experiment in our procedure actually we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide and one beaker we would heat instead of diluting it we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees celsius and we would perform the experiment with adding hcl using the burette and in the other beaker we would leave it in room temperature which is around 25 degrees celsius and we would do the same procedure adding the hcl with the burette our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction what we found was that when we heated it it actually changing from pink to clear it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature so we don t know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it ll react faster we also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did so that may have skewed our answers a little as well it took us a lot longer and more hcl to turn the solution clear again comments does anyone think that so this group didn t dilute how many groups diluted and added distilled water okay so all the other groups did do you think that their data would be affected because they didn t dilute and because you did what are your thoughts alright nina we diluted our second trial and it didn t affect the amount of hcl needed why do you think well from your observations that s obvious but does anyone know why or think why that might happen why would your data not be affected or think that maybe theirs was a fluke and your data should have been affected by diluting it with water alright joey is it because the hcl only reacts with the milk of magnesia so it doesn t affect how much water because it doesn t react with water okay what do you guys think alright katie i think it will affect it because the concentration s higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there s less surface area i would say okay less surface area okay that s a possibility alright gabriel i think it wouldn t affect the amount of hcl that would be added but it will just affect the time because with water it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there s more volume and without diluting it their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink and then at the end it will just turn clear either way why do you think it would be faster if they didn t dilute it because there would be less volume and the smaller the spaces the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around okay reasonable yep so our group kind of did both we had a control we redid the same experiment for number one and then we measured how many milliliters of hcl it took so if you change the concentration it does affect the amount of hcl it takes to neutralize it alright michael we diluted it and it took longer for us to we added more hcl for it to neutralize and i feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia there would be less molarity and if it s not diluted it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted it would become weaker you can t change the strength of an acid or a base because it s based on what it s by definition you can t make a strong base weak but that s okay wintel in our case we did two solutions different concentration the amount of hcl that s needed to neutralize the solution shouldn t be should be the same but in this case the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more hcl because during the delay the reaction the hcl hasn t still reacted with milk of magnesia yet and because of that delay there s more hcl that s needed to compensate for that okay so there s a little bit of stoichiometry going on where the number of moles or the amount the amount s still the same regardless of whether of milk of magnesia regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn t so the amount s still the same,0.0
oh water or more i guess and what gets thrown into the pond the pebble is there a pebble oh that s so cute okay so wait what order these do these rings show up what order yeah like what s the procedure when this was like like this and then this one or then this one they start small and bigger and bigger so drop your pebble in the pond there you go and it gets bigger as it goes up okay and so now maybe talk through maybe talk through what is the given what s the constant rate of change where you re looking for it and how would that be seen visually so the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second per second the adt is two pi r br the first which one are you guys on number one okay good in order for you to find for qr may define the adt we need to find the adt of different orbs what the adt concentrating with them so it s like four for dr okay so what did you do with your sand show me what happened here okay air is gonna come into the clear hole and then right into you picked the sand problem tell me about your sand problem it s talking about sand quality to a how to apply it at a rate to be permanent okay and out of the following the diameter of the base in it is it s going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot that s the idea and the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from okay so our cone has been smooshed but you see how it s still kinda narrow a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone right and what s the unknown what are we looking for here we re trying to find the rate of the height of the pile oh you can do it we said that s possible okay so kathy you re able would that be dvdt dhdt drdt all these dts we can kinda run together just blow it up can we do ahdt sure ahdt because you re looking for a rate of change for the height now you re actually on the hardest problem this is the trickiest problem and you have correctly chosen the cards for these but here s what makes it tricky i want you to read through this slowly and let s figure out the unknown and if they give us what other rates they give us now you actually just told me what the unknown is right dhdt dhdt okay what other variables do we have on this card besides dhdt and the rate of change ar ardt ardt and dvdt okay now you read it again while y all are listening and see if you can pick out maybe do dvdt or drdt what was that for both at a sand and gravel plant sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of plus what information did you just get you can say it again if you need to sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute okay good that s dvdt cause it s the amount the volume changes and the label kinda gets screwy too right okay so now we re listening for drdt we hope we hear drdt because we need that also right the diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude so okay so it s giving us information about radius compared to altitude but it doesn t seem to be giving us drdt right which means we don t have drdt and the radius is two feet and the radius is two feet so what s the height again it s the height of dt so we need to find how fast the radius is changing so this right here is the decision nice the dvdt equals four pi r squared to the drdt so this is the hardest when you get to the math what we need to find is drdt when the radius equals two feet okay all right okay i guess the next one we can figure out right now how many cubes we got three three okay all the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second how fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter we have you doing the edges of a cube the radius of an aired balloon so the radius one 370 370 370 so d ds over dt is three right plug that we can just plug that in cause it s not a constant tell me a little bit about the problem you re on does it have three cubes in your problem like why does it have three cubes in the box we started with that this other one okay and it shows after a second it would be that big and then after another second it would be that big oh good okay so it s showing that it s the same cube and it s getting bigger it s like three stages in an environment very good very good correct interpretation yes and it also shows the volume of the now what does this question ask you for at the very end what are you gonna be trying to find how fast the volume changes when it enters from yes i have a question for you here s a think about it question cause you re finding dvdt when it is exactly one centimeter right that s what the question s asking do you think dvdt would be greater or smaller when it s past one centimeter do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster or will it slow down slow down slow down slow down my challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with try two centimeters and see if you were right yeah so go above and beyond the question was your conjecture right or were you like oh no we were backwards kay okay the base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball at a descending rate and it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part oh you look great d two so okay let s pour the sand again so what five so it s pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute talking about the change in output so what s constant its cubic feet per minute so that s the the sand being poured in it so that s the volume i don t know okay we have choices as to who can t i have four and zero to bring it down yeah i m just gonna bring it down problem number what problem one okay next problem are we agreed a ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house the base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second how fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall so then you definitely got the demonstration item perfect that s right that s exactly what s happening all right okay you guys are gonna get this one it s what s supposed to be a length and what made you pick that one it s the pythagorean theorem and then why would you wanna use the pythagorean theorem because it s a three sided it s equal to the right triangle yeah exactly uh huh all right okay now i ve got a question for ya is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning okay good good all right what would that mean about your derivative card what would you know for sure if you put 25 right there get a constant rate of one foot per second anything special for this derivative card dz over dt equals well if the original if your ladder is 25 right here where would the 25 originally be put in the z in the z okay i that would say that x squared plus y squared equals 25 now take the derivative of this with respect to time would it look exactly like this or a little bit different one we re at a constant rate right and so when you do your math you can go ahead and put that as zero and then just work with those good that s good so what s the the balloon s increasing yeah following the radius it s the what s the radius it s four feet the radius yeah you have to find what the radius is at four feet and find the radius when it s at four feet which one are you on p two when the radius is four feet at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area so you would define the area wait which are you on okay so you have three balloons right and you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what okay okay the rate of change so if you have one balloon and put one back into it and then that s when you have okay let s see what they look like so let s see if we can have different stages of our balloon here you look like you must be at the last stage cause that looks pretty big okay that must be the beginning that looks like the beginning too can one of em get middle stage i think you ve got the baby balloon though i think that s the biggest that guy s getting i didn t know they were different sizes yeah they are actually different sizes one more do it and you let some out maybe you got it oh perfect okay tell me about what s going on with this balloon what s goin on oh increase four cubic feet and they oh what are they i think i m thinking of the wrong one like it s not like it s not measuring each breath it s something no you are thinking right this is is this like what we had two days ago yeah a couple days ago like is what was constant a couple days ago in our activity air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of yes so like the volume the rate of change of volume is constant is that true on this or is that a different problem okay and so what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out the change of the radius how the radius is and what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets it ll stretch out that i m sorry it ll slow down yeah i think that s a good conjecture that would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got sounds good and it is because it was what the volume cause the volume yeah f four for that that ll go on the left f four and d six have you gotten to the balloon part yet let s talk about the other one okay one okay the other balloon problem was about surface area is that right have you done this one yet yes okay how many blow up the balloon and let s see what s happening in that balloon kevin what was happening on this balloon it s the rate of the the puddle b a formula problem okay so how is jesse gonna show us the surface area of dvdt okay so let s demo that causing ripples thank you nice demonstration what is constant on this problem the area and then yeah the radius,0.0
so can you record two on that it s harder to write two remember here you can use your number line if you need it to help you do you want me to turn it so there s the two can you try to write it i did it awesome that looks like a two so was this awesome all right or super bad super bad super bad why do you think it was super bad because it s not heavy because it s not heavy okay julia what s our second problem ow the styrofoam ball the styrofoam ball can you find the styrofoam ball yes that one we can first we re gonna make this one is bigger how does it feel though is it round it does we re gonna be answering questions over here julia can you let make his prediction which one did you pick that one you picked all right why did you pick all right because it s little how does it feel feel it no it s not heavy what do you think is there anything that you re wondering about that what s next what do you think all right again you think all right too mark them all right you think awesome you think it s gonna go 15 or more okay let s see are you ready can you pick up the tape and do it again gonna get the tape you re supposed to do it again because there s another space yep we re gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time okay put it this way ivan s gonna put it in is everyone ready oh wait you have to keep it upside down so it can push okay can you try it over ivan are you ready let s try one more time i m gonna put this cup right in front one more time well feel it is it heavy that s okay i m gonna be right back has anything surprised you so far what happened the orange ball so what kind of push was it an awesome an awesome push so did that surprise you you didn t think it was gonna go so far i though it was gonna go like is that where the tape went so you guys can pick up the tape should we do the green ball the green ball which ball so far a zero a zero and it didn t move at all yes why do you think it didn t move because it s so tiny it s so tiny but does it weigh a lot no no it didn t do you think that s why it didn t go far and it s so tiny and it doesn t have more mass ahh i see so should we do this again yeah the super bad is actually this one right here oh it s so tiny so feel it how does it feel let luka feel it how does it feel so jacob why don t you make your prediction from all right to super bad what do you think sofia what did you put why did you put all right so right there how far do you think it s gonna go what did you put sofia sofia picked luka what do you think which one do you think what s it gonna be awesome all right or super bad good pick all right so we re gonna do it down here on this one all right are you ready make your prediction and then we re gonna put it on the ground what do you think awesome all right or super bad who picked awesome sofia right do you guys have anything that you re remember when we were i do remember when we were trying to what did we find out what is it what do you think for the second ball you think a rock is inside maybe if they were rocks then they would be so hard that s true is it really hard a little a little bit hard what do you think is inside can we find out we can open one of these probably let s put it down first everybody write it jacob are you the recorder what are you the counselor are you the starter okay guys is everyone ready you know what we re gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup we can move the tape now sofia we need you to count move the cup over how far did it go one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 will you count again with me ready one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 jacob this went 10 can you write 10 down no for the super bad it went 10 yep it s super awesome so what do you think where did it go was it awesome all right or super bad awesome all right it was all right why was it all right and is 10 more or less than 15 less than 15 so that s why it s all right okay guys i m gonna go to the next group now what you re gonna do is trial two you re gonna do every ball one more time okay yep we re gonna do it one more time okay i will be right back how s it going over here has anything surprised you what surprised you which ball didn t push it very far wait how far did it actually push so that means that the cup didn t move at all why do you think the cup didn t move because it s so light which one moved the farthest so far which ball the orange one is the orange ball really light how does the orange one feel like it has more mass is there anything you guys are wondering about if they re bouncy let s put this ball back does that one bounce i wonder why not okay so what are we putting next on your sheet what should you do are you putting the rubber ball yeah are you guys all putting that you think it s gonna be an awesome push ready put tape here alexandra are you the taper it s on the wrong side no she got it she did it so move the cup over now nicholas is gonna count one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 can you help write in 13 yeah this one right here has a one and a three can you try writing that it s gonna have one more it s gonna have one more so if the styrofoam ball went zero and the orange ball went 13 which one is more 13 how do you know that you just know that when you count does it come higher yes it does okay ivan s ball is next we need to do a trial shoot of which one okay you have a red yeah mine what do you guys think about this ball it s awesome it s awesome why is it awesome it s awesome because it s red and it s the cardinals color well i would love for you to come should we see how far it goes all right let s check it it knocked the cup over let s try one more time it knocked it over again we re gonna put the tape here do you think that was farther than the rubber ball but when the ball goes farther seven eight nine 10 11 what can you find it on the number line where s 11 uh huh that s what it looks like is 11 more or less than 13 is it more than 13 or less which one is what more than is more than 11 if you look on the number line so you re right 13 is more yeah yeah okay you guys can start putting the balls away,0.0
how do you know how do you think it might be different okay maybe ethan goes here measure yours and let s see and which one do you think you re going under i don t know okay all right okay well you all listen to him listen to him you all talk about it you talk to them i m gonna walk around it s my turn ej okay let him do the writing why are you taking them out of that one okay and what are you trying to make it do balance okay balance let s see you trying to make it balance okay we need to put it right there okay did you balance it now okay so what do put in that point i m going to scoot this just a little it and then you write it down good how did you know it was balanced good you said which one was heavier here okay why did you say think you can do that one how did you know it was balanced is it balanced what about that at first which one was balanced because why it was heavy okay okay so how many of those are i think it was one more okay you re put it in you ll put what in this one and the number of crayons you all used you had another object that was moving look right here you think their eraser didn t move what you all gonna test next did you even measure that one and i ll come back alright what are you all doing here do you think if you did the scissors and matthew did the scissors do you think it would measure the same let s do it okay let s do it one at a time what s happening you guys can t measure try this one here s my question if matthew blows the paper clip is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip what do you think you don t think so why not matthew you blow okay all right so remember that okay now weslee i want you to test it you said you thought it would go different see if you can make a difference yeah why did it do something different what s that that you re blowing out air air and what is it gas gas good all right you all can go ahead and finish measuring i saw ella trying now if you and ella both try to blow on that do you think it s going to move why don t you think it s going to move you think it s too heavy and you don t have enough breath try it and see see if you all both do it if you can get it to move you re going red in the face and it s going away did you all think it was going to move you all didn t think it was how did you find this what d you do counted okay counted and what are you working on right now the colors okay which one do you have to count now which one do you have there this one and what is that one what is that one a solid a liquid or the gas solid a solid how are you going to find out what are you gonna do look at this you re going to look at those can you count those i m gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph okay you re doing good okay okay can you come over here and count you might have to get out of your chair you have lots of them one two three four five six seven eight eight five six seven eight check your numbers and you checked to make sure all right whatcha going to do now tally tally them okay think you all can do that okay you need help putting it on remember which one is the total how did you know that so quick i heard you started counting and then what did you do you found it quickly you remembered from that okay how else could have known that fast go down there go down there okay good,0.0
what it s a dark color so what does that mean we think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster keegan how are you going to figure out how much it weighs maybe it will melt faster because the water what about that explain your thinking because you ve stolen her even now we got to count it one two no now you re taking them all three we got to count four five six here seven eight nine 10 11 12 freeze for just one second let s switch and have the boys keep on you stopped at 20 boys finish counting they stopped at 20 finish counting 21 22 23 24 but they re not counting they re just putting it in it s not working they re just putting it in in the same time so freeze gentlemen so how do you think you could fix that put it back in you might want to try to remeasure definitely want to miss t look guys we need to take a bunch of it out because it s not really getting weighed you might need to use something heavier oh remember you re not supposed to touch that nob on the back that s not how you how would you figure out how to weigh it what happened what s going on daniel tell me what the problem is it has too much oh sorry it has too much water in it yeah well can we change that scientists no what can we change we can take out a lot it s too heavy it was reaching on that side six halves this is heavier wait say that again brayden what did i just hear you say i said it s heavier this is heavier than the blocks so we put more in oh yeah we re going to put more in oh way too much way too much whoa look uh uh ms teacher ms t i think it s six and a half what is six and a half the measure oh is that your predication that s your what that s my hypothesis oh how are you going to find out if it s true what do we do can you maybe explain to teagan what she needs to do just balance it they re like working on it there we go got it got it daniel what were you saying we were going to like we just figured out how much blocks it weighs hang on it ll get there so what did you discover we discovered we had we discovered we had to take we had to take one two three four of the blocks out five five of the blocks out to make it weigh so how much does it weigh so let me count the blocks one two three four do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn t fall five six seven eight nine ten how many does it weigh okay i ll start wearing this i mean i ll start writing it no i got it what are you doing there abigail well i m weighing and it s not showing up yet what are you using that tool for what tool this tool to see how cold it is so did you already weigh it we have to hold it from the top oh so do you think it s going to weigh more now that you taped that to it what s your prediction with that do you have a prediction i have a prediction that it might be really cold and that s going to tell you that but have you weighed yours yet no and it s going to turn to ice so but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it ll change how much it weighs i think it will actually change how much it weighs can you explain your thinking because because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much one pound it was so we should probably get the thermometer one pound so we can so we can so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on my hypothesis is it s going to be 20 degrees my hypothesis is this is going to change it because it s only one pound oh so what are you going to do to test that weigh it okay put it here put it here oh are you guys discussing what are you guys discussing where we are going to put our balloons so first talk to me about your balloon why did you choose this color because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster we will think it will melt slower we think it will melt slower why because because it s a light color the sun is attracted to the dark colors so that s why we picked pink so what are you doing right now doing a hypothesis oh can you explain what s your hypothesis teagan it will be warm because we re going to put it next to the heater that s what i was going to say too and so what s your hypothesis how will that change the balloon because maybe you said we re going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we ll put it in the heater and we think it ll melt faster okay what about us it s almost in the middle take out one more now i m going to count what were you guys just doing down there she was thinking about the weight what does that mean like in the middle okay so how will you figure out how much it weighs we need to take this out and we ll count them and then we ll write it on the paper 32 32 12 13 14 brayden brayden hi hayden is there any group that s measuring the length of their s 28 29 30 31 32 almost there 43 44 45 46 47 it s there it s there what does that mean so it means that they weigh the same thing okay now we have to count them let s let will only do it two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 64 64 teagan be working in your group 23 24 25 i measured my balloon by using tiles like tiles when i measured it tiles what should we do now mrs t my balloon is filled with matter why do you say that because everything is matter well there s water inside the balloon so it s like solid and liquid why is it solid and liquid what were you saying what were you saying no keep explaining your thinking i have a question one second water is a liquid and pushes on the weight oh so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis light turns into water solids and liquids my hypothesis is my hypothesis is if we like if we if we lose the like point it will not melt faster why it s a darker color and when you think about it dark colors will melt faster on their own is that cubes the has the cubes no that s the weight pass it on have you all measured yours yet yes how d you measure it with the tape thingy would you mind showing me what you decide to do my hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we re putting it by the sun did you make a hypothesis by the length of it no ours was six and a half inches how do you know because we measured it with the measuring tape can you show me how you did it oh there s an extra one will did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now these have bigger numbers you know so what are you thinking there abigail i m thinking that not really but what were you saying there with the bigger numbers i didn t understand you held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers i mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell 30 30 30 he should start now so how big is your balloon we got to start at one oh why did you change it julia from your first measurement because we accidentally started from the 30 oh and now we have it upside down okay you got it it was it is move your finger for me it is now let s send this back here okay i think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off yeah yeah i ll hold the thermometer i m trying to take it off my hypothesis is it s going to be warm but then not attracted to the light cold water is in there because sunlight can only make warmth right,0.0
anybody tell me how much cases usually run at radio shack they re 30 dollars okay you know what so we ll factor that in in a minute but alex you had your hand raised so i d like to hear from you i was just gonna say that the 199 tax is gonna come in anyway so what if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping okay hold up cynthia but even though even though if you use 12 you re only gonna have a couple dollars left over with the economy these days things are not cheap so you can t buy something with five dollars you re not gonna get a case for that cheap that s probably right i m gonna hear two more of you and then i have something i wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about and i think is really important to point out so i wanna hear what you two have to say and then i m gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned go ahead it s better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to then you d still have zero dollars left but it s better to have equal or more money okay that s you know i think you re right that seems like it just makes sense right and one more yeah actually when i bought my phone i got a case just for about five dollars on ebay ebay so you got a used one and it paid for shipping so i didn t yes i did okay well you know what i wanna talk about that because that s actually what you guys just said is really important and several of you others mentioned it maybe we don t want maybe i don t want to have the exactly the price maybe i want to have at least and if i say i wanna have at least 200 dollars is there a way to say at least with math symbols to make that equation change so it says least cause right now it says equal is there a way to do it so it says at least colin if you you need to get the iphone and the case in the same shipping order or else it s gonna cost more for shipping oh okay so yeah i need at least a certain amount yeah so you re gonna wanna jump in on that guys you need to put the greater than or equal to sign but what does that look like the greater than sign with a line under it okay and what s the word in english that we have for that symbol yeah say it again alexis that least it is so now how much do i need to save to get at least 200 dollars right so it s okay if i have exactly or more than so that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about maybe i need more money if she wants more more than just a phone i m sure she does right with the what about the just come with the phone just that or does it come with something else like a charger battery or even a case itself so again you re saying i need at least 200 dollars right depending on what comes with the phone like a christmas special like half off or something what you can also think is where you gonna buy it and where is there s no tax and stuff so it depends on where you re gonna buy it if you want no tax that means like on ebay or something but it might be 50 percent off and stuff like that okay interesting i m just saying it depends where you re gonna buy your phone okay no i like that a lot when i was doing my equation i got 121 so you would still have a dollar left over and you know how cassidy said that she can get it on ebay that much most people they i understand that it s cheap and most people want it like that but i bought stuff off the line before and some of the stuff does work good and some of em you drop them and it breaks so it s not always good somethin to pay attention to all right i m gonna change the conversation a little bit because i think you guys are doing really really well let s go with what you guys said and say i need at least 200 dollars if that s true is there any way to find out or to answer the original question which nick brought up how much money do i need to save each day based on what we have so far where do i go from here there is a way to solve it you grab 200 dollars and then you subtract 80 from it okay i m gonna stop you right there i don t mean to interrupt katherine you re watching this and i saw your paper what do you think about what najeem just said like okay and why is that i don t know that s how you solve it in equality okay so can you repeat what you said you subtract 80 from both sides okay i m gonna go ahead and do that right now and what does that leave us with 120 and you know what i have a question what does that 120 represent i mean if 200 is how much the phone costs what s 120 about i m not sure how much you need to raise until then okay okay and nayanna can you comment on what you think might be the next step divide 12 from 120 again divide 12 from 120 okay and somebody else jump in the answer was the answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10 okay and katie you were ready to say something what would you say i was about to say equals 10 x equals 10 and x equals at least 10 oh it was so you re not liking what i wrote over here alexis at least cause you have to keep the all the way down okay katherine what do you think i agree with alexis because it can t just like change because when you say it can t change what do you mean the side oh okay that s good i didn t know what it was i m just asking and then you have to put what x means oh oh oh so what is the label what are the units we re talkin about ah the blue tooth if you wanna have a little extra money you could have more and plus if you get a little extra money one day but you have the same another and you get a little less the next day you could raise up for another day oh like if i m going to collect cans and i don t collect as many cans one day but i collect extra the next day yeah like that nayanna you had your hand raised when you have to add 40 to 200 for the bluetooth ah that s an interesting idea so maybe we so tell me what to write instead of this how would you change this to incorporate what you just said 80 plus x equals 240 okay are you pleased are you okay with that i disagree cynthia i disagree with your answer on that one i don t agree that it s 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money you would you should you should do 11 for a day because if you do you ll get 132 and then you ll have extra money okay but that s the problem what do you mean when you say it s not asking well it s not asking for extra money or anything it s just asking how many how much money you need per day anthony i noticed you ve got some stuff written down what do you think about i wanna go back to what nayanna said she says she s gonna change the equation here and she put 240 up there why why did she do that and do you agree with that yeah cause then you would have a little extra money left a little bit you would have a little bit of extra money left okay like the bluetooth in the case maybe okay isn t this another problem another problem not a part of this one yet yeah cause they re not asking how much extra money do you need this problem this question s not asking how much extra do you need for a bluetooth also okay how much are the phone and bluetooth it s just asking for the phone okay i think because the question wasn t asking to bring extra money into it we just brought the extra money to round the make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay but we shouldn t change the equation cause it s not asking you to okay this question isn t saying anything about case or a bluetooth yet it s a yes question and this question talks about bluetooth okay so what i kinda like is you guys were doin this problem and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem which is no problem at all let s jump ahead just for a minute and assume that i did want to get the bluetooth would this be the equation to represent and before i answer this question what i would like to do i m gonna call on olivia and then i m gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co pilots and the pilots come up but not yet let s hear what olivia has to say would it be equals 12 x if you wanted to get it before christmas or would it be after one more time i could barely hear ya would we still get that before christmas or would it be after before before so would it be 12 comments on that i agree with that thumbs up if you think 12 thumbs down if you think no we don t need 12 on this one okay adrian you have something we need to know how much money you earned each day well that s what do you guys think about that question well that s what we re finding out right now i know but how much you earn that s how much he has to save pilots switch with somebody in the back all right here we go so now i have a question for you can everybody turn around for just a minute please thank you question for you if i wanted to graph our first solution on a number line what might that graph look like so will you guys agree that okay we need to earn a minimum amount and at least 10 dollars a day but if i wanted to graph that put that on a number line represent that graphically what would that look like it would be like a it would be but the circle what kind of circle i didn t hear you shaded so you want to put this up here yeah amarra i d like to hear your opinion on that i don t i never understood the shaded thing i don t know why it s shaded it s shaded because it s not i think if it s not shaded it means greater than i mean greater or less than but when it s shaded i think it means equal to or less than or with okay tara do you wanna contribute to that well whenever it says greater than or equal to the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to or greater than which is over 10 but greater than or less than can t be that number so it has to be open circle and than greater than or equal to anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle unshaded circle in real life what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle go ahead al fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils a little louder i got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils so in that problem could 14 students have mechanical pencils if you have fewer than 14 no so that would be unshaded cause 14 doesn t count so in this question amarra the least number of money i should save per day is how much i think 10 is a good answer because it does go into the number and so would be shaded or unshaded shaded oh is that the only number amount of money i should save each day is that it are their other possibilities out yeah you could do,0.0
