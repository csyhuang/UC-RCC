 Write at the top of your paper The color that you want for your sugar and the color you want for your salt on both of them Sugar on one salt on the other Yes because you can make from your sheet two Now the purpose of these sheets is so you can actually take your spoon Malik take your spoon and dip out onto that paper This gives you a better visual of how much sugar and how much salt is in that particular food Now what s the most important thing about the label Serving Size Serving size Good Aaron serving size So that is showing most of these is the container itself That s the reason we went to snack foods so that you could see how much that is This also gives you a better idea of how much you eat Some of you like Aaron may eat two or three of these especially if it was Gummies right Aaron Yes It s not Gummies but it s close Okay so any questions before you get started Okay decide who is going to do calculations decide who s going to measure first I want you to rotate those responsibilities around and Devon what is your question Remember the personal column is how much you would eat the serving size Doesn t matter your group remember has to cooperate figure out who s going to do what and just look at responsibilities Just make sure everyone sees how much sugar how much salt it is That s the important part On the back of your paper When it says about 29 grams right here What s the serving size Serving size is here there are four servings in here They would eat half the bag then it would be two servings So next is the total calories and it s got 130 calories total carbs ok so nine grams Now when you dip out your salt and sugar try to replace it in the correct bucket we don t want the salt in the sugar or the sugar in the salt So pay attention to what you re doing Now remember you have to calculate what you would eat Give me some sugar 11 grams divided by four Put two teaspoons on here Is it sodium Dip it out you see how much See visually how much it is I don t have any salt Yes Paul I want to encourage you that after you done something that s really sugary do something that you would think would be salty as if it surprises you how much sugars in it

 Okay guys good morning and welcome to class today We re going to continue our discussion on energy but we re going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven t talked about yet So what I d like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea the big idea for just a moment So the big idea that we re going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table So everybody s got their little stretchy lizard Without shooting them we re not doing anything with them yet I d like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea I m going to give you and then we ll just go around and see what you think Okay so 30 seconds to think about what s the big idea Do you know who your spokesperson is going to be Alright guys it s been 30 seconds I m going to go to each table If you could just have your spokesperson ready you could just tell me what your big idea is We re going to put it up here and we re going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we ve done Alright so how about we ll start with you guys back here since there s just two of you Alright what do you think Shawn are you going to speak The sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table Okay so the sun might warm up the lizard I just put L for lizard that s alright and make it go across the table Robert how about your table who s your spokesperson going to be The energy from the sun once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy Okay the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard Right is that okay Who s your spokesperson We said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table Okay so it might make it melt and sticky and that ll make it shoot across the table Is that what you said Alright Kendrick who s your spokesperson going to be Blaire It was unanimous Alright Blaire what do you guys have We were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going Is going to do what Like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it s going to make it jump Okay Shine and make it jump Nicole did you guys decide who your spokesperson s going to be Arrington Arrington The sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling Okay so the sun gives energy and I didn t hear the last part You want to tell me That helps it That helps it okay And last but not least Jada We think that the sun give heat to the and make it more elastic so it would stretch Okay so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic I m sorry what was the last part again Like make it more elastic so it will stretch more So it ll stretch farther good Alright so what I d like to do now is I d like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy So if I call your number I would like you to think about what do you know about let s start with potential energy What do you know about potential energy So if I call your number just tell me one factor one thing that you know about it or an example of it Alright we ll start with 15 When an object is like still it doesn t move it s holding it in Okay still doesn t move it s holding it in How about number eight Robert Something you know about potential energy or an example of it The lizards Alright very good When the lizard is still When it s moving what do you think Still Alright very good It s stored energy Alright it s stored energy and I ll do one more number two Potential energy An example or something that you remember about it The pencil is still The pencil is still Alright very good Now I know we haven t talked about these topics too much yet but I know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it Okay the next thing I d like to know is what do you know what examples do you have what can you remember about kinetic energy So we talked about potential Now I d like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy Alright so if I call your number let me know what you think Number 20 A car moving A car moving Alright number 13 A paint can being dropped A paint can being dropped alright very good Number 14 When you push a pencil and it rolls Alright when you push a pencil and it rolls very good And how about number seven we ll do one more Like the energy of motion like the The energy of motion Yeah Thanks Alright and if I didn t call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic Anybody have anything else to add about it Dylan Kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling Alright very good and that s a great way to start into the next part what we re going to use the lizards for today Alright so what I would like to know from you guys is everybody has a bucket on their table right Um hum yeah Teacher Okay And you can raise your hand for this part how can you from your seat how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket Anthony Shoot it You can shoot it You can just toss it in You can just toss it in there You could pull its tail You could pull its tail and stretch it You could drop it in there You could just drop it in there It s not too far away Anybody else Okay how about and I m not asking for a demonstration yet we ll get to demonstration I promise How about if I asked you guys instead of in the bucket at your table how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor s table At your neighbor s table Javious what do you think You could toss it You could toss it Arrington You could sling it You could sling it Wilson That was your idea Alright Walk over there and put it in it Yeah that s true I didn t say you had to stay in your seat did I You could walk over there and just put it in Gavin You could like throw it You might throw it Is that what you were going to say Dana Alright Shoot it You could shoot it alright very good You could bend it back Yep you could bend it back and shoot very good How about if I asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other Jade I ll start with you Sling it You could sling it Lewis Like you said you could shoot it Yeah you could shoot it Anthony You could throw it You could throw it So we re kind of hearing the same things right We re kind of hearing Go ahead You could walk over and drop it You could walk over and drop it I didn t say you had to stay in your seat Alright What would be the difference though between the bucket at your table the bucket your neighbor s table shooting it across the room going out on the football field and going for distance What would be the difference between what you did What difference would you have between this bucket here the bucket at your neighbor s table and so forth John what do you think The amount of energy you re putting into it Can you just show me without actually shooting it for example Like if you re trying to get it into this bucket I only have to go like this or drop it in there If I were trying to send it across the room I d have to really stretch it out Okay The distance away from the bucket Okay so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance Stretch it more I might stretch it further is that what you two were going to say The more potential energy or kinetic energy it has The more potential energy the more kinetic energy it has So when you talk about the lizard what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has How s it getting potential energy What does that mean Before you sling it it s just sitting there Alright so when it s just sitting there it s potential What about when you stretch it what do you think that is Kinetic Okay have you let it go yet No Alright so we ll think about that for a little bit What I d like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table or if you don t like what they have to say you can think about it on your own I d like for you to make a hypothesis and I d like for your hypothesis to start with I think and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor s table What do you think you would do differently I think if I do what to the lizard it s going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table So make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one By slinging it Yeah talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think Alright I ll give you But then compare it to the next table as well What would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one That s what I want you to do Okay alright So let me just have Let s hear one table Gavin I kind of liked what I was hearing from yours Ready guys Gavin I liked what I was hearing from your table when I was walking around Tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis That if you were shooting it at your table you d only pull back a little bit but if you re shooting it across to another person s table you d have to pull it back farther Okay any other table have a similar hypothesis So their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table and correct me if I m wrong they d only have to stretch it a little bit but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor s table they d have to stretch it further Did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that You guys did How about you guys what did you say Nicole We said that maybe we d have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables Okay so not only the amount of stretch but also the trajectory of how you aim it Alright very good How about you guys over there You d have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it Alright very good And I know you guys were coming up with the same thing So we re going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch Is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly Okay so if that s your hypothesis I think the amount of stretch that I give the lizard will make it fly a different length what would the manipulated variable be What would the thing be that you change between the different steps Anthony How far you pull it back How far you pull it back very good How far you pull it or can I put stretch also Good What would our dependent variable be What are you going to watch for How do you know if that stretch has made a difference Jada Alright very good and where else might it go Right but you re talking about your bucket and you re also talking about Very good So we re talking about Distance Alright so can I put that down for the dependent Yes Okay good How about some constants What are some things that have to stay the same Guys don t let that table do all the work come on now Alright Ada The type of lizard The type of lizard very good Would it be fair if I gave one table battery powered and the other table not right Alright very good Sierra what else The size and shape of it Size and shape of it very good Anything else that has to stay constant or the same How big is the container Alright very good How big is the container Wilson How stretchy it is Okay how stretchy it is Alright I m going to give you 30 seconds and what I would like for you to do with those 30 seconds is I d like for you to practice Alright I d like for you to practice at this point just at your table If you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end that s fine but I would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area okay Alright go ahead Without hitting your neighbor Maybe move to the side Kendra Go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference Gavin See if you have some information when you re done besides that it sticks to your neighbor s head Alright hold on and we ll try it again I promise we ll try it again at further distances in just a minute Let s think guys Can anyone make a conclusion that starts with When I change the amount of stretch Can anyone make a conclusion that starts Good job Nicole When I change the amount of stretch If I change the amount of stretch far then it goes further Okay if I change the amount of stretch when I make it further it goes further Alright Lewis You might plan for it to go one way but the way that you shoot it really it doesn t exactly go where you plan It s all over the place But if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance 
 and your ideas and we re learning from each other right Because a lot of times who do we learn from You Each other You learn from me but who else do you learn from Us You learn from each other Okay Kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen We re going to watch another weather forecast and as you re viewing this I want you to pay really close attention to

 Okay so ready to go here Okay I d like to take you back to the fifth century To a time when Attila the Hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of Gaul or Western Europe much to the chagrin of the Roman Empire But where I hear you ask Is Attila the Hun himself Well I fear he has perished He died in a drunken brawl would you believe on his wedding night And who am I I hear you ask to be telling such a tale Why I am Mrs Attila the Hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of Gaul Javelins and bows and arrows those were very well and good for tacticians such as Attila the Hun but what do I know about tactics Not much So I need something Very little you are right Josh the Hun is right So what I need is to get some sort of a war machine Now let s first think about what characteristics do I need in a weapon that would help us against to help us conquer the lands of Gaul What characteristics do we need in the weapon What do we need it to do Hurt people In other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or Force something else So a force we need to have some sort of force Range What else I m sorry Jackie Range Range the range would be a good thing especially if we can get beyond bow range right That would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far right Steph Efficiency Efficiency can you tell me more about what you re thinking Well being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering All right we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done We need to be able to not perhaps use every single Hun for it So efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it Anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages Yes Katie Possibly something that you could use again Oh yes if we only use it once that s kind of a problem isn t it We want to be able to use it repeatedly Good idea Other things we want to think about Joe Something that s mobile All right so maybe wheels might help or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried Okay those are good thoughts Jackie Accessibility like making sure it s easy to use and not like difficult to set up So if it takes a bunch of people and they re struggling to reset it maybe not a good idea Something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle All right so we ve had a good deal of ideas so far That s really good So I need some sort of a war machine Something that would have all of those properties in it Hmmm why what is this Message for you Mrs The Hun A message okay let s see Why it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet Ooh We have a picture of our new war weapon but here s the challenge I need to build the best trebuchet the best war machine that I can and I m not certain what properties what characteristics what parts of this machine I should emphasize How big they should be how strong they should be So I m going to need you to help me out I m going to make little groups of Huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet Each group can then test a different quality What sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet to see what would be the best one Caroline Caroline The weight on the opposite end All right the weight the counter weight and the load Both of those things and perhaps the ratio of them could be rather important Josh Like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle All right the lever arm and how it changes that could be an important idea Other things that we might be able to change to vary or test Anything else we might be thinking of Kate On the angle right there Ah yes the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with There s a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it So the angle of launch and changing that could be important Anything else we might try Anything else we could change We ve had some really good ideas All right so I d like to break you into your small groups and I d like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test We ll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information So I need you to prove your loyalty me Huns Build this trebuchet and test it and if Attila the Hun were here right now he d say What are you doing laying your duffs Get to work Huns Let s get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet And you can choose whatever it is that interests you You can choose something that we did or something different But what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work You have to decide I m going to change this part of it and keep everything the same until we take data Remind me first of all what it was you were changing Counterweight Counterweight so you re leaving the same object that you re launching We re just changing counterweight So what is that your weight Yes Okay so what challenges did you have if any in building this to test your counterweight We had problems with the sling and the pouch Like at first we made it really long so like that didn t really work It didn t go anywhere it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself it s kind of like too long So like it So a little engineering before you could quite get one to work but you did then eventually get one by changing the shortening the string and shortening the sling Yeah All right So at that point then it looks like you had some data and you took several trials Was there anything just off the end any pattern you happened to notice just as you were taking the data We noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like it would float and then just kind of fall So there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it Yeah like our data we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like really far to like back again What if I wanted to know not 600 grams or 650 but 625 How could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond if I wanted to know what s going to happen at 775 Make a graph or an equation Yeah Actually either of those would work coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph To me the graph is a very visual way of doing it You could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it s some other sort of a curve All right and that will allow us to look at other data points which I think would be very helpful So your job then between now and Wednesday is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were from your trebuchet without sharing all of the numbers but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found I think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down I think that s very interesting the fact that it s consistent So help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data Okay All right We can do that Hello Ready to share trebuchet Here s our data Okay so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing We were looking for the angle The angle okay and when you were trying to build your trebuchet what challenges if any did you have in trying to test this angle Well when we were doing it we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable So it couldn t be like super secure It had to be we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks so it was really easy to move Okay It wasn t a super intense trebuchet but it works Yeah we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks Now I m not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century but I think No like twigs Twigs We ll do it with twigs that s a good idea Alright so then it looks like you took some data at different angles and you figured out then the range that it went Was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data It s okay to say no Yeah we noticed you d want to start it like farther back like there d be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle Right Because then it s Because if it was positive it wouldn t really go anywhere Starting with angles that made sense that you knew would give you enough energy to start it All right and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try That the farther back you went the greater length that it would go So the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range Yes that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one Now what limited you or was there a limit You stopped at negative 45 could you have gone negative 50 or No that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small It wasn t like high up to go all the way back Ah okay all right You were commenting on being high up When we get together on Wednesday and we talk about conclusions we ll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do Where if you took the same model but just lift it up Lifted it up adapted it see if that would matter All right that sounds good So we ve got several angles to comment on If I wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees or negative 35 or at negative 50 is there some way I could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond Is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose Yeah you could probably think of an average you wouldn t assume that it would be like 100 accurate we wouldn t guarantee that but it would give a good idea All right so if you did some averaging work if you did some been thinking of Actually not so much averaging You could even set it up like Like side by side like triangles Okay okay So figuring out maybe the ratios Yeah that s That you should get here using your when you say your size and dimensions All right and that is an analysis that is so legitimate These are equations you can come up with You do have the option of doing it visually that is with a graph Where you have your angles one direction and your range the other Just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far You may find that there isn t enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you re certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that s easily recognizable So you get to choose however you want to analyze your data When we come together on Wednesday I will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one Some groups will find that there s no conclusion that the So that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers So that s your job for Wednesday and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test Also a bonus that we can measure data Okay All right thank you good job The farthest range It was 650 grams for the counterweight Six five zero Yeah Alrighty so that s good So we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that All right very good Fifth group tell us about your data and your trebuchet Okay our variable was the angle of launch as well Angle okay that s good And we analyzed it visually basically and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was the larger the range was The larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that Not really it just kind of continues As long as you continue to increase the angle you increase the range So you mean like the angle of release of the sling Or the like how far back the arm goes before you let it go How did you measure your angle Oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up the larger the distance was Okay so the larger the angle to platform Like what other angle could we have used The back arm Okay and this one was how far we pulled it back Yeah So isn t that the same angle then Yeah but we just measured it inside All right All right so slightly different perspectives we ve all found angles on All right our sixth group We varied the counterweight also Okay counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data We made a chart and a graph Okay so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed what did you graph We graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range That s reasonable The counterweight versus range All right and as you examined your chart and the graph data what did you come up with as a conclusion The more weight we put on the further the range was Was there an upper limit or not Not from the amount of weight that we tested I mean I would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle then it would probably would have bad results So that actually gives us a place to go in future If we were to try to add more to the slab that might be something kind of interesting to find out is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail That might make a difference with our big trebuchet We want the biggest one that was successful Were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet Josh The angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot All right and in fact if we were to combine that with your counterweight we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet Other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would ve liked to have added to or varied Steph When the sling did release we could never really tell where it did and we couldn t really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it s supposed to So you could never really tell 
 Three four five six We have six friends at the table And let s see I have one uh leave it there please Eulet Christmas Two Christmas Uh it s a little bit like Christmas you re right Three Oh I have three strings to put beads on but I have six friends But I you know I don t I have some beads but I don t have any more strings What could we do Your colors I think I think I think we could have You think what what do you think we could do I don t know Okay Alright does anybody have an idea We have a problem We have more friends than we have strings I want to have that one Okay well we re talking about what we re going to do Alex do you know what we could do I don t know You don t know Surafel wait just a minute cause I want everybody to help string beads Me and me and me and me are gonna share Oh What did you say We re going to share You re gonna share Give me a high five for that great solution Did you hear she said she s going to share Who are you gonna share with I share a toy I m going to share I m going to share with I m going to share with Did you forget his name Um Eulet With Ulet You re gonna share with Eulet That s a great idea Are you going to share Not a toy What about you what could you do Could you share Yes And take some turns Yes Who can you take turns with And what s her name Brianna Brianna Ask her Brianna will you string beads with me Will you string beads with me Look can you play Yes Yeah Yeah you can Good you can take turns and share and string beads Surafel Huh Can you you take turns with someone Umm Oh Look at that Yeah This is Alex You re going to take turns with Alex alright Well what do we need now We need some more beads We need some more beads Alright well I have some beads let s see I have some beads Oh boy I ve got some great colors Let me show you what we re gonna do okay Let s see whoops whoops Hold on a minute Okay Lily is gonna have yellow and Eulet is gonna have Blue Purple okay who s gonna go first Me Alright Eulet And I ll go next And you ll go next Let s see what happens with the colors when you take turns Alright let s see Eulet is Surafel sit down watch Whoops Here pull it this way Alright Eulet put his on now who s turn is it My turn My turn Who s turn is it Me This is Lily s Lily s turn Okay so look Lily s having a turn Alex watch Alex You Okay but we re not gonna stack Alright Lily put hers on now what do we do Eulet Back to Eulet that s right Eulet you can say now it s my turn Now it s my turn Can you put one on Surafel are you watching They re putting beads on their string That s nice to share It is It s nice to share and to take turns Just like I share toys You share toys And we share animals Tell her it s your turn My turn I share toys with my sister Oh that s nice And I share animals with my sister And you share animals Alright Lily may I show your friends what you and Eulet did Look Look at their colors When you take turns look you make a pattern You go purple yellow purple yellow Because you re taking turns the colors change each time That s called a pattern Yeah Alright so it s the purple turn now Eulet that means it s your turn Nice working together I m going to give Brianna blue and Natalie red Okay Here you go Let s see if you guys can take turns Oh and look Alex gets blue and Surafel what color do you get Blue Orange Oh Orange let s see here Alright remember uh oh Lily

part Say put yours on Alright Here we re gonna leave this on Wait for Alex Oh good Now it s your turn Brianna You have to talk to your friend and tell them when it s their turn Nice job Eulet and Natalie Brianna whoops You re pulling it the wrong way Pull it this way so it goes on Okay now who s turn My turn Who s turn My turn Brianna look Natalie said it s her turn Give it to Natalie Tell her your turn and then your turn is next How are we doin guys Uh oh did they come off Let me see let s see Oh uh oh Here let me come around and see if I can help you Eulet and Lily you re working so nicely Is it your turn again Alright Natalie tell Brianna when it s her turn Alright boys let s see Let s get you going again alright Here let s put these down Okay Alex has blue and Surafel has orange Surafel can you put yours on Okay Beautiful okay now who s turn is it now Now it s my turn Who s turn Do you remember me saying It s Alex Alex Alex Okay Give it to Alex Here Alex you re going to hold this part and you put your bead on Whoops What s here Oh it s a little bit tangled Let me see if I can untangle it Okay that s right now we need a red bead Surafel can you sit down now It looked like you almost fell Alright Alex yours is on Look We have orange and blue So now what do you do My turn Oh is that right Surafel s turn Oh you guys are great Seven I have seven beads You have seven beads I ll count how many beads I have One two three four five Very good Six seven Oh good You have seven too You have the same number Okay now what are we gonna do It was my turn Okay who s turn is it Alex Okay good take this give it to Alex and tell him it s give him this part and say Alex it s your turn now His turn Oh very nice Now we can count One two one two three four five six Uh

give it now to Natalie Give it to Natalie Six I ve got six Look give this to Natalie and tell her it s your turn now Natalie Wow we are doing some nice work Did you give it back to Surafel for his turn Alex yay Alright there s an orange one Surafel what are you going to do now This is of it all What do you do now Alex Pretty yay Tell him Alex your turn Uh oh Did we have a bead get away Uh oh Uh oh This bead doesn t want to go on the string It s five I have five I like the way you re taking turns Okay you are almost finished Eulet you re working so nicely with friends And the red has Okay One two three four five six Uh oh seven eight nine ten That s okay how did that happen We ve got two blue ones on there Whoops That s okay Now Surafel is having his turn Look what I m making Oh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten Are you finished Yes Okay show me what are you going to do now Four five six Oh you did some counting good I did Okay and you have finished your turn so what do you do now You only have two left One two Is it your turn Nah Okay so what do you say You say Alex Alex Your turn Okay friends we re almost done Let me see uh oh we need a red one You know what I m going to make it so that you have the same number as your friend Okay Your turn Let s see My turn Here we go and you have the same number Okay Eulet can you talk to your partner Your turn What are you going to say Oh okay she said it s your turn Can you say thank you Thank you Okay and we are almost finished Uh oh we re doing some different turn taking here but that s okay Alright okay so now who s turn is it Alex Okay give it to Alex say Alex your turn Your turn Three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen Okay we re not counting so much right now we re taking turns Who s turn is it now My turn Natalie s turn Okay so you tell her It s Lily s turn I m next That s right tell her this is Lily Lily s turn Look What happened Did you finish Yeah Did you string all your beads Yeah You did All of your beads are on your string Let s look Oh and you too Nice Job Look You did orange and blue orange and blue orange and lots of blue orange and blue orange and blue Beautiful Okay I m gonna lay it right here Let s look at yours because you finished and you used all of your beads Oh look you used different colors You did blue can you say it with me Red blue red blue red azul rojo azul rojo Can you say that Brianna Azul rojo azul rojo azul You guys did a great job of taking turns We finished We finished You finished Look you used all of your beads your trays are empty Let s hold it up and look at the colors and the pattern you made Can you tell me the pattern Purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow Yay And we know that you took turns because the colors changed every time It s clean up time You guys did a great job And you re right it is we are finished We learned how to take turns with a partner and we put beads on a string and made a color pattern because we took turns Yes It was all good and I think you all get to ring the good job bell Good job taking turns Eulet Good job taking 
 So we go back remember this Do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest Okay What s happening is things are getting not broken up Another example of that would be measure 16 to 17 You would not want to breathe at the end of 16 Now I want to go back to 13 and I want you to do what we did yesterday where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties So what that does at 13 is it should da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daa da da da da da da da da da da da da dum Okay It s kind of funny to do that on the bass drum so just play the regular part on the bass drum okay I can try to Nah I d rather you not because it s going to muffle it s going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing Try it at 13 everybody Da da da da da da da Working on accents One two and ready and go Look at measure 15 Da da daa da da da da What s happening is some of you are changing 15 to this Tell me what s wrong with this Anybody recognize what s wrong with that Adrian You played four Yeah I played four sixteenth notes and then I played a note on beat four It s got a one and two three e and up Listen again here s the correct way Oops wrong finger Listen again Try that Measure 15 One and two and ready and go Again More accent That last note s really short and it s really strong One two 15 and play Now play it the way it s written but feel it the way you just played it That will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note One two ready and go and Okay see how it places it very crisply Let s go back to 13 Play it Break it down into the sixteenths Da da da da da da da Ready 13 we re going to go all the way through 20 One and two and ready and play and Now I m going to get to what we are beginning to learn today I m going to go ahead and put my tie up here Now is there anyone who can tell me what this is What is that Daniel A dotted eighth note This is a dotted eighth note Who can tell me what this note is Sedekia One sixteenth note It is a sixteenth note so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note Now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot With that in mind can somebody tell me what the value of that note is Cole It would last for like three beats Three beats And then you would have a sixteenth note Okay I think you re on the right track it would last for three of something but not three beats Landon Three fourths of a beat It would be three fourths of a beat so let s think about this remember an eighth note in 4 4 time gets half of a beat Everybody what s half of a half One fourth One fourth so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat Well that sounds a little bit complicated but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here So who can tell me what I would write for counts under this dotted eighth note Raise your hand Lydon Would it be one e One e because that s the same as having three of both and Jaylin what would go here a e Okay so this is just another way of writing this Let s do a measure of counting that Ready And go and One e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and Now I want all my first row to do that four times okay And go and One e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and Second row ready and go and One e and a two and one e and a two 
 You re totally fine So you guys will be using I m assuming a meter tape Yeah For measurements And then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we re good Strength versus strength qualifies ten times Ok so I like that you re making everyone go clockwise everyone s doing ten alright And then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot Ok There s a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on No shoes on ok perfect You guys are good Ok so wingspan what are your units you guys are measuring in Centimeters and you re going tip to tip right And then what was the ability again They ll take their shoes off try to touch their toes And then we ll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot Ok good In what units Centimeters Centimeters Did you say take shoes off or no Yeah Ok cool You guys can start collecting data I ll come back to you Ok what do you guys got Same thing we got yesterday Recap me Hair color You were hair color Why the hell don t you have something else I don t know Ok so here s my question Cause I was thinking about this last night You re gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data How would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color Ok so you re gonna assign numbers numeric data to shades Zero to ten Or one to ten One to ten Yeah One being the lightest The lightest lightest We should probably get this straightened out before we do it right And then ten being the darkest Ok before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm Draw a line out so I could see where you re getting your number data And then what is your characteristic That was your characteristic What is your ability How many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet Ok so we ll probably do that in the hallway Does that sound fine Meter tapes are up there That s a lot of guys So give me a real quick scale then you guys can start Ok One and ten So that s blonde and really blonde And like really dark brown So where would red fall in Like me Like right there So you re gonna make blonde one end The low end are we all in agreeance on that Yeah and mine is like in the middle Ok and then the other far end s gonna be the darkest brown Yeah Or black Or black Are you gonna have everyone taking data on that Or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color You know what I mean so there s not a ton of variation Measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger And then hopping on one foot right On your tiptoe Or no balance balance And then once your heel touch into the ground it s done And your hands can do whatever you want Ok are we shoe on shoe off Shoe off Shoe off and is it right or left foot Right foot for everybody Ok Right foot shoe off on tiptoe Max two minutes Max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground Or their other foot Or their other foot So it could be either or Okeydoke So just a kind of a flashback to remind us This has been a couple daytime span here Our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil So as we work through this unit we re gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past We ve been specifically as I ve said before looking at one specific fossil foot fossil length right The idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together we start to get a clear image of what s going on Again our goal was to determine if there s a relationship between the characteristic you chose the ability you chose and a person s foot fossil I asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit That could be an indirect relationship a direct one a trend or no relationship What I m gonna ask you to do for a minute talk to your neighbors Compare your data Make sure we re on the same page in determining a relationship And then I d like you to come up and post your data It s gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data So for example if group one what was your characteristic For fossil length Hand spans We re gonna put characteristic on the left side so they re gonna right hand span for us And then what type of relationship did you guys see for that Direct Direct so all you re gonna do is do this That s all we need to report Ok in your lab packet you are going to find some little graphs You re gonna be asked to record everyone s data I ve also given you a supplementary sheet cause you re gonna need more graphs I messed up and didn t tell you So what s gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here You will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you ll be looking at everyone s data and drawing conclusions ok So take a minute to talk to your groups I ll come around and give you some markers Determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are Post them on the board and then we ll talk No Can you determine it No Cause they re not They re just kind of clustered It was like more not clustered Ok so we re gonna have a trend fall in between where I guess the trend really is between 15 and What are we lacking You know what it was 12 30 last night Fossil foot length stride length Ok so we re having a trend falling between what s our lowest Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones Ok I think that works So you re gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there Need help Ok whatcha got Would you draw a line for a trend Yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning So this person s kinda like an outlier right so let s just for argument s sake take them out Does that help clear the data up at all You could say no it s ok They re all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times Ok so we ve got a pretty wide range here right For trend we tend to see more of a skinnier range So if you look at our options it s definitely not a direct or indirect I would say based on what you showed me right Trend wise it s kind of a wide range So what would we determine what s our other option No relationship Yeah I would probably go So up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation ok Here s your marker With this one cause it s kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area But then there s also the increase Ok so here s my question That s a good question When I look at this data right If I had a pick excluding this line if I had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall where would you pick Up here Why Yeah it appears to be going this way So that would indicate that you have a direct relationship It s kind of the easiest way to look at it Ok group number one Hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height What kind of relationship are we seeing here Direct so the bigger the foot fossil the bigger the hand span So just to clarify hand span we re talking tip of thumb to tip of finger Correct Why do we see that So I asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section so you might want to turn to that page everyone cause you wanna gather some ideas here Why are we seeing this Why do you think we re seeing that relationship What did you guys say Because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size You re not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands Usually Ok So I have a question for everyone in class I bought some new shoes and I like them Do you like them They re so big on you They re a little loud Don t worry I won t wear them on testing days They look good What s the problem here They re like way too big like twenty sizes too big How do you know Why do you know that my foot s not this big Yeah it doesn t look proportional to my body And exactly what Megan said bodies in general are proportional Now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long really lanky arms Or you might know someone that has extremely long legs They re kind of fitting outside that pattern But in general bodies are proportionate right And so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics right Because of this idea that we are proportioned You re not gonna see Shaquille O Neal wearing a size three shoe He ll fall over He wouldn t be able to support his own body Common sense applies here That s a good one Jump height So you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there s no indirect or direct relationship Why do you think we saw that Jump height is an ability versus Ok jump height is an ability you are correct It depends on muscles versus structure Ok so it s depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot I remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high I could jump in itself so I guess with your foot depending on what size shoe you have that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body By having them reach guys What was your point When you set up your lab Cause I remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you re gonna have them make a mark and then they re gonna jump Well it s so that the taller people didn t just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them Cause then it s already the distance like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are Ok So you re saying that by measuring the height you factored that idea in So Mr Bieber isn t totally outjumping say Adrian who s a little bit shorter So you already kind of factored that in Why did we not see a connection though Megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe opposed to foot Cause everybody kind of jumped the same There wasn t any variation So it didn t really matter what foot size you have Ok So when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly They found the same general area in that same general pattern That s why theres a trend It was all in just one spot So in general when we re looking at fossils would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil No Probably not Which kind of makes sense anyway Group two Group two didn t get their data plotted but let s take a peek They did foot fossil length and height If you were to make an assumption if there was a relationship what would you all assume would be the relationship Direct why direct Cause it s proportional Bingo bodies are proportional You re gonna see that pattern as we work through this Proportional ok Average stride We didn t really get a graph but it didn t look very direct It was a little more indirect More indirect I think so Like this So you re saying longer No no Like there wasn t really a pattern Oh so your e saying no relationship Yeah Does that make sense Alana says no I saw this Why Well just based on the proportional idea if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs So you re arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship I think a direct You would say direct Claire and then Barrett Well cause we had the same thing but a little bit different And well backwards It couldn t really be that accurate because it wasn t a very long distance and people had different ideas of walking Some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower It wasn t just like an average So you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct But you re saying you agree that we should see direct No we should see an indirect An indirect Longer leg shorter strides Direct Longer legs longer strides But you re arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn t lend itself to collect proper data Yeah Ok good point I think it was also just I was asked just to walk like I normally do and I don t take very long strides I kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when I just normally walk Ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am I supposed to walk So maybe we could have captured it in a different manner We could have designed the experiment if you re already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride I think no relationship is accurate because my stride length I would assume is based on how long my legs are I have very long legs but everybody knows I have a small foot I mean I m still proportional like I m normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else Ok so you re kinda arguing that maybe you re not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional There was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides It was kind of just all over the place Ok So what are we labeling this Direct question mark no relationship question mark If we re basing it on the data that they had I d say no relationship Ok if we re basing it on the data even though we didn t plot it Looking at their actual data we would say no relationship Could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship Yes So for our data collection we ll leave no relationship But keeping in mind that very valid point that if you re gonna have longer feet more than likely you have longer legs More than likely you re gonna take longer strides But inherent as Claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment that maybe that didn t shine through Group three Hair color versus foot fossil length No relationship Is this shocking to anyone Yes Even though they had a great numeric scale Why Why no relationship Bubs I didn t have anything to do with it It s like a gene base Hair color is determined by Your DNA Does your DNA determine your foot length Yes it does But not the same gene Ok but not the same gene Ok now you re getting very technical I appreciate that Yes sir I think its partially because Would you think that there would be a connection Like smaller foot lighter hair Well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity Some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others Ok so maybe you re arguing the sample size The idea that we were to survey globally maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller would have different I could see that Yeah Well I think it has nothing to do with it because I m six feet tall and Franco s under five feet and we both have dark hair So obviously Yeah it s got nothing to do with it Ok so on face value looking at hair color Would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color No Ok I would agree There s no connection there No connection My question though is There are organisms that lived in the past And we have very I would say We have certain ideas about what their coloring was like How would we come up with that then How would scientists come up with that idea Of the coloring of certain organisms Caroline Well if you say that lizards would be or dinosaurs would be green it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don t know for sure So you re thinking evolutionary connection It ll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment Yeah Yes Claire I think you also said a few days ago About how you re supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now So if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now Ok so again you re doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color possibly due to some benefit we can assume in the past Good nice job 
 Work of art in front of the class using the smart board We have to Continue working please We have to finish the whole thing today You should have enough time if y all aren t drawing on the artwork that much But y all been working hard and a little bit of playing but working pretty well After you get finished with the analysis go ahead and flip over and start on your interpretation What you think is going on or what the artist is trying to portray in the work of art All right so y all are on interpretation Yeah What do y all think of the work of art Kaitlin what do you think of the work of art Well it makes us feel like calm It made me feel calm It made y all feel calm No it made me feel calm It made me feel calm Okay Now have any of y all been out west Huh Out west like Colorado Wyoming places like that Yeah Yeah Well sometimes in the mountains they have places where the snow has melted and there are actually small lakes or ponds up inside the mountains So you could actually either be looking at a lake where you could drive up to or something that s hidden in the mountains So if you re calm that s a pretty good idea All right guys what are y all working on now We re on judging the building I keep working on one Okay Can you tell me what you have about interpretation I think of this art as a rainy day The sky is a dull gray I like the bright colors on the doors It s like a mixture of happiness and boredom Since it looks like it s raining the dark clouds at the top of the painting when it goes from white to dark Like from light and it s going to dark that s when you can tell it s about to rain Okay gotcha gotcha Sounds good That sir is my interpretation Okay and with judgment what are y all think about the work of art right now My judgment of the art is that it s kind of a boring day It s slightly dull but you don t know what s about to happen Sounds good so far Keep working Y all doing all right over here Yeah we re doing I wrote my opinion Now he s gonna write his opinion Yeah And then Brody will write his opinion Sounds great All right Y all on interpretation What y all had Oh y all are each doing interpretation Yes sir We were going to do that for judgment and interpretation Sounds great And what are y all looking at now for interpretation with the subway painting We re doing what it makes you feel Okay what do you have so far Well he wrote most of them Okay so he can read it Okay actually it makes me feel like traveling Okay since they re on a train And that s pretty much it All right Who would like to tell me what they are thinking of for interpretation on valley flowers I don t know I mean it s a good painting but it s not really my favorite Okay It s not very exciting So that would be for judgment You don t find it exciting Okay kind of boring What do you think of the work of art I think it s a bit dull because there s not really any colors or anything like that and it s got the same colors where each Right here is green and right here is orange and blues back there You know if I was using my imagination I would think of maybe The Incredibles in where the mole men came up at the end and were taking over the Earth So these could be tunnel boring machines Start using the principles of design okay So you look at the packet for the principles of design With the principles of design you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art So instead of shapes you may be telling me what s something you see in your work of art You ve got Gold Is Where You Find It What s one thing you see in the work of art Gold You see gold what else do you see The miner Miner and what is the miner doing Drilling Drilling okay so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art So go ahead and start on the second part with analysis if you re ready to start on that Alright are we doin alright here Yeah we don t get how was the work created Okay you may have actually answered that when you were up here If you look at the packet right here and the title of the work of art is The Sky Pond read the rest for me Who it was who created it Kauvar Kauvar yeah close enough Smith Smith Born Cape Ugh this is hard If you can t pronounce it just do the best you can Giradeau Missouri Missouri 1893 Died Denver Colorado 1977 Oil on canvas Uh What did you say Oil on canvas Is how it was created and it was about this size right here okay So that tells you how the work of art was created Later on you re gonna look at why the work of art was created and what purpose it served Yes What do I say how I know what we do It says if they draw it in three dimensional Okay And they take some kind of colored pencil or painting and then sketch it like you do and then they go from dark to light Yeah And then they make the texture from the sun is over here and there s a little bit of shade because this would be covering all this There would be a shade right here So it s over here it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree Yeah and this side of the house roof and that side of the house And you ve got are these shapes back here Or are those somethin else These are shapes Okay are shapes flat or three dimensional Three dimensional Shape forms are three dimensional alright Oh yeah Yeah So those are forms So those are forms yeah But you were right about everything You were right about the sun you were right about the texture the shading everything that s really good So you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger and also oil on canvas Continue working please Alright so y all are on analysis now And what work of art do y all have Y all have got Subway Alright so what are y all lookin at in the Subway for analysis so far It s something asymmetrical balance It s asymmetrical balance Yeah There are three types You ve got symmetrical balance when everything is exactly the same you ve got asymmetrical balance when it s weighted the same So there s the same amount of weight visually It s not exactly the same And then you ve got radial symmetry which is a project we did a little bit earlier Okay Good So is it saying that shapes especially right here these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat Cause these are more 3 D than these These kind of have shadows and are free So we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the outside factors I guess Yes mm hmm Good Keep going Alright Would this be water That is possibly water right there Yes it is And what part are y all on Y all are on the analysis right now Okay And y all are lookin at the Valley Farms by Rose Dickinson Okay cool So what do y all have so far for analysis Colors from the scene go together it can show Could you speak a little louder Sorry Colors from the scene go together It can show a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there A small fire is going on with smoke coming from the flames Smoke is coming from the mountains Sounds good keep going Alright let s check in over here How are y all doin Good Okay wow y all have got a lot for an analysis Alright what else do you have So y all are about ready to start on analysis Yes sir Okay so let s look here Now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made are related to each other i e how the effects were organized complement one another or create harmony or distress This step can often be the most confusing because it is very similar to the first and can easily overlap A good suggestion is think about all the principles of art movement rhythm variety portion emphasis and balance and contrast work together okay So think about how they work together to create this work of art and tell me everything you see in the work of art but not by shape and colors Alright The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will What A texture What The The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will Like he is actually drilling near a cave Creative Now would you say these warm colors or cool colors Warm Warm way warm Warm Now why would you say they re warm colors Cause they re darker They re darker Okay It shows that the colors of the background Yeah Now something else Does it look like he blends into the background No He doesn t Yeah uh huh Okay so think about that too If he stood out he would look like he maybe didn t belong but it kind of looks like he belongs there I like what you said keep working I ll be back in a minute to check on you Alright Guys Turn around Alright what are y all workin on now Analysis Analysis What do y all have for analysis so far Patrick I didn t get that I got one for variety and balances Okay so something is different from this picture Can you just read to me what you have so far please Something s different from this top picture because the floor is green beneath the room because it s different because I thought I thought the floor s just one color so that s why it s different Okay that s good and it s also different from up here You could say that there s a contrast Let s look for the definition of contrast in here Do you all know what the definition of contrast is or what contrast is Two things are very different from I was on balance I m on balance now Okay so contrast is what One more time I m sorry Two things that are very different and have a large contrast Okay so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast Yeah because they re bright colors and they give out perspective What about the two Cs Okay two C s so Keep going Alright what part are y all on now Analysis And y all have got The Subway okay So can you read to me what you have or tell me something that you haven t added but you were about to Jaymen s adding that Okay I wanna add it has radial balance because you can kinda see where the center print is and then you can kind of see all these people all these stuff Okay now I have a question Have y all seen that there s a commercial on a few months ago It s a radio commercial Yeah The TV where she s sitting in the train and she s watching the TV someone s reading the newspaper and she s watching the TV And she steps out and it looks like they may have gotten the idea from that ad from this work of art cause there s lots of people on the train car they re reading newspapers and she steps into the future by actually reading her s on a Samsung Galaxy or something like that So that d be a good connection to popular culture okay Hello I was just Which one we were talkin about earlier Okay sounds good What s up Okay Alright what ya on Okay what added or what have y all gotten to since I was last over here We see the ocean behind the mountains green grass is covering the farmland and the lines on the mountains are curved not pointed The mountains are curved Okay The houses are spread apart the sky is a light green blue Sounds good and it sounds like y all are just about finished with analysis so are y all gonna be moving on to interpretation next Okay Yeah Active listening right hand Active listening left hand Ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups but please remember that we are all doing different works of art studying them and we re also discussing them together So that everybody s able to work without yelling across can we take it down just a notch a little bit please Keep it a little bit lower I m not telling you to whisper and I m not telling you to stop what you re doing cause your doing a great job Just let us take it down a notch please Keep working please Alright how are y all doin over here We re doing really good Okay what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art It said that for the first question well the first thing we said the artist Douglass Crockwell is using repetit well is repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting And right now we re writing how classes are organized And how it s saying what we introduced for description Okay now with Paper Workers Now let s look at the workers The workers do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art No They kind of look like they blend in So could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery Mhmm Okay so that s something you may wanna think about when you re working on analysis or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit Can you go touch the keyboard to bring the Smart Board back on please Alright what are y all workin on now I don t know You don t know okay You don t know what principles you ve covered or you don t know what aspect of the painting you re working on right now We re working on analysts and so far we ve covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other We covered what colors they have and how they can relate We re about to work on shapes Shapes are in there So let s think about texture some Yeah we are Look at the definitions okay And let s look at I wouldn t look at space or balance variety and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion okay Okay we are completely totally and absolutely confused of analysis I m not You re just Analysis okay I m not I m completely finished She s going all haywire Okay what s wrong with analysis here I don t know Nothing Nothing s wrong with the analysis Nothing s wrong with analysis She s going haywire I do not understand what art is Active listening right hand please Active listening left hand Table four please Ladies and gentlemen when we stopped a moment ago because we had gotten too loud let s take it down to a whisper now That way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud So right now let s take it to a whisper for our discussions please Alright with analysis what you re doing is you re looking at the principles of design Don t worry about balance Let s flip to the beginning Now let s look at texture Do you have a texture in here Yeah And what kind of texture do you have Well it s really bumpy but some of it is smoother like a snow Okay so that s what you could talk about in the analysis Also in the analysis with balance is it asymmetrical symmetrical or radial Now symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides Radial is when it s radiating out from a point like a rim or a pizza Is it either one of those So I d look a little bit at asymmetrical balance and then variety I look at the definition and then determine what variety you see in here and after that go ahead and move over to interpretation okay That way if you re being frustrated you don t have to get bogged down and worry about it you can move to the next step You might find that easier okay Keep going thanks Alright so y all are on interpretation now Yep Okay what are y all about to do for interpretation Can someone read me the interpretation part Basically how does the painting make you feel What does it make you think of Don t say you think a painting sucks artwork sucks That said that goes in the next step What do you think What do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer Okay so let s bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you re working on the questions and think about telling me a story or what s going on Now does this look like you re in a cafeteria No Does it look like you re in a school Oh yeah No It looks like a barber shop Okay and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop He s shaving cutting someone s hair Now what about over here These guys are probably waiting for their turn Okay that s what you need to tell me in interpretation What all is going on or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story We re talking about the story that s created in the work of art Alright what part are y all on interpretation Yeah Okay so It kind of makes me feel like It makes me feel sad It was when I think of it before and it really doesn t make me feel sad I m not really sure how it makes me feel but I kind of think that maybe he was trying to say it went from cause this is kind of simple Okay And I keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason But I think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler and it kind of got more modern I like that I like that And also one thing that this makes me think of is earlier this year we studied the artist Jacob Lawrence and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train controlling that with only industry in the background With the big cog or wheel here it kind of looks like a train over here with industry in the background But I like what you re saying about the calmer times and the more difficult times and I think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation It doesn t look like a train though Yeah Alright how are y all doing Y all doin alright Hey what part are y all workin on now Y all got Valley Farm Yeah Yeah Interpretation Okay what do y all have so far for interpretation This painting makes us feel bright but kind of boring The smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it We also wonder Why is there a fire with nobody there Okay sounds good Ah can you put your stool back up on two legs One more time Thanks Alright what are y all on right now Analysis and y all have moved on to interpretation Mhmm Sounds good Active listening right hand Active listening left hand Right in here we have about seven minutes left This should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation and start on their judgment today After you get finished with your interpretation one thing I would like you to focus on is why you think the work of art was created Think about the time period in which it was created and why the artists were creating works of art Think about your work of art particularly and you ll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that so continue working on what you re working on We have about seven minutes Next time you come in what we re gonna be doing is we re gonna be working on presenting So those groups that have enjoyed this will be able to look at the Smithsonian packet find their information add that to what they ve been doing today and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about 
 Today I m going to introduce to you our new project and it s based on the concept of surrealism When you look at this word you should recognize a smaller word within it Does anyone recognize the smaller word Real Real that s right The word real And we know real is the way things really look when we see them or the way they appear But the word sur transforms that word And because this is a French word sur means beyond So now what the word surrealism implies is beyond reality or the way things really appear So what does that look like It looks very dreamlike It doesn t necessarily make sense A lot of different things go on in surrealism and I m going to show you a few examples right now These are the three characteristics that we re going to focus on The first characteristic is out of place objects If you look at this example up here what s out of place in this picture Can anyone tell me Trevor The guy s face What s over his face just floating there Can anyone tell You re up close Matthew You see what that is An apple It s a green apple okay And that is an out of place object Definitely surreal These are examples of surrealism This example right here What s in here Jordan Train There s a train coming out of a fireplace Okay again an out of place object These are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects Another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes Scenes that do not make sense They re beyond real What s going on in this scene Kurt There s like giant butterflies Yeah The butterflies grew They re huge Now they re like the props on the windmills What s going on in this Can anyone tell What makes that surreal John Like huge makeup Yeah the si again the size of such little things grew tremendously and they re filling up the room Also the interior of the room is now looking like the sky So what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really really big The last characteristic that we see in surrealism is there it is Normal objects acting abnormally So in these examples I ll go through real quickly Do you see these clocks They re not acting normally These clocks are melting they re dripping they re stretching they re falling down You can see that In this one the artist drew a person looking into the mirror but does he see his reflection No No The mirror s not operating normally It s surreal It s beyond real What it s doing is it s showing the back of his head And again in this one it s kind of hard to tell but there are three swans and the reflection is of three elephants So the reflection in the water is not acting normally These are three characteristics of surrealism all right So why surrealism Why this style of art Does anyone have any guesses of why anyone or why these artists created something like this Yeah Because it s like a modern form of art Okay yeah That s actually a very good definition Cara Maybe to make it look interesting Okay good To make it look funny Okay good Guys those are all excellent excellent answers Here is another thing that went into surrealism Like lots of art it s influenced by what s going on around it or what happened before it So these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism And the first style of art is known as Dada art This type of art is where the artist took things and they tried to make something that wasn t considered art They took random objects like a bicycle wheel and the stool and put it together and said Okay this is not art And that was an example of the style They also took a famous painting like the Mona Lisa scribbled mustache and a beard There it is That s not art And that was really the whole idea of Dada It was like anti art Another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism Symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something And in this example it s the idea of death There s this dark angel depicted over this man who s already halfway down in the ground All this white snow that symbolizes life around him And it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols And that s what that one depicts The other example or another influence of surrealism is metaphysical painting This one s very very hard to understand and that s what the idea was with the style It was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation Basically one in which you do not know what you re looking at You don t know what the objects are You might know something but you don t know why it s there or what part of it it is And it s very very illogical and doesn t make sense These three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism So when you look at these three styles of art you can kind of see what they led to They led to this style of art which is known as surrealism So now where to start Here s what s going on today Today you are going to start with and you can open your folders up and you ll see this slide What we re going to do is we re going to start drawing today We are going to start by making a connection all right And if you look at this example up here on the board or and you can look at your slides too What we re going to do you can just take your stuff off Leann leave it back there and then join your table okay What we re going to do is I want you to come up with something that means something to you and that s like your theme to start with Maybe it s a hobby an activity a memory anything that s meaningful to you that s your starting point Then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise So these are our options that I just discussed Those are the characteristics Do you want to move it around change the location of it Do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene Or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn t be doing Let me give you an example Lily what s your favorite food Strawberries Strawberries What s your favorite holiday Joe Christmas Jacob what s your favorite animal A dog Okay So this is my surrealist example to you You have a Christmas tree but instead of a Christmas tree you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it So that s kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example These are some examples that I have that I did These are some of my drawings This first one and sometimes you don t even know where these drawings are coming from I wanted to take an object and stretch it I wanted to make it act abnormally So I chose a spoon And what I did was I thought well a spoon needs to catch something So this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops Why Because it s really dry wherever it is You can see all the cracks So that was kind of like my first idea The second sketch that I did was I wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting An unreal scene in an unreal place So what I thought was well pineapples are tropical Why not cut open a pineapple and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees okay You re probably wondering what we re going to do with these Today is sketching but what s going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting This is an example of what the painting might look like when it s all done I chose the pineapple one all right So we are going to be doing a watercolor painting but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting s going to look like Up here on the board I think this is going to help you a lot This is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings and there s a variety of different things that the artist has done They might be food they might be animals they might be instruments they might be people they might be landscapes There s lots of things to look at I want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings I m going to give you paper right now Use this sheet Start with making a connection all right Start with making a connection and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal all right How do you draw hands Hands That s okay hands You know what This is just a sketch So this is a detail that doesn t or this is a part that you don t really need to worry about So tell me what s going on What makes this surreal Um That s what I want to know Because it s the birthday party in the present Okay So which of these options do you think you re focusing the most on This one Okay and why Because a present usually doesn t open Okay so the present so the party is within the present So the present gets opened up and then there s a party Okay What else can we do to make it like maybe a little bit more like bam something going on That s the only thing I was thinking about you know Like maybe Like balloons and Yeah balloons Like they re com they re flowing out That d be really cool All right that s good What should I like do for like for like the face The face on a Baseball Baseball And what are we using for the parts of the face So this is a baseball bat Okay And I Okay These are the baseball bases Oh the bases okay Yeah And this is and this is Okay So you re combining you re combining A lot a lot of different things So why freckles Because like I thought putting more into it would make it more interesting Okay You know what I think would make this really more interesting is the background What s going on around the face Um Think about it Think about it What could we do Where could this be In the sky I don t know So what would represent the sky What could you draw to represent the sky Clouds Try that Maybe draw some clouds I think I think that s going to make your picture more interesting Something like that Because like someone hit a home run Yeah okay And maybe some action lines around the ball You know like a little Yeah That looks really good I like that I like that one a lot A dog eating pizza Okay Brittney Yeah I don t know how to draw horses A horse Yeah Why do you need a horse Because I want to draw like a horse What were you going to do Like A horse A horse with a farm inside of it Inside of it So what do you mean inside of it though Like in here do like a farm and cows and Well here s a suggestion because I like your idea a lot Why don t we we can use this as a resource Why don t we draw I ll help you with this just the back of the horse okay So we ll just work we ll focus on like the neck and the back and then the tail kind of coming down like this okay So you see where I m going with this Now what I m thinking is why don t you draw your farm scene on the back Like almost that it s like kind of been placed on there like a little miniature scene Like so maybe on here you could draw the silo the barn and everything on there Good Eyes on me One two three Okay guys you re doing a really really good job with your sketching and everything and I don t I want you to keep going But we do need to stop for a minute And based on the drawings that I m seeing I see some really good examples of surrealism and you re showing me that you understand it I bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art you could pick out the one that represents surrealism Take a look up here on the board I have three Tabasco sauce posters okay One two three and four Show me with your fingers holding them up in the air which one of these is an example of surrealism Think about it for a minute While you think about it I m going to wiggle my mouse so I can okay What s an example of which one is a Jess Okay everyone had four That s good Why Why that one Why d you pick that one Because like Nope hold on I was going to let Jessie answer first What makes that one surreal Think about it Michael go ahead The sides are like coming off the bottle Okay And the pepper s like putting out the sauce Okay good Anything else Erin It s like out on this like island Yeah definitely definitely Like a lot of things make this one surreal What does surreal mean again Who remembers Me It means like not like like not real but like in a different form Right Beyond real Beyond real Okay And this is a great example of that Beyond reality Okay Here s what I need you to do now okay I have one more Oh I might have to re I have one more slide that I want to show you up on the board and if you open up your folders you ll see this You ll see this slide And I printed it out for you What I m going to have you do right now in the next couple minutes I m going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table You might have to switch three ways or four ways or one way And I want you to assess the drawing that you get Now if you get one that has lots of drawings just pick one of them okay Here s what I want you to do on the sheet This is easy First thing What s the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received Write it down Maybe you noticed a big basketball Maybe you notice whatever it is write it down Then I want you to check these little circles Whichever of these options that you see that that person used I want you to check them out Okay Michael And then I want you to write This is the one that everyone stumbles with They re like What does this mean All I m saying is what do you think that person meant in that drawing What do you think the meaning is If you don t know put a question mark All right And then what suggestions do you have for that person Maybe they you know if you did a background it would look really nice Or maybe you know what Maybe you ve got to lose something You ve got way too much going on I can t tell what it is So this is not going to take you very long but it s important because it shows that shows me that you understand what you re looking at and it also helps the person get a better drawing which is going to be used for the painting So I want you to switch drawings right now Everyone switch And I want you to use the sheet and I want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you re looking at okay So you re going to do this independently and I ll come around and I ll check with you in a little bit That s the first thing that you see Write down the first thing that you see all right So Lily what s the first thing that you see in your in this picture Okay What do you think it is Okay What do you think this is as a whole Don t say anything because I know it s yours But this is good because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to So what s the first thing that you know That you th what do you see Just maybe you recognize it just as water Anything else Maybe a blanket Okay Write that down Okay that s a good start What s the first thing that you saw Almost everything is crooked That s a good ob that s a really good observation Because everything is crooked Good So what options do you think were used in this Now which one did you select Normal object acting abnormally That s right It s clearly these objects are acting abnormally That s good That was a good that was another good observation So you just keep moving through Did you write down your first reaction Mm hmm Okay And okay So normal objects acting abnormally 
 Hello guys After all the hard work you ve put in on doing your presentations and your tri board and all the really cool stuff you ve done now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you ve done all this research for Okay So first off doing a little poll Which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use Solar energy Why It looks pretty cool and I don t know it seems like the most efficient way because the sun s always there and the sun won t run out That s the word whenever you re done using it You can sell it You can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night You can sell it Okay so he thinks solar Who else Okay Go ahead I like the wind Oh so you can talk to him Because you want to be able to talk to each other right I liked the wind one because it stored up the battery And the battery whenever it wasn t windy and so it kind of was always there It didn t matter about the wind Yeah you can answer the question I also think that wind s the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind you can also make money off of that So maybe if you get it in enough homes you won t even have to have a job You can make money off that That s a very good point That s a very good point making money off of that energy source Which other ones did we say could make money Um the solar Solar can make money Well I like the wind Because it s like the sun is going to burn up one day but the wind is always going to be there And the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die but that s okay Okay well what are some pros and cons then So you just said birds would die if we use wind power okay Does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power I think birds dying isn t that bad because you know we eat birds so I don t think it would be that bad if birds do die I mean I don t think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy Not as much as oil or any of that other stuff Yeah or like we eat birds The other one I like is the hydro one that James did because His was ridiculous That was nice So what part of it were you most impressed with Like not like the demonstration but it was a great demonstration but hydroelectric power in general what part of that Like how if you have a pond or something you can put it in there and then it will power up your whole house Do we need moving water Oh yeah you need moving water to have that You d have to have a stream but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water And if you really wanted to spend some money there s also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir So that one actually sounds pretty good So somebody want to defend theirs Rakif I don t really like mine because Which one did you do I did oil Natural Gas Oil and natural gas okay Why not Because mine isn t as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy so it s probably going to run out pretty soon Like oil natural gas and coal do run out They re not going to be as here as much as the wind or hydro or something like that Well there s a lot of dangers involved with using oil right Oil rigs pipelines lots of dangers involved right Oil prices can cause high gas prices That s true too Remember in your presentation you talk about some of the dangers What were those dangers and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources For oil Yeah The pipelines can burst and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out They could cause another oil spill Explosions But coal I know you re supposed to like stick up for your natural resource but I kind of think coal can be good but it s mostly bad because a lot of people s lives are getting killed because of all the gasses smells and being down there for so long And I think that s also very bad And the land it hurts the land and the environment Coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it All the coal dust it can cause a lot of lung problems So the miners that go down there they re risking their lives right Yeah Any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal No Nuclear energy What Nuclear energy is the worst Okay what about nuclear energy How dangerous was that when you looked it up It s a six out of ten chance Of what happening It depends It costs way too much first of all to build it It is very expensive That s true It s got a lot of risks like if it gets into your water or if you breathe in the radiation I imagine it could It smells bad Okay does collecting oil use more energy than it provides Good question What do you mean by collecting oil Like if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil does it use more energy than it provides No I don t think so Because in my presentation it said it produces like a widespread like a very large amount of energy And also that your wave and tidal power powers our system as you said in your presentation Oh good point Those two actually work together When you talk about the wave and tidal power that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling So that s a very good thing as well It s a benefit of drilling Absolutely Are there different energies that do benefit each other Yes the solar energy and wind Because the wind energy is based off the sun because of how the sun waves come onto the Earth and then it turns this sun mill so it produces the turning of the mill so the sun and solar energy and wind energy The solar energy and the wind they actually work together because I ve seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top One then the other can go That s okay I think solar energy is a really good thing because for a lot of power plants like for times the condition of natural resources like wind even hydroelectric if there s a drought or something or not enough water flow you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant or anywhere Right because we ve found that solar is pretty cost feasible right Yeah it s not that expensive And actually you won t have to pay an electrical bill if you get that If you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something you re better off just using the solar panel It would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine or to have the solar panels power the turbine It doesn t power it It s just like another way to get energy at the same time that you re getting the wind When there s no wind there s not much of a wind That s what the battery s for Hmm interesting I have a question for solar power too For solar power how can I make aluminum more efficient in the future Well it doesn t use a lot of the gas so it doesn t affect the environment So it doesn t affect your breathing And you don t need solar panels like you don t need to turn stuff on during the day because the sun through the windows can give you light and then can store up for the night Okay I have a question What natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future Like 50 or so years from now Wind It was used like 3 000 years ago so if it was used 3 000 years ago I think it would be used 3 000 years in the future That s not necessarily true because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes The problem with the wind thing is it can be used in country like rural areas because in other areas you can t put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood Because you can t can you put one You mean I could put one outside the school here Well it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school Well I d put it on top of the school because then there would be more wind higher up Right and we have to worry about spacing right Because we were saying wind power is built usually where On wind farms where you have a lot of flat land Because if you build in a mountainous region are you going to get a lot of the wind If it s high enough it ll probably be enough Then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning or being damaged that way Yeah that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down Right that s very possible So when you think about one energy source is there really one energy source to go with Or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live what s available Because again talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water Is there running water everywhere around the United States No No And what s the problem if you flood an area even if there is a running water what happens if you flood the area Well they have to decide Usually if it s going to be a major problem they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things That s mostly our United States rule But in China they really don t care So they flood three or four cities multiple towns fill up three gorges of water Wow That s just insane Because once you disrupt water flow you have a problem So again there are some pros and cons to these Okay we re going to take a second and we re going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use So if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with whether there was running water think you have those things beside you don t limit yourself there but turn to your neighbor for a minute and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2 Because each one of you might have a different opinion Give each other a little bit of a reason why and we ll get back together in just a second Alright guys another 30 seconds Then we ll get back together Alright three two one Let s wrap up our conversations Alright How many people by show of hands went with one of the non renewable resources like coal oil or natural gas Cool So everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go Alright Ryan I think it s either wind or solar power How many people agree Oh so wind or solar is the clear choice Jonah why The thing is I think solar would be first Because solar energy you can use almost anywhere pretty much But the wind if you live here you can t get it as easily because there s not as much wind So it would be a lot easier to have solar because you can use solar anywhere because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere We think solar too because the sun is always there even if it is winter or it s a little cloudy the sun is still there Yeah but what about at night time So Maddy what did we find out about solar At night time like a lot of people go to work during the day so no one s at their house using their lights and stuff So there s a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house You still get some light at night bouncing off the moon Dustin what do you think I was thinking that solar energy would be great because I was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone and you have it plugged in and while it s plugged in it s fully charged and you can still use it and it won t un charge because it s still plugged into the wall But if the power goes out at your house then it will stop charging and you ll have that much battery left So it s kind of like if you re out in the day and your house is charging while there s still sun So you re still getting energy and at night time when the sun is gone you ll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing Well it s the same thing with wind power You d still have that battery there Yeah Wind power would be Would solar power still work during a storm It depends how severe the storm is So you mean this is like built to last Yeah if it gets struck by lightning I don t think it would still work But you know when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds right So that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day just at night you would still have to use the battery that s been stored Just like with wind power There is wind power all day long all night long but sometimes it does die down at certain times so there s a battery too there as well Exactly I agree with solar power but I agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things but I don t see the purpose of a solar farm It takes up a lot of land Just the point to collect the sun I think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant like wind power or something like that because And cost wise it would be probably expensive because it was 900 for just one of those panels And Miss Shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house That s basically about 10 800 For one house But we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines Just imagine random winter lines in your front yard Yeah but we saw pictures or a video of a solar powered house and most people don t like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house Same with the wind power wind turbines would look unattractive But you can still decorate them if you want You can t really do that with the wind power I mean solar power thing because it s mostly black That s a good thought So going forward thinking of an energy solution because as you guys get older energy is going to be something you have to worry about We ve seen the gas prices The gasoline prices for regular cars go up You ve seen the ethanol being developed Is it good to keep developing new technologies How many of you guys once you start driving think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you would drive a hybrid car I would Okay would you drive a hybrid car Yeah I would drive one because it s more in miles per gallon and with rechargeable cars you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money That s good Also the emissions from your gas
