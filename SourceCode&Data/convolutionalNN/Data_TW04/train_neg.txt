 Hi welcome to the library media center At the entrance we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings At our situation desk we have a suggestion box our series list and magazines and books to entice students as they check out In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners as well as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout For the teachers I have a professional library with over 3 000 books DVDs manipulatives and kits developed to support the curriculum Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library The paperbacks a student favorite arranged by genre just like in retail stores All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series I give special consideration to my reluctant reader s needs if students interests were looking for fiction or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels We have 13 desktop computers and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet numerous databases Impact and a variety of software On the school library website they find reviews blogs links to resarch sites as well as book suggestions trainers and podcasts many of which are created by the students On the left hand side of the library the reference and the non fiction sections are located Our many biographies are housed on the non fiction side of the center counter I have many displays throughout the library and around the school but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews or projects and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service But we don t we don t find our food and just like The three little pig wolf thing She counted all the way up And she wants to know the lines or something We re going to now that you guys have most of your categories filled in I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that s in front of you There are two reviews for this book Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews If you find something in common circle it on your graphic organizer I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews And again you can work with your partner on this one it talks about what they deserve and 30 more seconds That s okay Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked for and found in the story and what you find in the review Yes The review has some additional items in it doesn t it There are a lot of people with the same basic items Anyway I wanted to do a quick Venn diagram up here and compare and contrast I want for each group this group I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn t in the review Or one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper Okay Okay you guys I want you to find one for each of those groups I want you to find one thing that was in common So this is compare this is contrast Contrast compare Find one thing that was in common and one thing that s different Oh okay here s a sticky in the middle of the table I want you to write it on the sticky You guys hard Awesome step up here and tell us what it is and where does it go Awesome perfect So all you guys came up with a We did like don t count your chickens before they hatch and it was in our graphic organizer Oh okay Perfect and that was Good perfect Okay so everybody here found something that they had that wasn t in the review it was in their graphic organizer You guys come on up This table everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review We found Super Super so that goes in the middle because it s in common with both of them This group Perfect they found both in the review and in their organizer that So that was a What category Oh was that in common Did you find it in the review also or was it Just you guys found it So where would it go Excellent excellent That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn t in the review so it would go over here perfect Okay next We found that the Okay so you found something that was only in the review that the how the pigs disguised themselves Where do we put that on that Excellent something that was only found in the review Save the best for last What d you guys find We found that the graphic organizer and the review they both talked about that related to like the The allusions in there Wizard of Oz Three Little Pigs Excellent that was So we see an awful lot is in common with these Sometimes you guys find something that aren t in the reviews the reviews sometimes had something you didn t find They are a little bit different Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is You won t necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there and that s okay What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book and give a substantiated opinion of the book Why do What are the good features of this book What are the weaknesses in the book that you read Now there are other things that you may need in there and I ll show where you can get some additional information Let s bring this on down here In the online catalog Both of those computers are logged in over there Okay look up So far So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself Oh yeah that was a really long book or Oh that was a quick read That would be something to kind of jog your memory there Things like Oh yeah this was about Korea 
 Two times two Aggregating rules smaller the denominator the bigger the fraction That don t work sometimes I know what you re thinking Six eighths okay One two three Hey look Four five six You know it s like division too Yeah that s Okay six eighths Versus what Six eighths versus three fourths Okay One two three four five six They re equal they re equal One two three They re equal I just did that They re equal Wait wait wait Wait That s what I said didn t you hear me say that I said if you do equivalent fraciton It is Divide by two Can we do it the easy way Nah cause this is basically the easy way I mean look Okay what if we didn t have tiles What if we didn t have Imagine if we didn t have tiles We d have paper and pen People back in the days they never had colorful They didn t have a pencil neither Oh yeah well you know what I m talking about They had clay and a pointy stick All right so where s the paper You guys want to use a pen or pencil I already got one So who wants to go first I ll go first I will Okay group members I can t really explain it You can t really explain it Then show me If I said four tenths and one third Okay so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third looking at those fraction bars Because you add this and minus this It s It s one more than you need No because if you add one tenth to one third it s still going to be bigger Oh yeah All right but just looking at these two If I said one third and four tenths which one s bigger Four tenths Four tenths How do you know by looking at them Because Three four Like six Four tenths It s wider than one third Good it s wider than one third So now you guys just finished envelope number two and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two Who s turn is it to write Kayla Kayla s So why don t you read the group question for envelope number two Without using the fraction tiles how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half How could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half So what about that question How would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half Just like we told you it s because twelve well twelve six is half of Six twelve Yeah six twelve Is half of a twelve And five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths Okay very good What about what about five eighths is bigger than one half Israel what do you think How would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half Five eighths Yeah How could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half this question right here How would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half Because like more eighths one eighth is bigger than like one and like more it adds one half and one half So what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half Huh Which number which fraction with eight as the denominator would be equal to one half Four eighths Why do you say four eighths It s one half Can you show me with the fraction tiles Didn t you say not to use the fraction tiles I know but I want him to see that he s right that four eighths is equal to one half Okay guys okay good So then how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half It s one more one more you add to it You know that one eighths is equal to one half because they re like even numbers One eighth is equal to one half Four eighths four eighths That four eighths is equal to one half Okay All right guys keep on going Answer the questions for envelope number two and you guys can get started on envelope number three okay All right guys So you guys are on envelope number one Yeah We re done with envelope one we re just like answering this question You re doing what We re done with envelope one but we re answering it Okay so what is the question for envelope number one Anthony can you read it It is Someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third because the bigger the number the smaller the fraction Are they correct How would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect So that s something that I ve heard a lot of people in the class say That the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction Is that always true No No why Well because well the smaller the denominator that means like sometimes it could be like smaller smaller but sometimes I think like well actually You re doing good keep on going Well since like they re the whole Okay So like two pieces is two pieces one s shaving it all away and the other one is for So what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction How many pieces the thing is cut into How many pieces it s cut into What does a numerator tell us about a fraction How many are shaded How many are shaded So then why right here why right here is nine tenths so much bigger or bigger than one third Because it s close to one whole Because it s close to one whole And how could you explain it with what we just talked about Savannah Because it s 10 is the denominator and three is the other so if there s 10 that means there s 10 of the small pieces and there s nine of the small of those pieces But there s nine of those pieces So how many of those pieces are shaded in Nine Good And what about for one third How many pieces would we shade in for one third One Good All right guys well keep on going Keep on going you guys are doing well Try to answer these questions and then start with envelope number two okay All right guys keep going All right so which envelope are you guys on right now One we re answering the questions You re answering the questions Yeah and now I m writing it down Four So what did you say What did you actually say for the second question Oh we like if you just I m not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it but we just we all agreed that if you keep Simplifying simplifying a fraction into its lowest terms and if it can t go any lower than like then it s one half or one third you ll know if if it s equivalent to one half Or you can find a common denominator You can find a common denominator and that will allow you to do what To see if they re both the same number To see if they re both the same number Yeah Pretty much the same number Okay why don t you guys start envelope number two then Open up envelope number two and see how you order these on the fraction line Let s try one half first First three fourths Wait Wait Yeah three fourths goes right there five eighths goes right here No no it ll go right here Wait It goes right here So why don t you guys use the fraction bars then to figure it out Because I know three fourths is half of one Three fourths is Half of wait No it would be more It s half of It would be more It would be right here Wait I want you I want you to explain that a little bit better for me You said that three fourths is half of one half I mean one fourth is half of one half OK one fourth is half of one half so what about three fourths then And three fourths would go right here because two fourths is equal to one half and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half Right Also I was going to say that since we all know one half is right here three fourths would go in front of five eighths because one half of eight is four eighths and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths and then that s not the same Three fourths of eight would be six eighths Good And how do you know that four over four goes right over here Cause it s one it s one whole Wait No that would be the same place as three fourths Wait yeah that would be the same place Why would it be the same place Because Oh it is You said it s an equivalent fraction can you explain what they said Why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions Because they re the same Because because four times two is eight and three times two is six Okay And why does that make two fractions equivalent then Could you show me using fraction tiles I ll help you You can do this Four five six So how many of these do you need Six seven So what are you getting the six for I m getting eight six I already have six though Three fourths One two wait where are the fourths I believe right over oh Okay so show me show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths What do you notice We notice that they re the same length They re the same length And also we know that pretty much what Akosha said that if you multiply or if yeah if you multiply like if you multiply three times two and four times two it s six eighths because four times two is yeah four times two is eight and three times two is six Do you notice anything else about it here That two eighths equals one fourth Good Good All right guys let me see the rest of this Yeah How did you know that five twelfths was less than one half Go ahead Six is half of twelve and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths Okay Okay Why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths Cause like we don t that the smaller the denominator the bigger it is and so one fourth would be in the middle So that would be on the other side of one fourth Okay All right guys keep on going You re doing good We ve over It s over So which one are you guys on now Four but we need help with one of the questions on three Five no we need help on number four Let s look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on then We re not We just have a question on what it is A conjecture A conjecture So conjecture is something that we we ve talked about before in math If it says What conjecture it s kind of like what a hypothesis is in science 
 This is a classroom where I push in for language arts This is a morning meeting area and this is also the area where any whole group instruction would take place Over here is the area that the assistant sits and works with children and does phonemic awareness activities Here is a word wall and where the students keep their folders with their reading books in it their book boxes Here is where the classroom teacher does word study This is the independent work station And here is where I sit and I m responsible for the reading instruction This is where the guided reading groups meet This is a little reading area over here Where the students can do some independent reading You know what Jane told me to do that I liked also Looking at the word and chunking are good things to do Jane said go back and reread and make sure it sounds right and makes sense And that s something Jesus I want us to start practicing a little more When we get to a word that tricks us Put the book flat Sarah please We want to go back and reread and check and make sure it makes sense Okay here s something else I want us to do today with this book Rascal I want us to think about what happened in the story today And we re going to do it this way I want all eyes up here We re gonna use this wipe board It s a big wipe board It is and you have a little one And you will probably get a chance to use it too But first I m gonna write on the big one Okay The first word up here Jesus I m gonna ask you to help me read it I m gonna chunk it because you know the first part of this word Child Some Okay Jesus is gonna help us Okay Jesus go ahead and help me read this word Some Can you try body Somebody good job You see how he broke that into chunks Do you see that Jane Somebody Let s think about the story Hands down I want you to think about the question before you put your hand up Somebody Somebody s in the story Who is the somebody Who is this story mostly about Kelly s gonna help us Kelly who s this story mostly about Put your hand down Sarah I think is Josie s taking Rascal to the vet You re right Josie s taking Rascal to the vet So who are we talking about in the story Are we talking mostly about Rascal or are we talking mostly about the vet Hands down let her think She ll ask for help if she needs it Who do you think the story s mostly about Um Rascal Rascal I agree Thumbs up if you agree Thumbs up if you agree Sarah do you agree I agree do you agree You do I see a thumbs up Okay So what did you want to say about the title of the story Maybe the story was mostly about Rascal because the title Jackie did you hear what Sarah said She said that s some good thinking Sarah She said she also knew it was mostly about Rascal because the title was in it I knew it was mostly about Rascal because I read the story and they talked about Rascal a lot in the story Rascal Rascal Okay Rascal s in the story Alright Rascal now there s a problem At the very beginning of the story and I m gonna go back in the book and look and see what it is Sarah what s a problem in the very beginning of the story I read the words and it said he didn t want to go in the door to see the vet He didn t want to go to the vet Why do you think he didn t want to go to the vet Jackie How come Why do you think Rascal didn t want to go to the doctor Let s listen to what Jackie says Cause he s scared He s scared How did you know that he s scared Jackie I agree How did you know that Because the picture shows he s looking like he s upset or sad And I like how Sarah said she read in the story Eddie she read that he didn t want to go to the vet Turn the page I see other things happening I m gonna ask you about that in a minute Okay so somebody is Rascal And Rascal the problem is he didn t want to go Rascal didn t want you know what Kelly come up here and help me write Cause you can write the rest of what I m gonna write Come up here Didn t Oh I m gonna do the want part Didn t want Rereading helps me think about what I want to write Rascal didn t want what To go Can you write to go Don t forget to space Rascal didn t want to go to let s have a bigger space Rascal didn t want to go to the I like how you re all looking to see You re good that s fine Just keep going Good thank you Rascal didn t want to go to the Who wants to try vet Sarah you want to try That s a word we haven t written before But I know that she can think about the sounds in it and I bet you she can do it Good job Thank you Sarah Okay Rascal didn t want to go to the vet But but what Eddie but what He didn t want to go But He went and he was scaring the animals Oh my goodness Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared the animals Hold on a minute Jane cause I know you re gonna help me But he went anyway Hold on one second then you can tell me and scared should we say I m thinking about how this should sound I m thinking about what happened in the story but he went anyway and scared the other animals or other animals or the animals He did scare cats who else did he scare the mouse Can I have a quiet hand for someone else He scared the cat the mouse Jackie who else did he We can always let Jackie help Let Jackie help let s look Jackie let s go back and look And you re looking at the pictures Jackie s gonna help us Jackie I see the cat that Jane said What other animal do you see in the picture that he scared the parrot and the rabbit Oh okay the parrot and the rabbit Okay he went anyway and scared a rabbit I m gonna put this mark here cause I have a couple things I m saying a cat and I don t have room here so I need to erase this word so I have room to keep writing He went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and what s the last thing I need to say Kelly And a what Parrot Parrot And I wanted to say Okay what did you want to say I want to say that I really know about these I know their names they call commas You re right thank you Kelly helped me because I didn t say what these were called She reminded us that those are called commas Thank you Kelly Okay one moment Jane I want us to think about the story and I want us to think about what s happening Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot So we have a big problem we need to find a solution We need to find a solution What is our solution to the problem Sarah Can you sit on your bottom so you don t fall and hurt yourself my solution is that at the end of the story right here he goes in to the vet so he doesn t scare the other animals Okay I like how all of you went back to check the solution and you went back in the story to help you understand what happened Jane I like what Sarah said and I m thinking about how I can write that Sarah was looking at this page and she saw how he went into the vet and now he won t scare the other animals Okay Can I read this page Yes and in fact Jane wants to read it and she s gonna I want all of us to read it with our eyes because I want us to listen to how that sounds with those dark parts the author said Go ahead Jane are you ready I love how that sounded and I saw you were practicing that too Kelly Let s all practice that to ourselves The big dog growled grrrrr Rascal ran Jesus how did she know How did Jane know to say Rascal ran How did she know to read it like that The author wrote it in dark and big He wrote it in dark and big he sure did And he said something else Eddie that I want you to look at He wrote it dark and big and what else did he put there at the end Remember what that mark s called It s a big fancy long word That s okay Sarah s gonna help us This mark right here Eddie is what we re talking about Comma Nope but it looks Somebody that s talking Yes and when they re loud go ahead Sarah An exclamation mark Yeah That word is a very long word and it s new to us Eddie so we re learning it Do you wanna try and say it after me Exclamation mark yeah That shows they re excited You mean this Yeah Oh I though you were this Oh well no wonder I was tricking you by accident I m so sorry Eddie Yes I was talking about the exclamation mark Okay Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot And so the end of the story should say that it s a solution Sarah was He ran into the vet What made him Why did he run Because he was scared Of what the dog Jesus did you hear what Sarah said So let s think about that But but he saw a what Big dog Come over here and help me write Me and Jesus are gonna write this together Come on over here Jesus Lemme move this out of your way I m sorry Okay go over here And turn around so everyone can read come over by me But he you can write the word he Go ahead Write it under here Thank you Now I m gonna help you give me the marker Jackie I need you to look over here so you can help us if we need it Go stand over here for a second But he oops he saw you go ahead a a what He saw a what Jackie he saw a what A big dog A big dog And those are words you know go ahead Now come down here so we don t go too far up Dog Oops something s tricking you Go ahead and turn that around Thank you go ahead give me the marker back Thank you Hold on But he saw a big dog and what happened What happened Sarah He Yeah ran And he ran Okay come over and help me write that then please Come on over over here And he ran Good Go ahead and sit down and he ran where Into the vet Okay I m gonna just finish this And he ran in Into is easy because you know both of those parts And he ran into the into the vet Or into the vet s What s that place Let s put that office or room Let s put room But both of those are good choices 
 Inner circle number two Again this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we re going with this Why did the accident happen The accident of May 10th 1996 Why did it happen Any questions Yes the May 10th 1996 thank you for clarifying where everybody died well not everybody but a lot of people died Why did it happen Because Okay so I think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren t prepared for for the climb They thought it was going to be they re just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn t expect the challenges that they were going to face I agree They probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park Turns out that they weren t ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain You were talking about they weren t prepared and all that But they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn t normal And I was kind of taken aback by that because I was like if there s a guide who s going to be guiding me on a life threatening thing I would want them to be seasoned trainer you know Exactly I would think the same thing That the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew I agree with all of you but during reading the article Krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn t really anyone s fault because people were so not in their right minds They were tired and injuries and how thin the air was they couldn t breath very well So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming they didn t expect it to be as bas as it was so nobody could really prevent it Anything to add to that I agree and I think that they were just having so much fun that they weren t really paying attention I think that they would ve all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds I know you mentioned the clouds but why weren t they watching them Why do you think they weren t watching them they didn t think that they were actually serious enough to actually I agree with Matt that they were so they wanted to get to the top so much they weren t too worried about looking at the clouds Oh okay we can make it back up and make it back down maybe before Not expecting trouble along the way Yeah I agree I think that they weren t really prepared They were too wrapped up in what was going on to think about the downfall and what was happening They re tired and probably weak they didn t have safe they weren t really all there to think about what are the consequences of this and what would happen Like the guide if it were me I would have made sure they had this that you re gonna help me out more than not really being able to Anything you wanna say Krystin Well I said that this quote at the top it says that Ambition has a steep price And I think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren t too prepared and weren t qualified but I think that well and the author mentions this too that climbing this mountian is it s taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when you re putting your life on the line there s nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive it s just basically putting your life to chance and so that s what I really got out of it what do you think I agree I think that then not as many people would ve died They should just listen to what they re told and and not risk their lives to do something that I agree with that No but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and I agree but I think it s understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely cool and I would definitely want to go up there soon as possible and not worry about the weather like go all in or don t go at all I agree with lost or injured I mean but I m like half way there go ahead and accomplish what I set out to do and I think that would ve caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we re doing I agree with what Ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest I mean it says that they caught about safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life One thing I noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn t go back and check themselves and I didn t understand why they didn t go back and and like when the one guy says there s no oxygen here there s no full tanks Why didn t they go back and check that themselves I mean I would trust that person but yet again if my life on the line I would be checking it Does anyone else think the same way If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other people I d be a little weary about something like that I don t so much disagree but I came up with something a little bit different I didn t really think that people relied on each other that much at all Who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain In a way I would say that it was selfish mission but in another way I mean if it was my own life I would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think we saw that at least I saw that a lot happen throughout the story It s a choice between am I going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this does it matter Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive Some people were relying on others like at the end someone was trying to help was trying to help he tried to help her down she grabbed his arm and he tried to pull her down But she just let go and died I agree with Erin too I mean I think that right now wouldn t be able to You would think about yourself more Whenever you re out there and and you re with the same people for that long of a time and you re doing the same thing that you become sort of closer They would mean more to you then than they do right now You d be more willing to sacrifice something to survive to help them give them another chance to get out alive too That s definitely shown at the end of the article when he s talking about how he can t live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost and how he couldn t even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time I agree with Erin I think there was a lot of at the end I think he was talking about the there was a lot of blame involved and why couldn t we prevent this and it brings me back to what you guys said I think they really wanted to help each other and I think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases I thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn t prevent someone s terrible death Tyler what do you think about this Like did he grieve or even just the fact that who they were relying on Well what strikes me All right outer circle what d you notice What d you notice I noticed that people were and books and just kind of in inner circle and I felt that that really helped them to get the instructions Okay Blake what did you notice I just thought that it was more and more like Erin really led the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and I think that those were like the two main ones but like Levi and Elliot and Alex they all also communicated a lot but there wasn t just one person who was talking Okay so there were definitely two leaders but there were other people that were contributing as they went along Okay good Anthony There were some well developed conversations Well developed conversations what do you mean by that Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic Yeah did you notice what was the question they started with Yeah we got a little off topic No you didn t What what was the question you started with What caused the disaster And then you went into something totally different but did you have good conversation about that Absolutely You guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life Okay I really like how I mean it wasn t like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing Mount Everest It was definitely very connected to what you were saying Dorothy what d you notice I noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn t stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another Right it kept bouncing from one thing to another You could see like steam coming out of your ears they were all impulsive Blake I thought that also remember Erin said you re relying on someone and Krystin s like well I don t agree backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there was people who didn t Yeah Is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you Absolutely But you need to do it respectfully Like Krystin did Krystin said I don t exactly agree with you Erin then she proceeded to say Why And Levi was over here he was nodding his head and shaking yeah All right great I thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses they always had something someone would pass on to someone else They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses You guys ever heard that before It wasn t a pregnant pause it wasn t a big spacey gap okay Anthony Pretty much everyone talked Pretty much everyone talked Yeah pretty much Yeah did you notice that They built on to what other people were saying okay They agreed I still heard I agree a lot but then they told us why they agree with what they said All right Anything else you guys noticed Yes I think that we looked at our more because they had wider subject that they talked about Eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details It wasn t the whole story it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that All right Anything else 
 Well you know what especially after Mrs Bennett taught you the three things she wanted you to do in reading by having you look around the room and skip around the room and flip on the carpet we thought Oh boy that Nathan really needs to do something hands on And I know from you being in Reading Recovery that when you heard a book twice you practically knew it I mean you knew the story You could go somewhere and tell it right Yep When you read the book is it easy for you to retell it What is it like to retell a story that you just read Not so easy for me cause I had to pick up a book look at it for a minute and then I pop it and then I know it Okay if I read a story to you would you be able to go tell it to someone else Yes Okay But right next to me Okay Okay All right well these are the things we re gonna practice And because we don t want to leave out the visual style of learning because it s also an important way to get information we re gonna focus on the auditory and the kinestetic the hearing and the hands on type learning and we re also gonna include some visual so that it will strengthen that part for you But we wanna make sure we re getting you where your strength is Because you are fantastic at listening and doing hands on activities Oh you have a plan in your mind about what kind of castle you re gonna build It s not a castle It s gonna be like when I see that in movies Like a tower like where the Egypt Egyptites The Egyptians Yeah Like a pyramid Yeah Okay cool All right Would you like some extra things like maybe some games or some extra things you can do to help you remember in class Yeah because my teacher she gives us free games like learning games in our math book There s math games and you have to put your thing on it and you have to guess who much it is And if you get it right you stay on there Okay cool Well I want to add some games like that that you re gonna And we re gonna add some things that you can do to help you remember directions in class and remember what Miss Smithson has asked you to do Cause one of the things that I ve noticed is that when Miss Smithson gives you two or three directions you ll start one and then you forget what the other ones are And you re like Ugh what do I do now Yeah because my brain it has so much stuff and because if I get more it kind of breaks the other stuff And you know I wasn t gonna talk about this yet but by you saying that your brain has so much stuff I wanted to remind you about do you know what good listening looks like Uh huh What do good listeners look like Their hands are crisscrossed with their hands in their lap and wherever the teacher goes they keep their eyes on em Okay and then if you have a comment if I say Would anyone like to ask a question or make a comment about what we re learning Let s say I just taught you about Clemson Football Or I like hockey That s my favorite Okay let s say we were learning about hockey The equipment used in hockey okay So if I asked you to either ask me a question or make a comment about what we re learning would you tell me the names of some of the hockey equipment that you know of Or would you ask me a question about a piece of hockey equipment that you ve seen but you don t know what it s called Or would you tell me a story about how you really like hockey Hmmm how I really like hockey I knew you d say that You always do that You remember one of things that Miss McGinnis taught you in Reading Recovery And one of the strengths this is what I love about you one of the things that a lot of people have trouble with when they re reading is that they can t relate what they re reading to themselves or to their lives You are absolutely fantastic with that Fantastic If there s a story of a dog and I have a dog and my dog did the same thing Right So since you re so good at that though sometimes I think that that is one of the things that gets your mind off on on Hey my dog did that Instead of on exactly what your teacher s wanting you to do So one of the things about being a really good listener is to remember what comments and what statements and what questions are necessary for what you re learning And which comments and questions should wait for later even though they re zinging around in your head okay So if I m doing a whole class lesson about different colored fur on dogs and I say Can anyone think of a color that a dog s fur might be What would be a comment you could make Black and brown cause that s what my dog is made out of Okay black and brown All right let s say somebody says blonde somebody else says white and then somebody raises their hand and they say Well I don t know what all colors dogs can be but my dog Sandy is really pretty Is that a comment that is necessary for what we re talking about No Okay so that s one of the things that you can practice And I love your stories and I know Miss Smithson does too And you have a lot of kids and grownups in this school that feel really close to you and we feel like we have a good relationship with you because you do share things about yourself Yeah but I only do that at the beginning of the day the end of the day and at writing Cause I write down the things in writing Good well then I m glad Miss Smithson is also working on this with you because as much as I want to know about you I don t want it to distract you from what it is you re supposed to be thinking about Okay Okay Three more blocks Okay let s talk about some of the things that we re gonna put in place for you okay A couple of em I m pretty excited about okay We re gonna work on your memory with reading and in general with classwork so that when someone tells Nathan what to do Nathan s gonna be able to remember it Instead of getting distracted and thinking Huh I have no idea what I m supposed to do next Yeah because in my class there s some kids Zachary and Brody and the two new kids they re talking in the back And that s can be very distracting can t it Okay do you know how to focus Do you know how to tune people out What do you do when you re distracted in the classroom I just turn around and go like this Okay do you think you know how to tune people out without having to tell them to stop What if you knew they were gonna talk no matter what but you still needed to listen Could you I could do this to block their sound Okay you could That kinda reminds me of the bat we were talking about for some reason It s kinda like you re directing your hearing at one place And sometimes I push it to what I m hearing at So then when I do that in my mouth I can hear it more good without noises from the construction site that s near our house I can focus on it Okay I think that s fantastic what you ve just said You make a conscious effort to focus on what you re trying to hear That what I want you to do when you notice that other people are talking behind you Instead of worrying about what they re doing I want you to focus on what you need to be hearing I want you to stop and think I m not gonna listen to them I m gonna listen to Miss Smithson Okay And see if that helps Just like you strain to hear the construction noises okay All right we re gonna do some fun things with you that I think you re gonna like First of all I know you love video games So one of the things that we ve tried before that doesn t seem to be working very well is Odyssey And I know that when you get on Odyssey you like to choose the math games over the reading games Probably just Why do you choose math over reading Cause I wanna get more math so then I can just focus on reading cause if I m really smart at math I can just drop it so I know everything I know sweetheart It s a lot more fun to do something that you re really good at So we re gonna change up your computer program Instead of having you work on Odyssey during the day instead of Odyssey you re gonna work on a new program called Earobics And it s supposed to be super helpful with your reading skills And Mrs Price the speech teacher whose office is across the hall she said it is really fun and that she knew kids at Griggs Road that did it and they loved it okay So we re gonna try Earobics So we re gonna keep a computer game for you but we re gonna try one that hopefully is gonna work better to help your reading skills come up instead of Odyssey Okay All right The next thing we re gonna do is we re gonna give you a little tape recorder Have you ever had a tape recorder No and I haven t even seen one I know a lot of people don t use tape recorders anymore Most people can record things on their phone and all kinds of gadgets Well I had when I was little I had this little thing and it had a recorder When I would sing a song into the microphone I could record it and then play it to my friends Okay well we re gonna do something like that We re gonna have you if Mrs Smithson is giving directions and then you guys are getting ready to do an assignment or group work or whatever it is she wants you to do she s gonna come over and she s gonna give the directions to you You get to press record on your tape recorder and say the directions yourself into the tape recorder Then you get to stop it and play it back and hear yourself saying the directions Okay Unless you need them we re gonna have you put the little tape recorder away so that it doesn t bother you Like maybe in a pocket behind your seat or something And then only if you get stuck and you think Hmm what did Miss Smithson want me to do can you get out that recorder and listen Yeah or I can have it recording beside me so I could record everything and if I still remember it like it s so easy I can remember it I can just erase it Okay But I think the actual act of hearing it whole group with the rest of the kids in your room hearing it with just Miss Smithson telling it you saying it again yourself and then hearing what you said that may be all you need You may not have to listen to it again I think just making sure you re really concentrating on what the directions are is gonna be a really good thing for ya Okay also oop I gotta get something from over here Okay One of the other things we might do is maybe Miss Smithson might tell you something like give you a direction and she s gonna whisper it in your ear and then you have to whisper it to the person beside you And they re gonna whisper it to the person beside them and it s gonna go around the table until it gets back to you How many of you all sit at one group Five or six I think it s gonna be five cause we got two more kids Okay so sometimes Miss Smithson might say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay So then you have to whisper that into the ear of the person beside you What would you say Get out your pencil and get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay and then that person would have to whisper it to them Then it s gonna come all the way around and then the last person s gonna say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 60 Is that right I ll just turn back to em and say It s 50 It s 50 Okay okay That s another way we might make sure that we understand the directions before we get started Sometimes my teacher she just writes it on 
 Glue Here we are Compression is really Compression is really getting it Hey guys what ya doin Adding our stuff to this Oh I ve been trying to tell you that this bridge holds one kilogram without breaking A thousand grams Wow That s really good That s probably why you want us to have a railing Uh huh So it doesn t just slide off That s true you do want to keep something on the bridge Well that s very good And we re thinking about it bends a lot so we could do this It s really bendy bendy And you just broke it Don t break it The last time she just dropped it and it splattered all over the place Okay so this is the roadway Yes Okay and then what s going to hold this up We re trying to figure out everything If we get all the pieces and then trying to see what we can do to add it all together Do we have um wait a minute guys we could have one of the railings on the front and the bottom The top and bottom Stick Cause I was thinking we could put this on the bottom Guys like if we had one on the top and bottom like on the movie it would hold it down and up at the same time keeping it flat Hey you know what we could do We could make kind of like a T shape and then bend the top of the stick and then glue it on that way What would you glue that to You say you re bending it into a T shape okay so you d have a T shape Go like Okay Try to bend that Hand me a book we need to put more compression I learned by that idea if I put a book on it it would keep the glue down and it would keep it compressed We need more compression let s get a couple of books Here s another one Also put a kilogram on it Yes you did put a kilogram on it that s true I mean like on there Oh okay So this rail that you have over here that s a truss And as soon as we add this Is that going to be under or above the railway We were deciding to go above Cause it has to have a railing and then below is optional Okay but how is it going to get attached We were trying to figure out that Okay Now we just keep going Okay I will come back and check on you all right Okay give me a couple Popsicle sticks so I can put it underneath Will we put them underneath the thing Oh dang dang dang It s hard because these right here but only two places are touching Oh I see what you mean I don t think it s overlapping because there s the one in between I was just making sure okay Yeah I see what you re saying but I kinda think they work because this is really only touching this and here it touches this one but it s not like it s continuously touching from here to here I was just making sure sheesh you guys Why don t you all tell me more about your bridge Well it s kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge I mean beam bridge Okay can you sit up We re continuing to make our arch but we have run into a problem Okay We decided we re going to put glue on top of here to fill in some of the cracks that we had It would act like cement but we forgot that when glue dries it contracts So the bridge has kind of curled Guys guys Logan we re not in your group we re okay Also I was thinking when we did the arch it might need support under the bottom but the triangle might be a little odd cause it would stand on this end part We could do what we did here Can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be Well I was thinking we could just like bend it and put it on that I m going to test this on the weights We need two kilograms if you can get it Now how long is your bridge Have you measured your bridge Our bridge is Are you doing it in metric or in customary We re doing it in customary Customary okay It s 55 cm or 22 inches and 2 cm Okay we re not going to mix measurements It s like 22 and a half inches Okay So if you had 12 is that 12 plus 9 Yeah So 21 and a half maybe Yes Okay You guys I got the two 200 kilogram things so we could Gram I said gram 200 grams It will be heavier than the glue bottle And that way we can use the glue Okay so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go The arch is going to be above the roadway No because here you can t fit two cars but it will go smoothly for the rest of it Like we made it so two cars would go right next to each other like we didn t think we could leave the extra space Right but they might take off each other s rear view mirrors Right We ran into that though What could you do about that We don t really know because all of this stuff is dry so far it s holding up quite well Well what if this was only one lane What if you made another one just like it to be the other lane That would be perfect But it would take a good long while No it wouldn t We built this in a couple of days Yeah we could glue it together with like these Yeah okay Perfect Thanks Miss Hoyle All right guys let s start working on that one So are these the same size as these Let s try to make it more even this time Making that is going to take like 50 days We need 50 of these guys right Tell me a little bit about this arch and what it s going to do As you build the arch how is that going to keep your bridge steady Well it s like when the arch gets pulled on it s gonna be secured here so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension it s going to go a little bit like it is now Okay it s going to pull it away A little bit Which means I ve got to get the weight on it So it s going to create the outward thrust Yeah Which with an outward thrust what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge if you have an outward thrust Remember Oh it s uh Abutments do you remember that Yeah You need that something over here to take the force the pressure that s being exerted from the center outward the outward thrust I have a thing with that one it hates me I hate it So have you tried laying your bridge across a 20 inch span Yeah we did it on a desk It caved in a little in the middle but when our arched is finished it ll actually help Tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle The important thing is what we did was we put glue in between in to act like cement to keep it together Uh huh Well that made it curl a little bit and so it was a little weaker in the middle because that s where it was starting to bend And also partially because it s it s We don t have a lot of support on the bottom which makes the um its tension affected I kind of suggested triangles at the bottom but we haven t really done that yet Yeah that s because we haven t got the arch up yet Oh you mean on the bottom of the bridge Yeah That s a good idea Well we need to start working on it All right well I ll leave you alone and I ll come back and check on you later okay Guys we ve got four of these We need a lot more All right then well let s get going I m going to keep working on the arch okay Wait wait wait that was part of the arch support The first arch needs to get worked on Could you guys make the second road and I ll continue on the arch It needs to get to get built This idea isn t working Maybe we should try to like add this on here so that it doesn t like fall Oh okay And that way the arch will stick to the top and this arch will stick to the bottom Do you girls want to try that Sure sure Also I think it will hold maybe a little better because Nicky it s not all like This is just like that it s still gonna kind of it s still going to kind of stick to this even if we had this idea it d be like that it won t exactly hold that very well Show me how it s going to be touching like this onto there I think yeah well like Like that this way Yeah but like with this on top so like that and then this at the bottom Okay It will hold better now Actually this is the right way here right Yes It s like that okay Yes and then we also figured out um when there s going to be 1000 grams on there it broke in half Oh no This part it kinda snapped It can hold 500 Yeah it can hold 500 It can hold 500 grams Yes and 200 And 200 grams Yes so I don t Oh you tried 700 grams also Yes Okay So that s not bad It kinda snapped here but yeah so um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the like underneath Okay the piers We should add the piers in the middle seriously Well yeah we can add it like side middle and side I feel like we should do it like bang one on that side and one on the other Yeah but it s still with the one on top Yeah Yeah We definitely want it Want it to hold Yeah definitely Yes All right I want to see what s going on over here Right now working on the railing Okay And Molly s doing that by she gluing she s working on the sidewalk right now we re almost done with the railing Okay And what Molly s doing right now is she is we re gluing two popsicle sticks together like this Okay And uh we re going to glue them against here Okay So they can we re probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle so they glue together easily Glue them right here to the side Okay And then we re going to put the railing on the side of this so like on this side like this and then the railing will be on this side so that ll the railing is three inches Brooke said Right So we re almost done with our bridge stuff at this Would it be helpful to work from the bottom to glue the pedestrian bridge would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom Yeah probably would And even though it bends it s bent it s really really strong Uh huh It can hold more than a kilogram Oh that s wonderful Now did you um what kind of force what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle Um it s compression and tension Tension is pushing it out like this making the sides curl up and then the compression is what makes the bridge Okay so you re going to compensate for that like this So are these your trusses No these are the railings We thought that it would act like a truss Okay Even though we re not going to have one going on the bottom They re going to be on the top It s all going to be on top And you did try laying it across a 20 inch gap We measured it to make sure it s 20 inches Okay good well do want to try measuring a 20 inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it not while it s wet but when it s dry See what it s like What are you doing Molly I m gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk and then when it s dry I m going to get them to go together like that Okay and then I m going to take my railing How s that going to attach With another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk And then just attach the whole thing to the bridge as one piece Okay I was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top connecting the two railings together with popsicle sticks at the top Like a covered bridge Yeah So this is for a crab run bridge is that what it s called Yes That s a real bridge that needs to be replaced isn t it Yes And we ve actually figured out what s it s going to be replaced by Oh okay you found it on the internet It s actually it s um a beam bridge But it s not over water it s over rough terrain Okay And it s in Highland County it s way to the It s northwest 
 Can you think of what what images are coming into your head about the Holocaust that relate to this Um people dying in the gas chambers Okay and and how did that happen He convinced other people that they were awful and then that s really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that Okay so you re saying Hitler couldn t have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the Jewish people were what Nothing They were just less than just a lesser race of people You re on a good track I ll check back with you in a second by stepping on another group of people So the other groups would actually help them Like we have to remember that the injustice the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it s not just injustice anyway you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing Well outside people like in Atlanta and Birmingham like in there like in Birmingham were being persecuted while people in Atlanta weren t really doing anything Well I mean look what s happening today I mean we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in Afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what Martin Luther King did for Alabama So you re saying you see a connection in the real world news That sort of our soldiers the fact that they volunteer would be an example for number five Is that what you are saying Yeah Had y all talked about number five yet Uh we were just going in order and seeing which ones that we could And yours is read me your quotation Um Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere Okay good Well you re just being to come up with things Okay go ahead I m just going to Okay so what s the first question Explain the context in which um Martin Luther King said this and how it applies in that situation Okay He doesn t want people to sit back and not do anything about a problem he wants them to go and help and stop It s almost as if their problem is his problem Is his problem Good I like that But even though he wants them to help well he doesn t want them to do it in a violent way Always need to underguard MLK with that don t we And that sort of ties into It s wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends Do you find yourself as you re discussing any one of these the others layer on there Yeah That s why it feels so important to have gotten this whole document as a whole Think you ve gotten enough from them Brianna for that one Yeah I think so Well I guess Clyde s already said that there s already one for the current news Yeah that we could put down So the volunteer soldiers Volunteer army Volunteer army I ll check back with y all good job are they more reluctant to like um listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it Yeah I think that s it Okay so in Watership Down the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior how do you spell that because I think I spelled that before privileges Privileges You know what to be honest with you every time I am typing I let spell check do it because that d and g always messes me up I was spelling superiority Superiority I m sorry Okay so what group have you chosen Colleen and what what Uh privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals And I hear that you re using a Watership Down example which My idea Your idea good for you And what is the um what Warren are we talking about The very first one um Sandleform Sandleform yeah Yeah go ahead and tell me about that Yeah it s like um the higher class rabbits didn t want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies Does that make sense to you India That s a good example I really like it Okay have you gotten anything else Um we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies What was the time in history Bish Um Number two Where this quotation applies is the Holocaust Um during Nazi rule people felt better about discriminating against the Jews because many others were also doing it So what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges Um actually I think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights Right so the whole group of what The whole group of um Nazis the Nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis But maybe they wouldn t have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality is that kind of where we are with this Yes Good well y all go ahead I m just going to watch a minute So I ll finish writing the Watership Down one the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to how about admit that some of the lower Number four would be easier to connect to a teenager s life that one actually fits for both of those What does Um for telling a time in a teenager s life um both of these the two parts of the quote would apply because it s like when you re getting like verbally abused it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual So if there s a whole group picking on you then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily So say say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who s sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there so they ask Hey you don t have to sit over at our table but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day They ll probably say No because they won t think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left And they don t want to go by the garbage cans Nobody wants to I think that s a good connection A good very present day connection Good I ll be back Yes of course Um Allison would you like to I have no clue would it be okay to write about like how people in foreign countries use like the sex trade as an it an I it relationship Certainly Mr Gallant s class We just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down That s okay that s okay that seems very real to me Okay fictional things so if it s fictional it doesn t have to be people I didn t say that we could use um what s that Watership Down I said we could use that did I not All right let s see Okay whatever I said we can use Hazel and the Warren for oppressed people that are not But I think we should do Efrafa because the bunnies like revolted and they got free remember Yeah That s what I m thinking I m hearing an argument where both of you think Watership would be a good connection but we re debating which what Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever Which Warren would like be better I think Efrafa Which one did you say Um the first one that came to from what was it called Sandleford Sandleford Okay tell me why you think that Because they were they had freedom but it was like they were just they couldn t do what they wanted all the time They could just do certain things in a certain vicinity They couldn t go out or go anywhere and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they um like revolted against their Warren and left What were you going to add Michael Oh like it was like a routine everyday like it was the same thing they followed like a routine like they went out and then ate and then slept But I think Efrafa is like that except for it s a lot worse like they didn t even get to go out like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed like right here and they d have to go right back into their Warren I think they re both good examples but I think Machi s is more able to be explained by that because they did but in his you know uh uh Hazel and Big Wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for They eventually got what they wanted In Efrafa they didn t get what they wanted until someone came in to And not everybody in Efrafa got out But not everyone in um Sandleford got out most of them didn t But I mean the group that we re talking about the main But the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted where they wanted Because no one else would listen Let me tell you something the main reason we re doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing will inform our later life It doesn t make me sad that you have two examples because when it s a little bit wrong or when it s a lot wrong because when you notice it when it s a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong so it kind of pleases me that you re seeing it at two different levels so I think use Efrafa and Sandleford and you ll have the best answer Okay Okay what are we working on We are trying to debate whether we should pick Cuba or Egypt as current events for for privileged groups so we can get Well let s hear your arguments Cuba Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for Metaphorically he s about to die He s still in power okay Egypt s been resolved already No Well they re arguing that it s not in the news but it s going on right now Well I think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we ve like talked about in class that s really really really And we all understand it What don t you understand about Cuba though Like there s nothing that s really in the news right now Cuba they still have the same old thing just like every other country that s happened just a little bit worse Here s what I m hearing You have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the Egypt example and it doesn t dis uh disvalue yours because it s important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he s talking about apathy when it s happened for a long time people don t less and less and less revolt Okay Could we possibly do Cuba in the history one Oh I think you could Work on that that s a great idea How are we coming Good we re done Good done I think we are finished I want to hear your uh everyday life one All right our for our teenager Yes All right we re saying like if there s a group of popular kids and they re like calling names and putting down a group of the not so popular kids and they re just not treating them like they re normal people too they re just treating them like lesser people Less than human They might they might not pay attention to them also they just In the way you wouldn t necessarily recognize a theme but in a way you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being Okay great So I want you as you re looking back over yours make sure that you ve given your reader or your listener enough information My shortest one was like three sentences and there s nothing magic about the number of sentences just check yours because you re a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there s any details you could add Okay great How are we coming Um good Pretty much done Awesome awesome You ve got three of the four Which ones did you do Um the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life And your quotation was Oh we did um it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons Thank y all for choosing that one that s a very hard one And we put And the third one great Now will some body tell me what your fictional one was Um we did why don t you explain this one Isabelle Okay I did Peter Pan Uh huh Cause when Peter Pan he persuades or he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them but he s doing it for the wrong reasons What reasons do you think he s really doing it To have a mother for the children the lost children And so he s not really thinking of their well being he s thinking of his and the lost boys well being Right What a great connection I m so proud of y all That s awesome And did you do news Uh we did history History what s your historical one Uh we did uh when the Europeans 
 What you just said They re going to go back together Well I ve glued them down so they can t The green and the red charts are locked down in place They can t get back but I ve taken up the orange field Wouldn t it generate a new field They re going to make a new field and that new field will be Say it again Oh like the earlier drawing We can actually say a little more than that In this vicinity here They ll be trying to pull each other back together So we re going to end up with a field that s exactly opposite What we did was they move around As long as it s still running They move apart until the field is basically nullified Let s look at one more example Do you have one more potato shape in there Most people Most people right So let s start for this last one let s look at this shape and say that I observe fields coming out like that Write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction Based on what you re seeing in there what can you say about what you see Are those lines all supposed to be straight Yeah To the best of my drawing ability they re horizontal parallel lines My drawing was perfect Mr Shields what They re going in two directions The orange Yeah the orange one Like a very large plate It could be just a potato in there and that s The thing in your hand This one Yep Okay let s take a look Chris can I get you to shut the door to keep the noise down We ll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so It s nice to have the extra period here First thing before we talk about this new one I failed to address Hannah s question and good insight earlier Yes The orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they re going to bend and will be coming outward from the positive end So you re definitely going to see this sort of pattern I think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations Anytime you ve got a conducting material Anytime you ve got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with It s a conductor So it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field Let s talk about this new one There s a couple of observations Ian give me one observation and Claire give me the second observation Besides the fact that the lines are straight No that s a good one The lines are straight Very important Claire They re going in opposite directions Exactly opposite directions Okay Hakim give me another one Well the lines are coming out of it Okay they re coming outward not inward Good To indicate that the Okay so that one we know from the very first piece here The net charge is positive The fact that they re horizontal They indicate like a plate or something Yeah is it like two parallel plates Two parallel plates So where would you draw them Above and below There are two on top So like above and below like this Four plates Four plates Let s make it 16 But if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just But what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle then it would push away on both sides Two positive plates Two plates sounds twice as good as one but I m not sure that it is Four plates sounds even more appealing An infinite number of plates sounds fantastic I m hearing good ideas here I want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios So two positive plates Okay two positive plates and I m looking at the vicinity in the middle here is that right And do I want my two positive plates to be on the sides Negative plates Well negative plates okay Two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what Bend Okay we re getting a bending because if I draw it here But you still have to compare It d be like this kind of a picture It d still be bent Greater than the distance Okay so you ve got So based on that you ve got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape What about two infinitely long Two infinitely long plates Both negative What would the field look like Forge the potato shape What would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long evenly charged negative plates Wouldn t they go If I take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle what would it do What if I release it a little bit to the left side An infinitely long plate We derived this one before a single one Remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane It s constant It s a constant exactly right Brittany didn t even have to look at her notes on that one But you remember what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate Yeah gravity on the earth here you know big flat earth I don t care how far above the ground I am it s the same number it doesn t change at all That s exactly right So an infinite plate the field is some number another identical infinite plate it nullifies it So in the same charge okay Well that isn t going to work Infinitely far Infinitely far away from each other When Brittney says it s a constant even if you go to infinity I guess it d still be a constant either that or you go to zero It would be two sets one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they re infinitely far away where Two horizontal plates like this Yeah because I don t think that s going to work either Ben you re getting agitated back there And what are you saying We were just talking You re saying there s no way in the world they can be infinite Is that what you re saying Yeah You can t have an infinite plane anything because you re defining the shape So that s a good question When I ve got the shape here do we require that the thing that I m talking about fit inside of the shape No I m going to say no Okay so does that change your answer Okay I think we can and will look at situations where the surface And remember this is all leading up to that Gaussian surface idea we mentioned on Friday Where the Gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object Like an infinite plane we need to be able to study those even though I can t fit it inside of a box So we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there An infinitely long positive plate right in the middle Right in the middle Is that what you said about seven minutes ago Yeah I tried to ignore him because I didn t want you guys to get the answer too quick But I do want to acknowledge him Yeah tell me if this makes sense and why Somebody besides John and Ian It doesn t make sense that I ve got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it s a positive plate Would it have to be infinitely long Much longer If I don t Now I m not very good at drawing in 3D so is the potato lines are they diverging this way at all I can t tell They re uniform this way parallel lines this way so we know that it has to be infinite this way And not have divergence this way Well I didn t draw any lines coming out of the Do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging That s going to change the answer that you give If I draw another red line that s coming like this that s clearly diverging from this red line So I m going to assume that every line for this problem every line that I draw is parallel and then we ll get a new Perpendicular with the plate Yeah perpendicular to the board And then all positive coming out both sides Very good Alright I ve got one more drawing on there I want to hit and then we ll just say some fantastic summary words and then I ll give you guys a break The last one here instead of the three dimensional shape now all I ve got is a single sheet of paper And this sheet of paper I ve got I noticed I noticed parallel lines arrows coming straight out of that shape Write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict based on what you observed here what and where if you want to what the source of the field lines is What can we learn from the electric field lines They re all coming out parallel in one direction Yes parallel in one direction One direction They re parallel this way and they re parallel this way also So they re normal to the surface everywhere Are they coming from the other side All I see is lines penetrating this way so I could actually draw them like this and that s fine Do you know anything about the other side of the plate like is there anything there It s a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate Oh okay Yeah they re not diverging at all Yeah uniform orthogonal all that good stuff Into the paper So they re coming out of here They re going into here and coming out here Oh okay To the differences that s a closed shape This is a two dimensional surface If I had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference right Okay guys let s see what we ve got here I m going to ask Paul first Emily second and then we ll see if Michael can go for the trifecta Oh no No pressure You can be wrong it s alright Paul what is based on your observations what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here Where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object on this sheet I think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through Where they re just passing through Yeah So then where do you think it s coming from What does that tell you about the source of the electric field I m not sure You have more to say No Emily give it a try Since it s positive on this side Yup You can see that there might be a positive charge Okay so if I had a positive charge on this side I would get electric field lines going like this That s correct okay Or if you had a negative charge Ah okay so you re answering two things which is pretty overachieving but I like it that you re saying that instead of a positive back here it could be a negative over here Okay now there s something incomplete about what you re saying The positive here versus there could be a negative here that s a great insight that it could be one or the other but Michael s going to help us out because you re a little incomplete on what you re telling us They have to be infinite Infinite Infinitely strong charge Infinitely long whatever a plane A plane yeah A plane back here that s infinitely large distributive charge that s positive That s the only way to get a uniform field here Can it work with what Emily was saying about it could be a negative over here It could be an infinitely long thing here There s one more option Does anybody It could be intro That this piece of paper here is neutral And you could just put a new positive charge But be careful Any positive charge if I start off with the very first drawing and I look at what happens when I put a sheet here the field lines are like this They re diverging I m not having divergence here at all So it can t come from any old point source We are going to assume that this thing is neutral though Okay that itself is not It s just capturing the story of what s going on Hannah Could there be both a positive and negative along the plate Yeah you can have both You bet That seems like a little bit of overkill but as long as you re making your sheet infinite in size you might as well make two infinite s You have all your infinite That s right And two parallel plates two plates that are parallel to each other one positive one negative is a very common thing So common in fact that it s on my tie today Oh yeah there it is See that Hakim do you have a question Okay so it s the positive plane that s standing or negative plane Yeah the infinite plane The infinite plane I was about to say that That it would be infinite Yeah I think Michael was saying that it would probably be Not the charge distribution the sigma how much charge per unit area will be some number but it would just keep on going on Chris Yeah you know that would be a lot Reasonably speaking if something goes to infinity all of your homework is easy So there s no purpose for me doing that What is the answer Infinity or zero It s got to be one Infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge but it s distributed infinitely far away So that s okay Now remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field And here s the thing In the first three or four examples or five I guess for some people if I take a closed surface I can learn a lot Not everything necessarily but I can learn about what s inside of that Infinitively is the first one positive Yes Yes The next one that I drew was negative absolutely This most recent closed surface it had to be a positive plate shoved in there This last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with to gauge what s happening I don t know everything We ve got a lot of ambiguity And this is why with Gauss law we need to use this closed surface We need to look at it from all sides We need to be fully envelop in what s going on or else we might miss something We ll go back again The equation that I showed you last week we ll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field Go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes 
 On a regular basis Have you ever thought about what that causes I mean what causes wind to blow in the first place Whether it be a breeze Whether it be a hurricane Whether it be a tornado Would you take a few minutes in your notebook would you just draw a line write after what you wrote And I want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind Just do this on your own first What could cause wind to blow Take a few moments just on your own Just like always guys you don t have to be right here I just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing On a big scale on a small scale Anything that you ve got that we can build on anything that you put down Alright when you have this discussion in a few moments share your ideas with each other And then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down or what somebody else did Talk to each other See what everyone there is thinking What ideas do we have The air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks and it creates wind That s good I think wind develops because clouds carries that air I don t really know much Alright folks When we go let s use let s see who gets to share Person two We re going to go with person two And let me switch this over here real quick so I can write down some of your ideas Hold on Alright where d my pen go Okay here we go Person two And we re going to start over here Did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow No table seven Sorry I don t know but I said heat and cold air rising and falling Cause I know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising heat rising how you get in the air I m really not sure so I m just thinking Okay so something about hot air rising and cool air falling And like how they re Say that again And cold and hot air going over mountains Different land masses Okay very interesting Now she had the toughest job From now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory a different idea or you can agree or disagree with what Miah had to say But you cannot say I don t know Okay So you gotta kinda run with what s been said Keisha we re going to go back to you first What was your thought at your group Well we agree with Miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind Okay So I m just going to add on here temperature I was going to add pressure Temperature okay That may be something different Let s see what we can add to this So you re agreeing with Miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air Yeah Okay Table three you guys had a different kind of theory We agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure how the wind blows and stuff Okay so you guys talked mostly about pressure Yeah Could you pass that up to table two So far we have two theories One has been agreed to already We have temperature pressure Our group wasn t sure But I agree with Kavya in how the pressure You re thinking that it s something do with pressure And okay there s an agreement here with temperature as well Pass that up to table one Prescott what kind of ideas did you guys have Well we were talking and we kinda agree with A or hot air rising And pressure and air too but I was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind or carry the air faster Okay so let me add something about currents in here Cause that s another kind of interesting thing So are currents separate from these two Or the same Or added on to Or they another thing all together Just added on I guess Okay so we ve got temperature of the air we ve got pressure of the air and we ve got something to do with currents Could you pass that over to Conner Conner what is your thought We kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind Like low pressure and high pressure You know that s an interesting thing with the low pressure What would cause air to be different pressures I thought maybe the Earth s core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others Okay so let s see So you re agreeing with pressure and you re kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity Really interesting Oops hang on Something to do with gravity causing different pressures Pass that back to David David what did your conversation involve Well I thought the I really didn t know exactly what makes the wind blow but if I had to guess I d say it s air masses meeting Let s put that down Okay Hold on And you threw out something that says air masses meeting Alright so when you talk about air masses give us more of what you thought of what that is What do you mean an air mass And when they meet how would that produce wind Well I know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm I was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass then when they collide it might produce wind I don t know why that s just my guess No no that s fine So you re thinking when you re saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm But maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind Yeah So let me put that on So air masses meeting So since we re talking only about wind right now it s the same kind of air mass meeting Alright Would you pass that back to Ah Nathan we re going to have you go since Amber already went today Back over to Nathan Nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there Well we didn t really know but based on what everyone said I agree with Miah that it s the hot air rising and the cooler falling But I also think that David s ideas are kind of interesting I agree with A You re agreeing with A that it has something to do with the temperatures Miah what s your thought I also thought what David said cause I know how tornadoes are formed But then I thought air masses are way too big And I know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind And so I think it might have something to do with air meeting together I think that has to do with hot and cold air kind of mashing Okay so You said with hot air rising and cool air falling And then you said something about hot and cool air mashing So when you talk about them mashing are they like coming together and like swirling together What do you mean by mashing Mixing not mashing Mixing Yeah just kind of colliding together but not swirling Okay so when you re saying hot air rising cool air falling you re saying that those two things are mixing and it s by the mixing together that s what s causing the wind Yes Okay Guys take a second I want you to talk we ve got two more tables to go But I want you to take a few moments talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far And then any questions that come up based on it Talk to each other Alright guys about ten seconds Everybody time And three two and one Great ideas so far guys Let s go to the last Any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had Yes Well I think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass I mean if you re adding water with water it s just making more water Huh so you re saying instead of wind being created you would just have a bigger one And I also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it s two of the different air masses but maybe I think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix You re bringing a couple of interesting things You re saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet you re saying that those are kind of like magnets Like opposite sides attract Am I understanding what you re saying Sorry I mean both of the I m a little confused Also I would kind of agree with David now because if I m thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse Right So would that analogy be a wind refusing Or would coming together be more like the wind I think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass but there s the magnets are the same the air masses are That s really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that which is really cool to bring in Let me get the two other theories and we ll come back to that How big are air masses Well let me come back to that Let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in Richard what d you guys end up talking about Did it change as you saw these ideas Yeah so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity s movement Actually we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure You know I m going to because I think that s an interesting theory I m going to put it up here anyway You said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself So with gravity and movement of the Earth Okay and then once you started throughout this round you re thinking more it has to do with changing pressure Okay and you agree with what Connor was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure Yeah So are you feeling like are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together Or does something else cause a change in pressure Okay alright That s fine Where s the mic Can you pass it up Here I ll come get it Abigail last theory Go Well at first we weren t sure And we were talking about kind of atoms moving like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining But then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air moving and changing make wind from the combination So you re really mashing it all together So your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other That was the first part And then did that end up causing pressures did you say No like and then the different types of air kinda combined I guess So then molecules move away from each other When you say different types of air So like warm hot and pressure And those combine Should I add that to this I don t know Tom Yeah Tom I have a question How would two air masses meet if they didn t have wind to bring them Well now that s an interesting question Do air masses now that s a really interesting question Are air masses just these big masses of air And then wind blows them around Because then it wouldn t make the wind if it couldn t if it couldn t come together it couldn t make wind Oh now that s a really interesting thing So is the wind Oh wow Is wind a result of the air masses Or do air masses need wind to move Well that s a really good question Ben you had a hand up I just thought about it and I didn t really want to share the question I just was thinking in my head and I thought through the question Alright Does anybody have any other theories they d like to suggest Other than are there Let s go through them real quick So we had the theory that said it s hot air rising cool air falling and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind We had the theory that said it s the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity We had something with currents So it s somehow the currents in the air whatever those happen to be that s what s causing the air to move as wind There s air masses meeting If it s the same what Dave was saying If the same air mass meeting that s what causes the wind It s gravity in the movement of the Earth which Richard and this table suggested Although they moved away from it I think it s a valid theory to be suggested And then it s molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things So would you take a moment and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you d commit to as far as which one you think it is Talk to each other I don t really know like what Matthew brought up how they would move So Alright guys here we go Would you grab the voter that is registered to you And when you turn it on you should have an A through F option And would you choose one of those to be your theory please Is this graded No it s not No we re just theorizing right now So just go with the one that feels best to you What s the question It is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow Wait for a few more people to vote Oh Mark we gotta get to voting Patrick you in Yep you re in Okay Mark what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best Votes are on your voter and fire away And he s the last one to vote as soon as he goes we ll see what way we as a class think Oh you got it Okay here we go Let s see what you think Alright so B is our best theory so far So right now as a group let me save this So right now as a group we are thinking that it is pressure and Let me ask you this Let me get a quick hand vote for this just out of curiosity One of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity How many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then Okay most of the people voted that way look like they re going 
 What I m going to do is we are going to use these projects to help students at our school Mrs Ess s class is not the only class that has had problems with students accidentally plagiarizing And that was the original reason that you guys came here today because somebody in another class had plagiarized something accidentally in Mrs Ess s class Your projects today are going to be used in other classrooms So we re going to have a contest We re going to pick the 5 best Powerpoints and we re going to send them out to other classrooms to help students learn why they shouldn t plagiarize Now some of you are already experts at Powerpoint We re not learning how to do Powerpoint right now A lot of you already know how to summarize because you learned to summarize in Mrs Ess s class So you have that experience There was a disconnect where you didn t put the two together So what we re doing right now is we re saying okay I know how to summarize now I know how to avoid plagiarism So let s start working right now You have your rubric Look at your rubric If you have a question raise your hand and I ll come and explain it And we re going to start right this very second So go ahead and get into Powerpoint and do your powerpoint If you re going to be doing something different like making a newspaper a brochure or maybe a podcast then you re going to start working on that And I am just going to walk around you guys Our focus is plagiarism and the way we avoid plagiarism is through focusing on summarizing So you can refer back to your notes Remember you used your Cornell notes the other day when you were here and we went online and you took a summarization quiz and tutoring session I ll be right there in a second Yes I m sorry Okay David Yes yes absolutely I m sorry I ll be back to you in a moment Yes I think that would be a great idea We re focusing on plagiarism and we ve learned about how summarization is one of the ways to avoid it Right Okay I m sorry Sure Very good Oh great you re back up Okay tissues are behind the globe Can you go get one for me Okay have you been helped You have to know how to spell it Right over there on the board How s it going Cathy Pretty much Take off the S I like that though It was good You need some help Mr Phillip No thank you You re fine What you re doing is looking through here at all the requirements So when you use your creativity to put this together And I yes what does this word mean Okay So multimedia basically means that it could be either Powerpoint or a podcast So you need all of these to get the highest grade So if you come up with something additional you re going to get a higher grade This part you did here is basically your method of memorization which would be number 3 How is it going Pretty good Now remember if you re taking a definition of plagiarism from a website then you really need to say where you got that There s a way of doing that You re going to state where you got that and when it was yes That s okay You re going to use your own words It s interesting how different all of these look Yes you can You definitely can I also have some books available They re hiding You could Eric use this book too I ve got you marked right here Would anyone else like a dictionary You can get an online definition too Okay I ve got them marked You can find it easily that way Can we use our paper to take notes Yes of course you can If that would help you Cathy Have you gotten to Powerpoint yet No Do you know how to do that Oh good Okay David I m sorry I ve got it in this book too Is that your second slide or your first slide My first Okay Okay like I said before the purpose of doing this is to try to help other students in our school And a lot of you already know ways of avoiding plagiarism Maybe you were even aware that you were plagiarizing And we ve been focusing on summarizing Of course there s another way you can do it Paraphrasing is a little bit harder but we re focusing on summarizing And besides summarizing another thing that you can do with summarizing is still giving credit to where it came from Yes Hang on Okay What was this Animoto video telling us Can someone raise their hand and Yes Brandy Telling you not to plagiarize Telling you not to plagiarize Very good So if that s what you were thinking you are thinking about what we re going to talk about today which is plagiarism Now I m going to go on the internet right now and we re going to look at the definition of plagiarism Well actually we re going to look at the definition for plagiarize which is to steal and pass off as your own So you can think of internet plagiarism as equal to Cheating Cheating and that is considered Academic misconduct Academic misconduct and that s when you get in big trouble sometimes Now we re going to watch a TeacherTube video about plagiarism So you will be using your worksheet and we re going to hear a story about this kid named Billy and you ve got some bubbles here So right here in the central box is what you re going to write down you re going to write in this box and you can t write anything yet because nothing s happened so far but you re going to write about what Billy did And in the little circles right here you re going to write the causes why it probably happened and you re going to predict what happens to Billy So we re going to start right now so I want everybody to listen carefully Here we go Mrs Calstad Hey Mr Harris I have to show you this research report by Billy He did it on horses It sounds really good The pictures are good too Oh I love horses let me see it Wow Mr Harris this is really good I told you it was But you know what it kind of sounds familiar I ve seen a lot of students looking at this website called allhorses info and I think it s some of this exact same information I think we should check it out Let s pull it up Sure Here s the website Mr Harris and it says right here The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries What does Billy s report say The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries So it s the exact same sentence That s not good That s not good That s cheating And look at that picture too It s the exact same photo That is the exact same photo Did Billy give credit to his sources anywhere on that page No I don t see it anywhere No Well that s a pretty serious thing I ve heard of students in college being expelled for that Really Yes I think they call it plagiarism when you copy someone else s work and don t give them credit and that s a shame because all Billy had to do was write down where he got his facts and give some credit to that photo too How could he have written his report differently Well if you look at his first sentence when it says The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries he just could ve changed the words a little bit Maybe he could have explained what domesticated means I don t think that s a word that he would use a lot I see what you mean What could he have done with this picture though Well he could use this picture If he took the picture himself he wouldn t have to do anything but if he did take it from this website which it looks like he did he d just need to copy the web address down at the top and that would be it That way he could give the photographer credit for that person s work So what you re saying is it s okay to use facts from other sources just put them in your own words Correct And be sure to include in your report who wrote these facts Exactly and as far as the photos go you can use a photo as long as you include the web address that s on your screen and I think in library and psychology class you and I will work on that with students so everyone will know how they can properly give credit to their sources We definitely will That sounds good Now we just need to talk to Billy about this Sounds like a plan Where is that Billy Okay you have your work sheets Let s start filling them out right now Make sure your name s on your paper and we won t take too long we ve got some extra time as well So when you start writing if you have a question raise your hand You re going to do the predicted cause and the predicted effects Now while you re filling these out I m also going to ask a question I want to do a quick question What do you think happened to Billy Can somebody raise their hand and tell me What do you think might happen to Billy He got in trouble with the teacher He probably got in trouble with the teacher Anybody else Detention And possibly detention yes Suspension Say it one more time A suspension Very good Okay Now let s do a quick think pair share Okay what is the message of this video So talk to you neighbor Let s think in a pair Talk to your neighbor The person sitting right next to you Cassie you work with Brandy Brandy you work with Santiago Talk to your neighbor real quick Your question is what is the message of this video Okay we re going to stop right now Raise your hand if you can share if you can share out right now Yes He could use facts and research Very good So if he used facts and research information in his own words this wouldn t have happened Yes He has to give credit to the original site or the place he got it Very good Thank you Cassie that was great Okay So now we ve done our video and I just wanted to say that as a sixth grader I made a big mistake Before they had the internet I used an encyclopedia set and I copied stuff into my report and I thought Here s the information I didn t realize I was actually plagiarizing it because I didn t put it in my own words So now what we re going to do is we re going to move over to our renaissance responders So right now you re all logged in and I am going to go over to that right now and we have a survey So it s all re programmed and we re ready to go and what we re going to do is we re going to flip our paper to the back side and you ve got your questions right here We re doing an anonymous survey to find out how you feel about plagiarism So I don t want you to feel that it s going to be something that I m going to know your response to because it really is going to be anonymous and I want you to circle the answer that is the most popular response to the group So when you look up here you re going to see a graph and you re going to circle the answer that is the most popular and you re going to star the answer that is the second most popular Okay What is the level of plagiarism at our school You have three choices students do not plagiarize very often that s letter A B about half of the students plagiarize C almost everyone plagiarizes Go ahead and respond Now we re going to look at the graph and we re waiting for everybody to respond right now and I m looking and I can see some people have responded and some people have not responded On your paper you will be circling the most popular response and you re starring the second most popular response Can somebody tell me what the most popular response is right now A A Okay and that was students don t plagiarize very often That s good to know So go ahead and mark on your paper right now A has a circle around it for number one and our second most popular response actually is C and E so both of those will get starred I m so sorry did I say E I meant C I think that what happened is somebody made a response in a column that they shouldn t have made a response in that column So they answered the wrong question So you did it the proper way We re going to move on to our question number two 
 Look at your station one information And the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather And yesterday you guys constructed a graph to show that data Why is it useful to construct a graph in science class Sky Because it s a visual way to show you information It s a visual way to show you information I have a case up here as an example Based on that graph what does that pattern reveal about our question Gabrielle The cooler the temperature the more the I mean more increases in time The more what increases in time The more uh weather Okay anybody want to restate that Rebecca The colder it is the more time it takes to weather Very good The colder it is the more time it takes to weather If we re talking about dissolving a tablet is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering Logan Chemical weathering Chemical weathering So the colder it is the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur Would you agree Thumbs up or thumbs down Thumbs up I would agree Now I want to talk about so what Why does it matter to us Why does it matter in our daily lives Talk about it for one minute record your thoughts on your wipe board and be ready to share back We could consider where to build our stuff In what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot What about up north You ve got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts Okay it might dissolve faster in a warmer place Or what type of rock would I want to avoid Limestone why Okay very good very good Alright let s share some of our ideas with the class Info managers table three what did you find If you live in a cold environment there will be less chemical weathering than there is in a warm place Good point if you live in a cooler environment there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate Who s gonna be particularly concerned with this What for instance job field is gonna be concerned with this idea Forrest Construction That would be one area what else Statue building Yeah any kind of artist who s designing statues What type of rock would you want to avoid if you re living in a warm area And you know that chemical weathering could be a problem What rock would you avoid Patrick Limestone Limestone Do you guys have some proof for me Somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone Which station Alex Station three Flip to station three for me At station three who can explain to me what the lab was that you did Someone I haven t heard from Colin We put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk And the chalk didn t dissolve in the water but the acid made it fizz bubble and it was just dissolving And why did we use chalk What is chalk a type of What is chalk a type of Jeremy It s a type of limestone It s a type of limestone So your evidence showed that yes limestone weathers quickly with acid Why is acid a part of our environment How does it become part of our environment Andrea Acid rain Acid rain acid rain Now as we grow up it s important that you re environmental advocates That you fight for protecting our environment What types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain Give me two ideas on your wipe boards Two ideas Is that polluting our water our air Polluting the air and it s getting into our clouds Very nice very good So air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation You are making worst case scenarios You don t have to consider the unthinkable It can happen alright You don t have to consider the impossible So we can unplug outlets when we re not using them We can turn off the water when we brush our teeth What about things in your house Electricity Cut down on your electric bills Remember you burn fossil fuels to make electricity So right now as middle schoolers the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use Alright I want every table to share one idea Info manager from table one give me one idea One idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school instead of like everybody having their own individual cars Good point Or even better you can walk Instead of having that carpool line going on let s take busses Table two give me one idea Save power by changing your lightbulbs to CFLs Yeah use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs they use a lot less electricity good idea Table three give me one Conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth Now conserving water Think about what the question was How can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain We can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets Very good Unplug items from the outlets that s good Table four We could use hybrid cars Hybrid cars that s good They burn less fossil fuels good idea Table five Recycle Recycle How would that help acid rain Okay so it s cutting down on factory use that would be a good one Table six Cutting down on electricity Alright cutting down on electricity because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels Table seven is there any that haven t been said Carpool to work and school Carpool to work and school I love it You got something to add I was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them Yeah very good A lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling but it s good to reuse too That s a good idea as well So we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering We haven t yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering Which lab would answer that question How temperature affects mechanical weathering Station four Alright look at station four Take one minute you don t have to write this one down discuss it What does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life Take one minute And it like ice wedges and then it ll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks What were you supposed to be measuring In centimeters You measured in milimeters but you meant to measure in centimeters So how much was it in centimeters Well if you said it was at 79 which would be right there What centimeters is that at Around 15 Write down 15 Oh wait wait I had it going the wrong way and no one even noticed So if it was at 79 where would it be At 79 the tick mark right below the 80 About 16 About 16 and if it was at 76 where would it be at About 14 and a half Very good Alright let s pick someone at random who s the lucky person Andrew P What did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid When it was frozen it was taller When it was frozen it was taller What does that mean that it was taller Lucy Well the water was frozen to ice So it expands a little It expands I like the use of that word Water expands as it freezes Here in Louisville how is that a problem And it s been a particularly big problem this winter Ethan Because like the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings Soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads Right very good point Now that affects us here in Kentucky because we have those cold winters What types of areas would it not affect Forrest Florida Florida areas that don t have freezing that s a good point Now we ve talked about climate as far as temperature goes We ve talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering What is the other aspect of climate other than temperatures Other than temperature what is another aspect of climate Patrick How humid it is How humid it is Which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather Flip through Sky Seven Let s look at station seven Now during our labs the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready A material manager Can someone explain to me what s the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup What would that difference be Lucy Well the steel wool that was covered well the steel wool that wasn t covered with the cup it was all like stuck together and it wasn t rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out like it wasn t all stuck together and it was rusting Okay so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened had a lot of rust And the one that was moistened but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust Would you agree Okay what is the purpose of covering it Why do I cover that Otis Keeping the water from evaporating Yeah it s keeping that water in So is the covered cup a dry environment or a humid environment Humid environment A very humid environment I have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas and tells you what their humidity is like I m gonna flip off both lights to help you see it This is a tropical wet area tropical dry area semi arid which means dry arid then marine west coast Mediterranean and humid sub tropical These areas that are marked as humid sub tropical such as down in Florida those areas that are marked as humid what do they have to be cautious about If it s a humid area what do they have to be cautious about Don t see a lot of hands talk about it for one minute What do humid areas have to be cautious about Now think about this an area like Kentucky And our summers aren t just hot they re humid So we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering and we have to deal with Yeah so we re kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios Yes we definitely are Good point Alright I need someone I haven t heard from to share let s see who the random card is Lucy What do you think They have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff They have to be careful of rusting Good point Because the more humid the air is the more likely you are to have what Oxidation Now there was another lab where we used steel wool What was the purpose of the other steel wool lab What were you trying to answer what were you trying to determine Jamiel what do you think There was the key word the what kind of water Salt water You look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate You look to see if salt water did Silently look at your data and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Jeremy did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Yeah 
 This one is probably medium So this one is mine So this has to be a medium And this one has to be a large because My medium is half way up to here So it has to be a large So you make a prediction about how many small rocks it takes to make a big I think it s gonna be 12 small rocks That s a good idea Put our small rocks we have here so we make it draw two little blocks and if we have 12 Draw a rectangle and just put put your line through right here What do you think how many small rocks I think that there is going to be eight We have eight rocks So I think that there s going to be What about you I have 10 11 12 Boys and girls I had a good question If you ve got more rocks than you do boxes you know that we ve got how many boxes How many boxes Ten There s ten So at the top you can write since we ve been working with place value with tens and ones you can put ten We know that s how many boxes we have You could put plus six if you have which number 16 16 If you all had 11 what could you do You got ten so you would write plus one If you had 12 you would write you ve got 10 so what would you write above it Plus two So you can do it that way Good question Now what about you make a prediction of five then you ask us how many baby rocks we think that ten makes I think that there is going to be These can be large And there s one two three four four larges He s already told you how many mediums there are However you think Very good So you ve got yours sorted by size or you could see if there s another way you can sort your rocks We just did size first so we could do our work Very smart Very smart Tell me about looking at the graph how many small you had Diana How many small rocks were there Five Alright how many medium rocks did you have 11 And how many large Four Good good and you sorted them Oh you got some nice rocks Oooh Nice rock there it s pretty Neat Now this looks much better much better Medium there s one two three four five six seven eight nine Three four five six seven eight nine 10 Wait wait One two three four five Now we need five more to make 15 One two three four five six seven eight nine Four five six seven eight nine I counted 14 Put them together One two three four I d say like maybe it goes with the white Okay what about this one That goes with the white right What about this one Hmm I d say like what does it have the most of I d say probably white What about this one This one goes for tan This one is this one goes This one goes too This goes with the gray too This one goes to the I think it goes It goes with the white Now let s see I think it s a pretty rock Wait oh That one goes there I know it They all do Wait these go with the green No this one this one is gray It s still got sand in it This one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish I d say like maybe green too We ll have all yes Okay now this rock Okay Diana Cam and Gaelin What I want you to do is you ll probably how about you just take the rocks Because I can t remember What s going on We re sorting them a different way You re sorting them a different way And what way would that be How did you all decide to sort rocks I thought we d sort them by color and now we re gonna do it by cut Tell me that again because I don t I don t know that part Now since we did the color we re going to do is we re going to do by texture What s texture It s by how it feels Oh well can you teach me Find out the texture from these two rocks I see how it feels And since this one feels very smooth I ll put it by itself Well can I feel it Pretty smooth Pretty smooth Have you felt it Feel it How you think it feels Smooth It does feel pretty smooth And it looks like a piece of meat It looks like a piece a meat Yes Better not eat a rock should I Okay where does this one need to go It needs to go Over here We haven t finished quite yet so Okay And this one is like I ll say pretty rough Pretty rough can I feel this one Oh gosh Whoo Yeah It does feel a little rough It does feel like it s got some sand on it You know a word that I can think of that makes me think of that Rough Rough or gritty You know sand is gritty feeling Well that s kind of gritty It does feel a little rough It can stand up It stands up I m gonna do it put it by itself Okay And we re going to keep on doing it Until all of them are sorted Okay this is a pretty cool rock how does it feel I ll say pretty bumpy kind of rock Pretty bumpy pretty rough Oh this one s very rough So rough I can hardly stand myself Look at the shell on it It does have a shell in it On the other side look On the other side turn it like right here it has another shell It does so what kind of rock would this be A two fossil rock A fossil rock And what kind are they what s it called If it has a fossil imprint in it Fossil If it settled and got a fossil Sedimentary It would be a sedimentary rock Very cool I m so proud of you That was definitely very rough Have you felt it This is What do you think On the back is kind of squishy It is rough Okay you all keep working you re doing a good job I m proud of you Okay Now you can put it with the rough the super rough I think this one is I can tell I say medium a little rough a little smooth This one goes in the middle This one is smooth This is super rough Let me feel Smooth I m gonna put it in the middle because I think Very good Arianna I like the way you One more medium rock than large Because we have eight medium and seven large Because you can see A smooth side and a rough side Because if you add two more together it make 12 Medium is seven and large is eight And I have an idea when you do your rock what about you trace it 
 Great job thank you for playing along It s so much nicer to play with live accompaniment than it is recorded Your assignment two weeks be able to play an improvised solo in this key in F concert utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales We ll leave in just a moment just relax Utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales I ll ask you to play live on this Bosaladera I also want you to outside of class find a Latin piece of music it doesn t have to be bossa nova that you can play along with identifying the Dorian and the Mixolydian scale that fits that key Pick a song that you can identify the key and that you feel comfortable playing in that key to bring back and play for us I want a recording here so you re going have to find a mp3 CD DVD something along that you can get to class So you can share this information with each other Questions Time frame is two weeks If you went through this quickly tell your buddy how long you got and what you have to do go That s a great question thank you Yes yes do it in vibes it will be wonderful You can do this it s in F scale it s in F scale is what it is And I saw your results and they were outstanding Very good let s all grab an encore thank you and I will see you tomorrow Keep the rhythm sync Soft As we do our solos here if you would take your pencils and when you hear the soloists play on these notes on the side of this changing I want you to put a mark beside that change where you are Put a count on it Each rotation will be different Sometimes they may play from the middle scale to the middle or the whole thing Wherever you think that happens I will be documenting it over here too All right Today s volunteers are beginning with the vibe player and then we ll just go through the trumpets the trombones and saxes and those others who are assigned to play today Here we go everybody got pencils ready And one one two three four Here we go Rockville On my mark One two ready One two and one two ready play 
 It s probably three Because five to the third is 125 Alright so let s test that out Can I use my calculator You can have your guy test it out here Oh The other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this This is something that is unusual because it s got that subscript Read that first line up at the top where it says pronouncing logarithmic equations Log base b of x equals y Yeah so can you transfer that pronunciation to for example the one in example six How would you say that out loud Log base two of eight equals It s three Equals three So that s how we say these things out loud Log base two of eight The little number this subscript is the base Keep going you guys are doing fantastic Speak up The log of 10 000 is four Forgot I don t have a pencil You re off No pencil In number nine is it one For number nine Yeah When the log when the base is equal to X When B is equal to X it will be one So would 10 be negative one Uh 10 yeah negative one Oh I think I get it now And then 11 would be Negative three Negative three yeah It s like the power stable thing you know Yeah It s like four to the y would be equal to this Yeah So 12 and 13 would be zero Let s see Yeah Yep Okay Pretty easy Yeah and What s 14 14 is one half So again what you re saying is If it s a fraction or if like like for 14 Yeah It d be a fraction So 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half Yeah So that what about that one made you think it s going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers The other ones were integers because in the log the little exponent there Mmhm is less than the actual number Okay let s work on the pronunciation because this is something that s brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud Let s go back up to the top where it says read this out loud So Matt I ll have you Are you the what is your role here We re professors here Oh so that s a good role for you So why don t you speak that out loud Log base root of x equals y Yeah now I want you to say the first example out loud Log base of log base five of 25 equals 2 Yeah so it s hard to pronounce it Yeah But the little number that s down is what Uh base Yeah so it s the base So when we say it we re gonna say base little number whatever it is Alright so now say what you were saying before either of you guys You told me why it comes out a fraction How will you recognize it comes out a negative number When the y or when the x is a fraction and the log base is a whole number Okay yeah so like which examples do that Ten and eleven Alright that s good How will you recognize if it comes out as zero See any patterns for the ones that log If the x is a 1 Alright yeah Why does that make sense Have you figured it out Like any number to the power of 1 is itself or no it s zero Or I mean not any number to the power of zero is one Exactly Alright you re very you re getting right to the idea of what a log is How will you recognize the ones that will come out one without calculating X equals the base Okay well said Why does that make sense in terms of exponents Cause if you divide itself it ll equal one Can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one Because that s the next thing we re going to try to do Seven to the fifth power Seven to the one equals seven Good having done all of this can you say what a log is in one word A single word It s like the power of Mmhm it s the exponent Yeah Good a log is an exponent Now what I d like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is yeah Woah oh oh oh oh It would be Don t stop So it s gotta be two Take the so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number So right to the there Yeah so 32 Something with Something to the fourth Yeah Maybe five five to the fourth Five to the Execuse you So 59 is One 52 equals one So it d be 59 Yeah 18 would be Just three Is it a thousand Yeah a thousand You put ten thousand I have a question Yeah For this one what s the for this one what s the log No well yeah I don t know The log of what I think I understand your question but you first have to figure out the way to read these things Read that part that first because the pronunciation is challenging at first Log base b of x equals y Alright so now read example Well we know example four is three So the log is three So read example four out loud So log three of 27 equals three Good except I want you to say the word base in there Okay log base three of 27 equals three Perfect so I think your question was about examples seven and eight So what s the base Wouldn t the base be one it s just not there It s not there Here s the question the answers the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight Go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation What s equivalent to that Oh if it s not there the base is ten Alright so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven Ten squared equals 100 Ten squared equals 100 Does it still work for that Is that void Mmhm Because it would be ten to the fourth equals But I thought he just said the base was one Well he said the base was one He thought it might be Oh it s not It turns out it s ten Okay So the base if not written is ten I want you to check this two ways Who s our calculator person here Alright so Brandon I want you just to type in the log but just use this button It s next to the seven Just type in log of 100 So if he doesn t use any base it comes out as two Now try it with the log base on the new operating system log base ten of 100 Log base ten of 100 Mmhm See if that still works Two It turns out it s sort of optional If there s no base what is the base Nothing No it s a certain thing So if there s no base written like all of the other ones had a base written Okay If there s no base written it s saying what s the number to raise a certain base to to get 100 And this one came out two So what s the number that you can use as a base squared to get 100 Ten Yeah so if there s no base the base applied is ten And it turns out you can write it or not So what I d like you guys to do is as you re working through these also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you re taught So just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again Yeah sure And the one s at the bottom you can t just type into the calculator So you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there Then for like any number in there That s a really good insight How come that s the case Because anything to the zero power is one You got it Yeah Except for one number There s one number you can t put there Zero Yeah good job You got it good job Thank you 20 would be 81 I wasn t even close So ten alright so ten to the third would be 1000 For 18 wouldn t it be a thousand supposed to be base is implied to be ten Ten to the third would be 1000 I m not sure For 18 I don t know Alright Alright say it again except this time include the word base Log base of log base of eight Wait log base of eight equals zero Close Log base eight Log base eight of one equals zero That s it exactly yeah Okay So we say base where s the base always on a log equation Under the exponent Yeah its a subscript it s down A subscript So I d like you to pronounce number 12 Log three of one equals zero Close I want you to get the word base in there Log base three of one equals zero Yeah and that way if you re always saying what the base is when you create an equivalent exponential function it s going to be a lot easier So next to each one of these let s do a few together Let s do the top row going one six 11 I want you to write an exponential equation using 5 25 and 2 So it would just be five squared equals 25 Exactly What s the base in that equation It s five Yeah So you did two cubed equals eight Yeah Yeah so now you recognize you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent Yeah that s good Each of these numbers is an exponent What d you notice about the ones that came up zero Would you be able to recognize those and predict Any number works for it Really What do you mean any number works for it For this one Oh I see for that last one You could put any number here other than zero Yes I thought it was one but they had got it One works but so does two So does two three four and five I m wondering about the ones like 12 and 13 How would you predict or recognize in the future that the log is going to be zero If it has a one for the X For the X yeah Mmhm yep I think there s a fancy mathy word called a characteristic for that But we don t use that word very often But yeah you could say the x cause that s how it showed up in our first equation Sure How will you recognize that it s going to come out a negative number If it has a fraction in it Mmhm As the X Okay well said yeah Why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents On the green chart whatever is on the left side and whatever s left Yeah Our powers table You re talking about all of our fractions here Yeah How about the ones that came out with one as the log The log was one They have the same base and the same x value And what about this one This is a fraction so Yeah how come it had a negative log Well I know it s because it s a fraction Can you write an equivalent exponential equation Two to the no two to the negative one Mmhm equals it doesn t equal this right Actually it does Two to the negative one equals half Okay Yep Okay so that s correct 
 Our is like Crown Crown Royal and like it shows like a helmet and like an ad for it and it says He who wears the crown I think that s like if you wear the helmet you will seem cool Mm hmm and the helmet is for what do you think Motorcycles or cars kind of racing kind of stuff And Crown Royal tobacco or alcohol Alcohol and racing a car Thoughts Drinking and driving Huh Well that s bad But they appeal to your your uh love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff but those two don t really mix do they Next group Ours is tobacco and it has a picture of a firefighter and it says A bit braver so it s trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver and trying tobacco So the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver What do you think Could it really work If I chew tobacco Am I gonna be able to fight a fire No But firefighting appeals to a lot of young children right That bravery that toughness that rugged fireman thing It s like if I do chewing tobacco I m a rugged fireman type Um what are my teeth gonna look like though Yellow Not gonna look like the rugged fireman type am I Fireman sounds like he smiles is that what you said All right um ladies Um ours was alcohol and um they got our attention by like the grandma and the daughter playing patty cake and telling stories about her So grandma and daughter and granddaughter playing patty cake lovely little sunny porch sponsored by Budweiser Oh my Oh that s so popular So drink You re appealing to the family nature And the message is drink our drink Yeah it says that like all stories weren t about family they also had some other stuff Family and Budweiser Yeah No Yeah you re getting it now All right Ladies Um ours is um There s isn t really an ad There s is a display at a grocery store Yeah like there is um a whole bunch of like alcohol in the background and up closer there s tobacco and then there s a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids Right next to the The tobacco Tobacco okay Candy bars Like right there and then um also you have pretty much the candy Alcohol behind the booth tobacco right up front and candy bars right at hand level Kids would probably think that tobacco s candy They might Or as good as candy Does tobacco come in flavors like candy does Yeah No Yes it does Oh Mint berry apple Ew really Really Hey I think I missed a group Did I miss a group This one up front Nope Did I get you guys already Did you guys share Oh you did share just with me Share with the rest of the group It s Ours is alcohol and like if you re a rockstar you ll drink like if you drink this then you will become a rockstar What hook did they use The girls in bikinis So how many guys are in that picture One One guy and he s the one who s drinking the alcohol and Fifteen girls Fifteen girls in bikinis So if the message is if you drink this You ll get hot girls You ll get hot girls yeah All right you ve had a chance to let Oh sorry Eyes Ears Mouth Thanks You ve had a chance to look at these ads Um you ve got a chance to see how they re trying to hook you in You re knowing that the messages that they re sending are slightly warped It s their trick to pull you in but it s your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills Weigh it out Consider but then choose something else that s healthier So we ve looked at negative influences It s time to talk about positive influences in your life things that can help you say no to all of that no matter how appealing it is no matter how many girls in bikinis show up Leave your cards right where they are in the center It s time to take a look at the charts that are around the room There are five of them These are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs alcohol tobacco like a social activity um something you can do with someone else Ideas Have a sleepover Sleepover good All right so in just a few minutes we re gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings We re gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this Can anyone name one physical activity something you can do that would be instead of using drugs a positive thing Football Yeah Did you want to share too Go ahead Um riding your bike around the block Good You re on the right track guys Keep those ideas in your head When you get to the chart you ll have to write it down What s something you can do with your brain a mental activity that would be positive Chess Chess I like chess Math Not for everybody I understand Um this chart over here says Emotional What s something you can do um that can make your emotions feel better your passions or whatever How can you support yourself emotionally so you can say no to this Trying to think happy Yep Positive thoughts Watching emotional movies Definitely gets your mind off those I know you got great ideas and I m gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes so save them in your head Okay The last one is spiritual Spiritual Somehow you can nurture your spirit so you have the ability to say no to negative influences Go to church Church All right Save it You ll get a chance Time to look at your pencils again Leave your papers right where they are okay Face up This time we re gonna go by color and you might notice that there are markers at each station for the right color So when you get to the station if you are patience I promise I ll explain it No worries When you get to your station we re gonna start with your bag of colors You will take your bag of colors and your marker and you will only use your color marker So if you are a green guy you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first You ll write down however many ideas you want You ll talk it out with your group You might notice Mitchell that I also put group work uh reminders up here about how to work with others in your group One everybody has the right to speak so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to and to write it down the topic Don t interrupt Give everybody a chance to share their side Two everybody has the right to be respected We re not looking for put downs We re looking for ones that can encourage us positive things so when you re getting ready to write positive things speak positively to each other as well And three everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict So if you re having a difficulty in your group talk it out Work together to solve that problem If it s not working and you can t solve the problem who can you turn to for help You Me And others in your group So if you re a green person you re gonna get one green marker and there are multiple in here in case your marker doesn t work Get a different one Write down whatever ideas you want When you hear me say Switch or Rotate you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock Take your marker with you So there ll be multiple colors on here You ll get a chance to write on every one Yes How does this work Are you supposed to write it down like a list You can write all over that paper Yeah Anywhere as long as we re on the front Everywhere all over that paper so you can all be on there at the same time as you want you can take turns you can arrange however you and your group want to You each can have a marker though There s plenty of them for everyone Yellow s are over here at Emotional um I believe blue s are Social purple s are Physical and oranges are Mental Questions before we begin Think about something to do besides You ll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute so listen for me to say Switch Keep writing until I say it Go Here How about we take this and put it on the floor Does that work better I know it s going everywhere isn t it Here you go You guys want to take that one down too put it on the floor so it s a little easier to write on Yeah Good I know isn t it cool Yeah So I see you got chess on there Anyone think of some other ones Other mental ways to use your brain things you can think about it Think of school kind of activities things related to learning using the brain Spelling You can practice your spelling You can do your math I think you guys are in right place You have a lot of good ideas Tell me your favorite one so far Give him a spot Good How do you spell baseball Oh online The Playstation yeah that is definitely a social event I ve got XBox Live So social means involving what Talking to other people human beings a relationship with them All right Ready in 10 nine finish what you re writing eight seven six taking your marker with you in five Oh our marker Four Yep Your writing in your color Three two one rotate Spiritual All things that are spiritual What does that really mean Your spirit Your spirit yeah It could be feelings I think we did emotions though right Yeah So this one would be more nurturing your soul yourself We ve got meditation We ve got mediation right Yoga Oh yeah Why don t you write that one down How do you spell yoga Yes perfect The Bible poems How much do you connect with your spirit or your soul Any other resources or people Pastor from a church Friends you know from the church or wherever you attend services Who else besides a pastor can lead um a group You can pray Pray good You guys are on the right track Emotional support Where can we find emotional support Family friends good Who are some other resources for emotional support Culture How can we nurture your own good feelings What do you do to feel better Cuddle your pets Cuddle your pets You know that one s my favorite too It s okay you don t have to spell things All right capping markers Ready to move 10 nine eight seven six ready gentlemen in five taking your marker in four three two one Rotate 
 So good morning everyone Good morning Good morning today today what we have is we re going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced One was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that s required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent Okay And so we had a field trip to Wastewater Treatment Plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they re doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city So today I m going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates The overarching question is up on the board if you d like to see it It says how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws The environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city So I ll discuss the format of our debate First and that s again up on the board I will be finishing up my introduction here and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves who they represent and what their major goals are for today s debate Okay Then we ll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story so that our City Council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said So city council members please be writing your notes When we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate It s going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing Okay At the end each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today s debate Good And then as I said at the end we will have a vote City Council will vote on whether we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city Are there any questions before we begin Okay excellent And so I believe the this side had choice and so that means that Corbin and his group for representing industry will be allowed to have that closing the last closing statement today And so we ll start with Tyler and then we ll try to go back as fairly as possible back and forth So Tyler if you d like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you re here today Our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate We believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted The hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled While it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option Excellent So Corbin we re ready to hear your side and who you represent Our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate We hope to persuade the EPA and City Council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness And that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that Outstanding And so and then we will begin I guess then with Tyler who can go ahead now and you can ask your first question And we ll be looking for City Council members If you have any questions that need to be clarified statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it please raise your hand and we ll make sure that you get in immediately Okay This is so funny Okay we figure that since you say that our waters don t really need to be it already meets the standards of cleanliness but already in Colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered as the more chemicals because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry have already become endangered and extinct and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water s clean enough Okay let me ask you this Do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish We have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the EPA the standards that they re trying to enforce now Like we saw on the video this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae algae blooms start to produce So it s mostly the nitrogen phosphate that s preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe technically Okay I d like to follow this up with an article from I believe this is from the Gazette which is our Colorado Springs newspaper Since we re focusing this debate on Colorado most likely our city we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms says the writer of this article So therefore when you talk about algae blooms we don t have a problem with this So why should we be focusing on it Because the water runs off the lakes That does cause a problem with us Okay But even if we did have I mean a few Like I said again our city does not have problems with these So we can t therefore we can t focus our debate on these things because it doesn t apply to us Well that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don t have problems with algae blooms But I ve been in the mountains around our area and I ve seen many lakes ponds just completely covered with algae and scum And that so many of our local creeks Monument Valley Park and stuff are just littered with gross algae and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot And the same thing happened in the 1960s with Lake Erie and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay like we saw in the video And the same thing was happening where they said we don t need to fix it everything s fine and then just as nothing nobody did anything The lake soon was dead and it was like there s no fish in there And the water s just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes so doing nothing isn t really Okay so I m gonna interject What I m hearing is that there s a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue so I d like to hear from somebody in the City Council area who will be making a vote today How about your thoughts about the current water quality What you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently right now what level of danger are we at Have you heard a lot about this Do you feel like we are in need of serious change So we can direct the rest of the debate Okay Anybody who would like to contribute Okay Stephan Well all I know is that where we re located we re at the we re pretty much the first people that use our water and then it goes downstream for other people to use it so so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution the pollutants that we put into the water it s not it wouldn t be really affecting our city but the cities that are down the stream from us Okay but this article says that our excuse me I think I read this wrong our state does not have a problem with algae blooms Regardless of the algae problem it says without the oxygen the fish bugs and other organisms that live in the water will die and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life But that s a worst case scenario that we don t have right now and we haven t had and it s not an issue in Colorado Granted it might be an issue in like Chesapeake Bay or Lake Erie But we don t have it here it says so And multiple scientists have backed that article as well Now Corbin do you have any measurements or do you have some values that you can back that up with Not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous I tried to find some but I found So does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we Do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this Okay I would like to comment on I m sorry behind you I just called on her Oh excuse me So even if it s probable wouldn t you want to prevent it from like happening here with the algae Well if it s not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening Yeah if it happened but it hasn t happened yet Yeah but what she s saying is it might happen Yeah I mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might I mean I could say that you know an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow It might happen We don t know if it s going to happen But fish and other organisms are dying It is happening It s not necessarily just the algae but it s the future problem We ve already seen issues with the Yeah let s see what Nina has to say as far as City Council Well I just have a question wouldn t it be better to be safe than sorry _ You re right it would be better to be safe than sorry but like I said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the EPA required standards So therefore it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the EPA But we re saying that the EPA standards need to be improved Yes yes we realize that Because they re not they re too low and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams And those chemicals are getting through How would you go about doing this How would you go about stopping the pollution Because something that s important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it s something that s misconcepted is for example cars People think cars pollute the air and it exactly does pollute the air But when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it s also a pollutant Therefore industry s not the only people who are polluting the lakes It s actually U S citizens doing the same work too Okay I like that And so can you be more specific Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains Yes That may cause issues Yes Okay I ve got a whole bunch of them Alright Corbin why don t you share then what it is You want me to read all of them or just So we re not focusing just on one group There may be other groups as well but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate Go ahead Corbin Well the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he s found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants Some of those examples were railroad ties dentures and he found a live person inside of them one time So it s not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there It s you can t stop humans from putting out waste and a lot of the stuff that they re putting in there that they re actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion which some of the machines there do do are poisonous things like fluoride Which actually the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually Mason which is right up there and lead and mercury And it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion Well first of all I would like to answer Mr Dunmar s question or Mr Waz question I m sorry We do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water and it s 10 parts per million So that s just to answer that question and then to move on to yours Yes of course as you said in your own words you can t stop people from the pollution that they do cause However it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment And when we don t have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people but for also the wildlife for the economy for you know natural systems that occur within Colorado It s all you re putting it all on the line Okay let s talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water Okay Well let s talk about the costs that everybody s the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying Before you talk about cost would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying Okay I would like to comment on that That s an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution I do have a statement from the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki moon says More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war You just said from the United Nations Yeah this isn t yes we re talking about a local issue now but that is a statement that proves that Okay I would like to comment on this once more when you said United Nations that s Okay I m sorry We re going to have to go to hand raising I believe because we re getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish So Theo finish up and then Corbin will follow behind you No I made my point Okay Well like you said you do realize that s a local issue but the U N is United Nations of the world So that s not a local issue You re bringing up a fact that s from countries like Africa that don t have clean water at all nonetheless water So of course they re going to die from water poisoning but here in the United States we have the cleanest water in the world no matter where it is And Colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water if you will out of all the states Yeah because of the regulations we have in place and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water we need to restrict our regulations What are the new chemicals Yeah they ve been there for awhile We re having new problems though Can you explain it Everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous It hasn t been an issue before Why is it an issue now It has been an issue It absolutely has It has happened all over the United States Okay when we talk about nitrogen we re talking about if we restrict that we re talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here As we all know that we are we do grow many crops in our state And nitrogen mostly where it comes from is fertilizers used in that industry So to say that we re going to restrict nitrogen would be we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food Such as what What industries For fertilizers Fertilizers You can t use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have And not even lawn crops Crops lawns anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains which go into creeks which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was So shouldn t the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities We re already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into Okay so Will I hear you re saying that we re doing a lot What was learned on the field trip Specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city What role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant And how does that affect your group s goals for today s debate What are the scientists doing specifically and how does it support your side Like they said on the fieldtrip they use bacteria E coli to break down the wastewater that s in the water It s not like they re adding pollutions to it Their job is to take it out which they are trying to do By doing that they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it but they remove a lot of those afterwards It s not like to clean it 100 it s going to cost 25 billion dollars and that s just for the state of Colorado Okay let s see a City Council members I m trying to get to them quickly I m sorry Amanda behind you Stephan Where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars This is from the Gazettte The Gazette article It s from the article Science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water which is you guys s goal to restrict it it s going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all If you just want to do parts of it it s still going to be 2 46 billion dollars Which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water Wouldn t that be better tough than having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy Well I actually on the fieldtrip I asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into Fountain Creek and what we re doing for the environment and they said the water they put back into Fountain Creek is the water they get out of it It s cleaner than that Yeah So in my opinion that statement is totally absurd We re putting cleaner water for nature and nature seems to enjoy it more as I asked the chemist as well And farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops and it helps their crops grow more than Fountain Creek s streams already Excellent point Corbin Why don t we try Alexis and see what she has to say I have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy You can say a lot about the economy What do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy Well you say that 
 Megan what quadrant am I going to be centered in Quadrant four Good okay so I m gonna go to the right six and down five I know my radius is three root seven Now this may be a little difficult for you because three root seven is kind of a hard number to wrap your mind around Any thoughts on how we can tell which quadrants this goes into I want to know if it goes into quadrant one first Twink what could we do Do you un simplify it so when it gets through the center it d be like square root of 63 and then you like have so it s in between eight nine or I know it s in between seven and eight Okay did you guys follow her on that Yeah Yeah okay so Twink knows that this decimal is going to be between seven and eight because she knows it s the square root of 63 And the square root of 64 is eight So it s just below eight All right So you may be able to picture a decimal in your mind close to eight but not quite so we re armed with that knowledge true or false this circle goes into quadrant one Melissa Agree No Ben Yes it does go into quadrant one Do you have anything to back that up Yeah because it only the center point is down six and if we go up one more than that at least James It s down five and since it s more than seven it s gotta be at least past the two There were a lot of pronouns there What James was saying is we re five units below the x axis the radius is seven point something units long so we re going to top out right around there There s the top of our circle okay Let s speed up this process a little bit here The is it going to go into quadrant three Yes Why Abby Simpson Because it s over six and yeah you count seven the other way Okay Or a little over seven So we re going to be there Oh and now for the great dilemma will this circle go into quadrant two Robert what am I going to have to resort to The distance formula I can t hear you The distance formula Okay give me some more pairs to plug into this formula William Zero sorry zero minus six squared and then zero plus five squared All right Now what is the square root of 61 in simplified radical form Rue Is it just square root of 61 Good maybe that was a trick question Maybe not it s not going to break down any further because 61 is what type of number again Prime Prime okay so we ve got square root of 61 Robert you told me to use distance formula I used distance formula I followed your orders to the T I still don t know if this goes into quadrant two or not It does not The circle doesn t make it to quadrant two No So you re saying it does this Yes Prove it Well if you actually put I don t know Call on someone else please Maddie Since you know that your radius is the square root of 63 and that s a larger number than the square root of 61 it therefore passes the origin and it goes into the opposite quadrant or quadrant two in this case So you re saying it goes like that Correct Is that good enough for your piece of mind The radius is longer than it needs to be to reach And therefore yeah you re right Moral of the story The circle goes through all four quadrants So far we ve kind of been in been there done that land and so now I m going to take you into some new stuff right now The x and y intercepts First the x intercepts of this graph How am I going to find where this circle collides with the x axis Let me ask an intermediate question what do you know about every x intercept in the universe They all have something in common Abby All of their lines like the y equals zero What I m sorry Okay all like the y s equal zero like the y Which variable Y Equals Zero One more time Y equals zero Okay does that makes sense to you guys Yeah Because if you do go up or down to plot your ordered pair I ve got bad news for you you re not on the x axis any more Thus it s not an x intercept All right just one more time Abby I forgot what you had said earlier Y equals zero Okay so how am I going to find my x intercepts here Twink I have a question does it like the circle cross over x like the x axis twice Well we ll find out if it does I mean sometimes doesn t it Yeah So what do you do if it does So this is the first time in your math careers where you might have two x intercepts Colliding once and coming back down and colliding again with the x axis that s good instincts And I ll just warn you right now yeah we re going to have two x intercepts here Maddie how are we going to find these two We use the formula of a circle and we plug in for y zero Okay so let s get the equation up here because I forgot to write it earlier Josh Ah I don t remember Ella May X squared X squared plus or minus six Or no x minus six Okay Squared plus y Plus five Squared equals 63 Okay Maddie now we have our equation and you said to do what to it Since you know you have when you re looking for an x intercept you re always going to have zero for your y Oh Abby told us that Yeah you have your y in that formula equal zero Literally literally Well we ve got to see what x is Ben Well I know but that s it Does it make sense to you Yeah It isn t that hard of a concept and that s why I had Abby repeat it eight times If you get that y literally has to be zero you understand why you literally make y zero and then solve for x We re finding here s one of the ordered pairs right here that we re searching for and I ll be darned if the y is gonna be zero The question is what s the x All right so I ve got x minus six squared Plus I m just going to write five squared equals 63 So according to my calculations we have that right there Mason You forgot that middle term It should be minus 12 x Yeah or something like that You forgot the middle term You forgot like the something x Yeah it d be x squared minus 12 x and then plus 36 Oh so I need to square both those terms Yes no wait what d you say I just wanted to square the x and square the negative six No you didn t you wanted to square the whole thing Okay which means we utilize what process in math What s that called again Twink Foil Foil we had forgotten our oi Ben Where did we get 12 x from Vanessa We squared x minus six so we used factoring We did x minus Now do you see where we get it from Ben Okay thank you Ben What to do with the 63 what to do what to do Mason Do you just combine like subtract 63 from both sides combine all the like terms of the whole numbers and then you have a quadratic equation Okay Well now I have a quadratic trinomial and it s arranged in what What do we call that Kate Ellie Descending order Mm hm Nice so let s try and factor that Michelle you re shaking your head like no way It doesn t work Well all right then I guess we re stuck That s so stupid Don t we have to do the quadratic formula Yes if only I could remember that though It s been such a long time Sing the song You tell me the song I ll actually write the line pertinent to this problem what s the first line Keep going Plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4 a c all over 2a Okay I m going to do some of the math for you and then I m going to have you do some of the math for me because I m more interested in seeing that you can do this So I get 12 plus or minus the square root of 152 over two Now normally normally I would have you guys simplify that and give me exact answers But it s hard on a graph for you guys to see where something like 12 plus root 152 is I mean that s kind of an abstract So we re actually I m going to let you do decimals here So here s what I want to do Kevin s row through Sarah s row I want you guys to find the plus branch so you do plus You two rows find the minus As soon as you get an answer real quietly and quickly check with a neighbor and make sure we have confirmation Let s go to the nearest hundredth Okay if you ve got an answer that corresponds to what your neighbor got regroup Regroup Ellie If you ve got the same answer as your neighbor raise your hand right now over here So Melissa what was the value of x you got 12 2 12 2 what is it to the nearest hundredth Oh 12 16 12 16 All right that sounds about right And then over here my branch with the negative sine in there Ellie Negative 0 16 Okay now let s not lose sight of big picture here Context what the heck s going on Why have we been trying to chase down x and why are we getting two different answers And which one is right and which one s extraneous Help me make sense of all this now that the procedure is done Michelle Neither of them are extraneous because the circle hits the x axis at two points So what are my two x intercepts 12 16 and negative 16 In ordered pair form 12 16 zero and negative 16 zero There s that one right there makes sense And then the 12 16 zero hopefully you have room on your paper I don t have room on the board for that Should be somewhere over here It s a good pit stop moment right here Pull off to the side of the road Stop for a second are you sure this makes sense to you 
 A lot of people thought the mass of the water in the bag would be less than the mass of the ice cubes in the bag How many people One two just three of you Okay Cameron do you want to start us off with your reason why Because the cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer then that water bottle will like explode because it has so much ice in it Okay So because the water when it freezes expands then therefore you re saying it has more mass Yeah When it s frozen Yes But when it melts it doesn t take up so much space so it has less mass Yes Okay Michael Do you or are you on the same idea as far as more as far as thinking there s less Was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it s going to be less Mine was the same Same idea Yeah Okay Hannah you got a thought or something Well isn t it like the same Isn t it like the same thing because it s the same thing It s just expanding but it s going to have the same mass When you re saying it s the same thing what do you mean by the same thing Like if you have water in a water bottle like it does expand or whatever but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass Okay so Hannah s saying it doesn t matter that it expands It s still the same amount of stuff and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass Is that correct Kay Houston idea on that Well about the water bottle thing it would be opposite to this cause when you start with water it takes up the entire bottle But the bag the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag So it wouldn t So are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt are you saying the mass is going to go up It s going to increase Yeah Okay Colby I d say that when a solid turns into a liquid its form changes but not its mass Okay so kind of the same idea as Hannah Only you re talking about the actual forms then It can change form without changing mass Hannah says it s okay to expand because it s still the same amount of stuff Okay Michael s got another thing thing to talk about Well when you put like the water in the bottle and then you like freeze it then you unfreeze it then there s less water than what you started with and it probably would change the mass Why is it so you re saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out Yeah Do you have a reason why that might be Well no it s just Okay any other ideas on this one Okay how many people thought the mass would increase then How many people said the mass would increase A couple of you Jared why don t you tell us why you think the mass would increase I thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice Like if you pick up a bottle of water that s frozen it doesn t weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it Okay So Jared says that water weighs more than ice Correct Anybody else have a different idea Anna Well because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass so if it thawed back out then it d weigh more Okay So Anna s using the example that she s seen ice floating on water therefore she s saying the ice must have less mass than water Correct Is that what your e saying Mm hmm Colby you got something to say about that I have something to say about that It will stay the same going off of what she s saying Oh going off of what she s saying Okay go ahead then Ice is pretty much the same as it s water it s frozen water so it still has the same density as water it s just colder So if it s colder it floats Ice because it s cold it floats in the water So you re saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass it has to do with its temperature Kay Houston Well I think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn t completely full There s some air in there Okay So Houston s saying there s some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand Okay Anybody else Anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the Oh sorry Anna Oh okay I disagree with Colby how he said that it floats because it s cold when heat rises and so if it s cold wouldn t it sink if it had to do with the temperature Okay so Anna s saying that heat rises and cold sinks so you don t think it has to do with temperature Yeah Okay Colby response to that or are you Well in water it works differently Warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually and cold water s more on the top Alright So if you put cold in ice it will float above Okay Oh I have some hands up now Michael Well when you re in the lake for example the warm part s on top and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises So you re using your experience in swimming or something in a lake Yeah It s colder the deeper you go warmer towards the surface you re saying Yeah so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath we float up Okay When we have no air we go down Okay so you re saying an ice cube has air trapped in it that s what s causing it to float Is that what you re saying And Hannah were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing Yeah so when you put your sweater or something in the water it s like the top is usually more warm colder Okay Alright Now people who think the mass is going to stay the same Who are those people Who thinks the mass will stay the same Gavin why don t you give us the reason why you think it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because nothing s lost when it melts Nothing goes away It s still the same thing He s saying it s going to stay the same because nothing is lost When it melts it doesn t get lost Okay Anybody else who says it s going to stay the same have something to add Gabe I said that Just talk louder I said that it ll stay the same because there s still the same amount of water melted or frozen and even if it s in a bag if it melts and tries to break down into gas then it s still in the bag so it won t go anywhere So Gabe s saying that it doesn t matter if it s frozen as an ice cube if it s melted as water or even he s even going as far as saying that even if the water liquid starts turning into a gas it s still going to be the same because nothing s leaving the bag Is that what you re saying He s going even a step further he didn t even mention anything about turning into a gas but he s saying even if it does that it s still not going to change Right Houston Well I disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top it doesn t freeze all the water Okay Hannah I agree with what he said Even if there s air bubbles in the ice then after it melts the air bubbles it s still in the bag It s still concealed in the bag So sounds like the people who are for it staying it s the same are really sticking with the fact that everything s in the bag Nothing s out of the bag or leaving or coming in and then the people who are thinking it s going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid and then some of that s through the temperature Michael one more before we move on About how it all stays in the bag well when you melt water it sweats So wouldn t it lose some of that So are you saying some of the moisture s going to be on the outside of the bag Like comes off the bag If you have it on the table then it comes onto the table Like how it has a Okay so here s my question to you then That water that s on the outside of the bag that you re talking about You were saying that water came from the inside of the bag Well it sweats from the the compression of the temperature So you re saying that s what s causing the mass to go up then Wouldn t that cause the mass to go down Okay so that s my question to you then is where was that water on the outside coming from Inside How is it getting to the outside I don t know Some scientific theory Okay Does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside Yeah Do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out James how do you think that water might be getting to the outside The moist is like when it What s it called Wait a minute The carbonate the condensation it like seeps out like the air it seeps out So somehow you re thinking it s seeping through the bag Colby I know how that happens actually Because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it s colder So it ll stick there and just condense there so it ll look like it s It s just water from the air So you re saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside It s coming from the outside which is different than what they re saying Cameron did you have any other ideas how it might be getting out there Kay Alright So we got some different ideas on that one Let s move on now to our alka seltzer problem This time last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease Let s start with the people who think the mass will increase So people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka seltzer Who are those people Alright We re going to have Kyle start us off on this one What s your reason why Kyle Well when the tablet dissolves I think after dissolving water will rise and make more Make more water Yeah Okay So Kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water and therefore more mass Sam different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase Okay so you re thinking it s going to increase because you re adding something to the water Colby I think it s going to increase because the alka seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside Okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass Jake you had your hand up for the mass increasing correct Do you have a different reason why it s going to do that So basically saying the same thing as Colby More gases Hannah Aren t the gases from the water in the alka seltzer aren t they going to just stay the same Good question So what you re saying then is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water so what are you saying the mass will do I think it s going to stay the same Actually it ll decrease It ll decrease Okay why do you think it s going to decrease I don t know Okay Who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease Cameron Why is it going to decrease Because the acid from the from the from the tablet the acid from the tablet is going to release gases and the water will go out of the beaker How is the water going to get out of the beaker Because the tablet will react with water and the gases will float away But isn t there a lid on top Maybe the lid will pop off or something Let s assume the lid is does not pop off Let s assume I have it on there tight enough that it s not going to pop off Then since air is lighter than water then that means that the air that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much and there will be more gas in the container So Correct me if I m wrong So you re saying that assuming the top stays on it s still going to decrease That s the decrease right Because the solid and liquid are going to turn into Gas Gas and gas is lighter than solids and liquids Is that correct What you re saying Yeah Alright Jared has something to say about that I think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be decrease Okay so he s saying that the tablet disappears then the mass will go down That piece that the tablet s bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore Kevin what are you thinking Pretty much the same thing that the tablet s going to dissolve into the water And so mass will go down Yeah Okay Who thinks the mass is going to stay the same It s not going to change Who thinks it will stay the same Why don t you tell us why it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because the water the alka seltzer piece is a water it s just in a different form But everything is still Okay So you re saying because nothing s going away it s still going to be the same It s just in a different form So kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water Gabe do you have a different reason than that No it was a lot like hers It was the same as hers pretty much Yeah Okay Anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka seltzer one Why it might go up down or stay the same before we move on Gavin I said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle it ll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water like the same amount Okay so you re going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet And since we re turning them into gases the mass will go down James I said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked once it mixes with the water it ll stand making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher The mass will increase because it ll produce the Alright Let s go to burning paper Alright Burning paper Let s start with the people this time let s start with the people who think the mass will stay the same People who think the mass still stay the same Colby s the only one Morgan Gabe Not very many Jasmine Morgan why don t you start us off for why you think it s going to stay the same I said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it s not going anywhere Okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere Jasmine you had your hand up Do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same I agree with her You agree with what she said Colby Burning stuff does not add It s still the object but it s more spread apart Okay so the mass stays the same you said It s just we re going to take up more space with it Okay Michael No Yes I was stretching Hannah I disagree with that because it when it burns I don t know if that s the word for it but how it s causing it all when you burn wood in a fire eventually all that will turn into ashes so I don t think it has the same mass or anything Okay James you got some more on that When that paper burns it ll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper and then that ll make it so mass will be decreased Okay so given the idea that we re taking the solid things and we re changing them into maybe non solids so either liquids or liquid acids they re not gonna have as much mass as those Edward what do you think Do you think this mass will go up down or stay the same I think it will decrease Decrease Yeah And what s your reason for that Cause when the paper burns it turns into a gas so some of it and then gas is has less mass than solid objects Okay so again back to that gas is less mass than solid objects Kayla what do you think Increase Decrease Or stay the same I thought it would decrease like what Hannah It ll disintegrate Okay So as a quick vote how many people thought on this one oh sorry Kevin go ahead Also I think it s gonna decrease because the paper s gonna burn and incinerate but also the match when you light the match it s gonna burn too Okay Some of you maybe forgot about the match I haven t heard you mention it until just now so that not only is the paper gonna burn up but so will at least part of the match Okay cause it s burning too alright A quick vote How many people on this one said the mass would go down would decrease And how many said it would increase And how many said it d stay the same So the majority of you are on the decrease side on this Okay here s my next question We ve now heard what a bunch of people had to say about each different situation One if it would increase or decrease or stay the same My question to you now is that after listening to all the people throw ideas out there has anybody changed their mind on any of these In other words like maybe for the ice in the water one I was thinking it was going to increase but after listening to every one now I think it s gonna decrease 
 Now what you just did was count how many times you made a successful Eric you made a successful throw and how many times you made a successful catch out of 10 All right we re going to use that information that you just gathered to answer the questions on this form that you ve got You each should have your own reflection sheet all right and I m going to allow you to as a group as a partnership I m going to allow you to talk about the answers together which is just fine because with your partner helping you you might learn something about your throwing ability or catching ability that you might not have picked up on your own All right so Now if you look at the backside if you start here each of you should have your sheet in front of you OK and you should have a pencil or you have and I m going to read this to you to help you best understand it This is a chart to help you gauge your abilities and for your progress from the start of throwing the Frisbee up to this point It s broken up into four categories One you see where I m pointing at here It says Beginning Two Developing Three Proficient and Four Excellent So the question you have to ask yourself is Am I still in beginning stages of throwing Frisbee In other words do I use correct Frisbee throwing form sometimes Two it says Do I use correct form some to most of the time Three proficient Do I use correct form when throwing the Frisbee or catching the Frisbee most of the time And four excellent Do I use correct form all of the time All right So this is what you are going to test yourself on I ll read it to you and as I read it to you I want you to mark the boxes Again you can talk to your partner and make this assessment with your partner if you d like So sitting with your partner you re talking about it I m going to read it as we go Number one movement Do you move to meet the Frisbee s expected location Are you at the beginning stages of that developing stages proficient stages or are you excellent at it Do you always move to meet the Frisbee s location Sometimes most of the time or rarely Give yourself a check in the box of where you think that belongs Body position OK this is how you position yourself to the oncoming Frisbee aside from moving to it this is how you square your body with it Are you in the beginning stages where you rarely do it well are you in the developing stages where you do it sometimes the proficient stages where you do it most of the time or are you in the excellent stage where you do it all of the time Ask yourself that question Feel free to discuss it with your partner All right so you should be checking the boxes You should be checking the boxes That s right there The boxes are already checked Next Hand position When catching the Frisbee do you use proper hand positioning with your palms together fingers opening rarely That makes you in the beginning stage Sometimes That s your developing stage Do you do it most of the time That puts you in the proficient stage Do you do it always That puts you in the excellent stage What do you think What is your target What would you put a grade on Now when it comes to the throwing the same things apply Your stance and your elbow Are you at the beginning And I m not going to go into detail with each one of these now I think you get the idea of how these check Are you at the beginning stage the developing stage the proficient stage or the excellent stage When it comes to your stance and your elbow position When it comes to wrist snap and point OK what stage are you at Are you rarely sometimes mostly or always Again beginning developing proficient or excellent And then lastly when it comes to releasing the Frisbee what stage do you think you re at the beginning the developing the proficient or the excellent So I want you to just think about that reflect on that but I m not grading you on this I m not grading you on your ability Hey Mike would you sit up for me Thanks bud I want you just to reflect on what you have learned and your ability All right Now with your partner I want you to turn the page over and it says Frisbee throw reflections OK and then we have some questions that we need to answer We discussed what angular momentum was we discussed what force absorption was and we discussed what force reduction was With your partner I want you to answer those questions that you see one through seven Number one why is angular momentum important Two describe force reduction Three describe force absorption Four considering You don t have to do this I m just reading them out loud before you do it Considering the fitness components of speed agility endurance and balance to which sports would you compare Ultimate Frisbee If you think about when we were playing Ultimate the game of Ultimate what sports would you compare that to Football No you have do it with your partner And a couple more questions Where can Frisbee be played for fun What are two popular Frisbee activities that you are aware of You already know one that we played in class You might know of another two And then lastly based on the activity you did just before we sat here how many times did you catch your Frisbee out of 10 and how many times did you accurately throw the Frisbee out of 10 OK So go ahead with your partner and go ahead and start answering those questions to the best of your ability You guys should be working off one another and sharing your answers ready set go Do we basically No just rewrite it Force absorption You absorb the force when you Describe force absorption Yeah OK start with that and maybe go a little farther and describe what makes it To learn today We re going to begin a unit on indoor ultimate frisbee and we ve got the indoor soft styrofoam frisbee all right One thing about the frisbee I want you to understand number one it s styrofoam That means you can easily break them All right please don t bend them like I m doing here any more than I just did Obviously tugging on them pulling them poking them is going to harm the frisbee You want it to be intact so just use the frisbee as it s meant to be used and don t play with it in any other way okay So that way we keep the frisbee in good shape Now here is the question we want to answer why do frisbees fly A lot of different reasons and a lot of these reasons have to do with the concept of flight All right like an airplane like a helicopter or a paper airplane okay Now frisbee flight s a little different than some other types of flight Firstly we re going to look at this angular momentum big word but the concept of angular momentum essentially means that frisbees fly one of the reasons why frisbees fly and maintain stability in flight is because they spin So the fact that the frisbees spin is called angular momentum All right and again that s what produces stability in the air You find angular momentum in a lot of things You guys ever use a top a spinning top Yes at home That s an act of a football as a top If I just balance this football it ll fall right It doesn t remain upright But when I spin the football like a top it maintains its upright position That is angular momentum That is why it does not fall down The force of friction will eventually slow down the football and that s why it will topple over and fall but while it s spinning angular momentum is what keeps it up When a frisbee spins the reason why it doesn t wobble in flight and fall from the air is because it s supposed to spin as you can see there and that s what keeps it stable That s also what helps us to throw it accurately Another concept is angular lift Angular lift like an airplane There s different pressures above and below the wing These concepts are really complicated if you look into them in detail but the basic gist of this concept is that there s a low pressure on top and a high pressure on the bottom and when I throw the airplane that pressure difference is what gives it lift and allows it to fly okay Now one thing I m going to do before I throw this airplane is I m going to use force Force production I produce force behind the plane and that allows it to fly In the same way I will produce force behind the frisbee and that will allow it to fly The other end is force absorption which we ll talk about in just a minute So again aerodynamic lift is when the pressure differences allow this airplane to lift and I m going to produce force for that to happen Can I go get it No we ll leave that there all right Now I need one person to demonstrate how to throw the frisbee properly Julia please I ll have you stand here now watch You re going to listen I m going to go over this one time with you and then you re going to use these checklists on the cones to teach one another how to do it properly Now I know a lot of you listen please I know a lot of you would like when you do the frisbee you can throw the frisbee but there s one The difference between really just throwing the frisbee and understanding how to throw the frisbee Understanding the mechanics behind it okay So the mechanics behind throwing a frisbee are just this the mechanics behind a frisbee are this number one I need to know my target Two when throwing a frisbee you step with the same foot Not the opposite foot like when you throw a baseball but rather I step with the same foot I m going to point my elbow at my target I m going to curl my wrist and bring the frisbee across my chest Girls I need you to pay attention If you miss this instruction it s going to be more complicated later So I m going to step towards my target frisbee curled up to my chest and then point my elbow at my target Now when I extend my elbow I m going to snap my wrist That s going to create the spin that gives this one two three Angular momentum Angular momentum And that s what s going to give it stability So I m going to step point the elbow snap the wrist point to my target produce force and on the other end what Julia s going to do once I throw it is she s going to use force absorption She s going to catch it Fundamentals of catching Julia what I d like you to do is square yourself with the frisbee If the frisbee moves to your right I want you to move to your right okay If it moves to your left I want you to move to your left Because you want to meet it and square your body to it And last I want you to put your hands in this position palms together and fingers out All right they don t have to be touching but we re going to try to pancake the frisbee All right hopefully my throw goes well Here we go Step elbow oh wrist snap release One more thing I forgot to mention release it level with the ground If I release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way if I release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way So release it level one more thing to remember Ready Step nice try Don t laugh don t laugh All right I want you to try the same thing I want you to step with the same foot point your elbow in and when you throw throw it point your finger at me remember to release it level You re ready go Yes It s all right you can grab it with one hand there s no problem with that That frisbee had good spin on it all right She released it did she release it level No No that s why it bounced off the wall One more time step elbow wrist snap point release level Good catch Nice one dude Here you go you got it Perfect Now I could have moved to the side a little bit to catch that frisbee but I did a little reach and that s okay too All right so with your groups of four remember wait wait wait You re going to coach your partner in throwing and catching use the checklist on the cones Ready set grab one frisbee go Can I stand here You and you here You re going to be here You guys are all working together you re going to hold this Wait wait wait There should be two on each cone one person holding the cone Stop where s your partner You re going to coach her throwing You re going to go first and I want you to catch it and then throw it to her and you re going to be catching and every couple tries we re going to switch Okay pick up your cone and coach Pick up your cone You re the instructor he s going to catch right All right You re the instructor you should watch her One two three frisbee Make sure you re reading and helping All right practice a couple times and three stop Stop stop stop Now with the catch with the force absorption okay You re absorbing that throw listen I know that the throws aren t all going to be accurate that s all the more reason why you have to move to where you think the frisbee s going to land and meet the oncoming frisbee okay So with your partner s help coach s help keep practicing and we re going to switch in just a minute Make sure you correct any improper technique 
 What are some other indicators that tell us I m in my target heart rate range Yes By the categories on your RPE chart Okay your RPE Chart you could use that That s exactly right How about within your body What s something that your body can tell you that you re in that target heart rate range Yes young lady Um the way you breath and how you re feeling Okay good your breathing your feeling some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin to hurt and your thighs are startin to be sore All those things are physical ways that your body s sayin Hey I m doin a good job in this workout I m within my target heart rate range When we do this today I want you to kind of take a mental picture Let take a mental picture of This is how my body feels when I m in my target heart rate range Whether your lower end or higher end take a mental picture so that when you re out walking or not walking but when you re out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that you can kind of have an idea how you re feelin with those with those things and you can know whether you re close to being in your target heart rate range Now one of the last things is is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history from heart disease to high blood pressure those types of things The cardio workout that we re doin today what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you Who knows that What are some of those areas Okay Let s get you there Amy It ll help prevent heart disease high blood pressure and diabetes Okay the heart disease that s exactly right Good cardio high blood pressure it s gonna bring the blood pressure down Also diabetes Along with high blood pressure you got high cholesterol All of those areas cardio is going to positively impact those areas Okay The yes What do I need to lose weight Okay to lose weight That s a question I get a lot of time If you want to lose weight ideally you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range or about 80 however you do actually at about you do burn more cal fat calories at about 60 but you re gonna burn more calories at 80 because it s a more intense workout okay So really ideally you d want to be within your target heart rate range Typically up towards the higher end will be a little better because if you re gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end Okay Any other questions on anything All right we re gonna get started here You ve already got your target heart rates there I want you to look here and I want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is What is your zone And we ll notice this most of you you know we ve all figured it out You ll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand or where most of you are gonna be in the chart We start all the way down at 100 go all the way up to above 176 You ll start to see that that most likely that 151 to 175 that s gonna be our biggest area here that we re gonna fall into You can see right there we re at 75 So most of you in here where s our target heart rate range In between Between 151 and 175 There you go between 151 and 175 That is right on the money for young adults your age If you re at that 176 or higher that s not a problem but that is an area where you know anything over about 185 or so then it just means that you ve got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people So most people though again are gonna be in that 151 to 175 That s a good job Okay go ahead and go to your machines here Lay your clip boards off to the side If you want to listen to your ipod or to your music you can only one ear phone though only one ear piece Make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there we ll do something with those a little bit later And where we re gonna start with here is we re gonna start together We re gonna start with a two minute workout On this workout two minute warm up All we re gonna do is get warmed up You need to be out on the bike somewhere around 40 rpms Ellipticals about the same thing 35 to 40 rpms On the treadmills around three speed will be a good good place to start with Is everybody good we ready to go Yes Are we good back there You all set Okay all right here we go Startin on two minutes And start All right so make sure that we got those magnets on there Bump that up to about three or so Just to get warmed up This is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit Now at the end of this warm up we re gonna check where your heart rate is we re gonna check that and you ll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to compared to you know what it was for a resting heart rate You most likely will not be though in your target heart rate zone right here after this warm up About halfway through Good job Anytime you work folks you should always do a warm up Now we ve already stretched and done some a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here So you ve got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up Don t jump right in to it You re gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk for you Good job everybody doin good Yes As we do this I m gonna come along and ask you where you are on your RPE chart periodically Cause I want to know how your body s feeling Just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are Okay Let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Real quick put your hands on the sensors let s get that heart rate checked As soon as you get that heart rate check go ahead and stop your machine hop off and we re gonna record that under heart rate one real quick under the warm up Okay stop your machine there Record that heart rate As soon as we get this go ahead lay those back off to the side we re gonna hop back over here and we re gonna start goin through the workout Now the workout s gonna be 10 minutes Again bikes you outta be pumpin out about 80 to 85 of your RPMs there Ellipticals probably somewhere between 70 and 75 We really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you re within that target heart rate zone Anybody right now in their target heart rate zone No No A little bit elevated from the resting though Yes Okay all right Let s go ahead and start At the five minute mark we will check it again and we will check that heart rate what your heart rate is We won t get off the machines again until the work out s over Caroline Now again on your own once we get into this a couple minutes on your own if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors you re more than welcome to do that You just don t want to do it the whole time you re working out and that ll kind of give you an idea where you re standing If you need if you re below your lower end of that target heart rate go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit if that s the case as we continue on through this Are you all doin good Where are we on the chart At 3 That s good You all could do this for an hour huh There you go How you doin over there Where are you on your chart Two That s good Three Three Two I d say around two Two Two Ladies how we doin over here How you feelin on your chart Three Three Yeah You good Russell Yeah Okay Andy how you feelin Where are you on your chart About four How do you feel good Where are you on your chart Doin good Most of you you re all about a two three four range right now Now we re just getting to the start of the work out but here in a few minutes that s probably gonna change Might be changing right now Probably startin to feel a little bit of fatigue breathing s becoming a little bit more difficult We re gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes Again remember I want you mental picture in your mind How is my body feeling when I m in that target heart rate range Doing a good job good job Okay we got one more minute and we re gonna get a heart rate check here If you re feelin like your in that 4 to 6 range you might be able to go ahead and up your up your intensity just a little bit there up your speed maybe up your resistance a little bit Russell did you forget to put your phone on vibrate Yeah That s all right buddy Just don t mess with it while you re on the bike okay I mean while you re on the treadmill Okay Okay hard to do hard to do anything with a phone while you re running All right let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Get a quick check Remember what this number is This is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart We want to be within that range now If you re not we need to up your resistance If you re at the lower end I want to try to get on up towards the higher end about that 80 mark So if that s the case bump your speed a little bit up your resistance if you need to We re gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes About 65 I m in my range Nice nice Where are you on your RPE chart Uh about four About four Four or five Hey anytime you know if you re saying God I just can t get my heart rate up there if you re on the treadmill increase that elevation a little bit Elliptical if you increase the resistance then you ll start to feel it How s Callie back here She s startin to get it right now aren t ya How are you all on your chart Five or six Where are you all on your chart Five Five Six Where are you guys on your chart probably around four Ladies how we doin Where are you on your chart About six Six Yes How are you Russell Six seven How about you Six Six Dale where are you Three four Three four You need to increase your resistance I mean your elevation a little bit How about you Four Four Most of you are comin up on that chart Comin up Okay we re gettin ready to do another check here Good A couple more minutes here Everybody doing okay Yup Are you startin to feel some of the signs we talked about fatigue in the legs Yes I know it s hard to talk right now A little more difficult breathing Startin to feel it a little bit more now aren t you yeah a little bit How s it going back here My legs are like rubber So now you know you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same RPMs One mile Kyle Okay in thirty seconds here we re gonna get a heart rate check Then we re going into the cool down You really push it right here You re about to jump off the elliptical aren t you Good Okay let s get a heart rate check here Heart rate check Grab those sensors Remember this number When you get this number when you ve got this go ahead and bring your speed on down We re goin into the cool down phase Make sure you remember what that number was What was your heart rate Uh 170 I m about 169 In your cool down phase now There you go good good Did we get in there in your range in your range Everybody in your range Great good job Did you stay in heart rate range Good Now did anybody on that RPE chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine Yes You did Yes Up there All right Did ya ll get in your range Yup Did you get within your range Was ya ll on your upper end or towards the lower end Upper end Tried to go up How about you guys Did you get in your range there Yeah Yeah Now here in about 45 more seconds we re gonna get our last check here on the cool down You ll notice how quickly as you do this you ll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout and even after this two minute cool down here the difference between where that heart rate drops to Are ya ll okay Okay let s go ahead and get that last heart rate check 
 We started testing out our theory that it s an exponential Cause we found out that the ratios Does that verify that it s an exponential equation We thought it did but it doesn t So why aren t you sure I don t know So the more disks I add I m eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that I can make Isn t that a logistic function So logistic function would say that you re gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make And it would say at some point you re gonna slow down the number of moves you re adding on Does that make sense based on what you ve done so far No not at all What do you think is gonna happen instead That it would increase And what would that be That s the exponential But the numbers are all really long decimals So I heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this So have you looked at your scatter plot Yes Okay What might be other ways to change an exponential function I can get it out of my backpack Based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio Before you did any of the arithmetic what did you think your ratio might be Small I don t know I didn t really think it was two automatically But two s in your head Why is two in your head Because doubling Because there s doubling Here s what I m gonna suggest to you guys You ve got your scatter plot on Marissa s calculator right You re thinking that two might have been the ratio Why don t you graph two y equals two to the X and compare it to what s happening on your scatter plot and see if there s a different way that you might be able to change the extremum It s increasing by a factor of 2 She s trying it in an actual game Normally I d want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds We re at 20 so what s your goal 27 28 29 30 31 Good job Caitlyn Good job Now I m convinced that that works You re seeing that the difference is doubling each time correct What kind of function is that suggesting Exponential And what do you suspect is probably your factor Two Two So that s what I want you to look at How could you verify that it s an exponential function using any of the tools you have here Once you ve found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is There is a little bit of a trick to this one It has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions Okay Figure out that When you get stuck again let me know and I ll be back So you think that s two to the power of X minus one Why did you get minus one Because with one it worked fine but with two when you try to put in X as the exponent two to the X so two times two is four So far X minus 1 is the exponent What I m hearing is that you re convinced that the factor is two And you re trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here is that correct Talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you re adding the one at the end Because there has to be at least one move We added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first Oh wait that doesn t work though If you have one so two to the zero is 1 And one plus one is two but that s Tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end You said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one Is it a piece of the function That would be really mean We were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end I think you guys are in a great place I think you ve got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table So try more with the transformation I also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move but I would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves that s just that you need at least one move Alright I m going to leave you guys to think I ll come back So we found the equation but now we re stuck at number four Okay so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it The difference between I was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference so how it would relate to the y values We saw the two to the x we figured oh well two to the four to the 16 Well how do we get to 15 minus one This is going back to the algebra from last year So you saw that you had two to the x You noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra You also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot Did it lie directly on your scatter plot No So what do you mean by it matched up It was close It was the same curve So how did you know that created a transformation Because whether it depends on the number or which value it is It changed the steepness of it So we just knew it transformed it somehow Like we had to have it It wasn t the parent function So what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x How did you know that Because if you d done four times two to the x you would have stretched it Because it would have moved to the left too on the graph And what did that end up doing to your y intercept Okay so that would be my next question for you I agree with you guys that definitely there s a transformation I agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables you ve done a nice job with that So how does a transformation what you ve done is you ve taken two to the x what does the minus one do Does that move this to the left Move it up or down Well if you graph it It moves it up Okay So Jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function And you re saying that you don t think the slope changes Okay so you change the y intercept And do you have a change in the y intercept It s still zero comma zero So you just had two to the x Find out just two to the x What s the y intercept of the graph What happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that The y intercept moved down And does that match what we ve been talking about You take the function and subtract the value and move down one Alright you guys said you were stuck on number four Yeah Okay Why are you stuck So we figured out that you put But the minus one doesn t do anything Yeah the numbers are so big that it doesn t matter It actually does change the actual number a little teeny tiny bit But our calculator can t see that number It looks like the same number on your calculator So we have a number of moves If each move is a second then how long is it gonna take for the world to end Alright now you guys are also at the challenge question down here Which is based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved Why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made Okay And I ll be back in a little bit I m going to give you guys about seven more minutes You should answer question four before you try that So I got it kind of close Looking at just I did what you do to find a normal exponential equation I plugged in y two over y one and then to the square root of four And are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours No You guys are correct that this is exponential But if we re not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation is on the right track So I really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values Okay I m gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group Try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have Alright what have you guys got Our answer was 30 Talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works I realized that the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one So you just have that in your head Did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head We didn t graph it We used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one Went to the table and it was the same numbers And I noticed here you ve got 2 to the 64th minus one What s that for That s from another number It s like a really high number One point eight times Two to the 19th While you guys figure out how long it s gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number I d also like you to think about the answer to the challenge You guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved So I d like you to think about why your function has two to the x Why are you doubling those 
 So here s the first set I thought I d start a little bit easy So go ahead and within your groups now I ll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate how to figure out which one it is Okay Go ahead You can uh You can you use Beer s Law for this right You aren t able to taste that You aren t able to that s not big enough Our Okay so Doesn t dissociate How s the temperature Boil it Yeah that s the only way So the one with the highest concentration s going to have the highest boiling point Yeah You could freeze it and weigh it Okay freezing it The point three would have the most weight Weight Yeah But which one would freeze first Point one Point one would freeze first because there s less Okay What else Point three weighs more But we would need to freeze it first no What We wouldn t need to freeze it The first one being would be with the tasting one Or the volume one I don t know the tasting one Okay you say the tasting one you say the volume one Whichever one comes first The one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one right Okay So the one that boils the fastest Point one You could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes Alright So we can have equal volumes of each solution right And then after like a certain time Alright that s it Everybody stop Stop stop stop Okay So who want to go first We ll start with with Miles I think you had your hand up first so go ahead What s one way that you can identify these things Well you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0 3 molar 0 2 would be the middle and 0 1 would be the least Okay If they were all the same volume Ahh Yeah You guys heard that now Good Good listening skills on that If they were the same volume at the beginning alright Does everybody agree So one method is boil away and weigh Did you say weigh How do you know which one has the most I would imagine you could weigh it right You could weight it Start with equal volumes Okay There s several other ways How about Joseph If you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration Okay Anybody have comments on that Jimmy I don t think we re able to distinguish the taste that well Because our mouth isn t that sensitive Okay Miles What if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there So there s two concerns Obviously I think Miles is the most important You know you guys can see that I m smart enough to put the right substances I keep forgetting I m getting old And I may go in the back and I reach for the lead nitrate or something right And then the other part what do you guys think of the other part Could you taste the difference between a 0 2 0 3 and a 0 1 And just say Ah that s the sweetest one It s kind of hard Miles You d need some salt The problem I think is this is something we would actually need to try right I don t think this is a theoretical thing that we re trying to we re practicing theory here We would actually have to do this in a lab right I would imagine we would Wouldn t it be different for every person Because we could It could be different for every person right Because I can t see as well as you for example maybe right So there could be variations in tasting of those Ian Given excess humans Oh wait You re on the next one No on this one Alright I didn t get that either Okay so let s look at another method alright We re not going to list that one because we don t want to be tasting things Okay so Paran your group What about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0 1 would have the most and 0 3 would have the least because there s more sugar covering it What do you guys think Okay Juan He didn t say how you could measure it The way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure Everybody agree Yeah Okay So that was my concern too right How do you measure the vapor pressure You re not wrong But how do measure it And thank you Juan for bringing that up Could you repeat that Okay so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they d always be evaporating The one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0 1 molar would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time So I m going to write this as evaporation rate Who s got another method Different view Alright Jimmy Okay so you re gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light Whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Then the second one is 0 2 the last one 0 1 What do you guys think Could you repeat that So you re going to take equal amounts take it into the light make sure it s the same conditions for each one and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Second is 0 2 last is 0 1 What do you guys think I know some of you guys are thinking that s bio but you took it most of you at least right So we could finish this What do you think Wouldn t it take a long time for the algae to start growing It s going to work right Nobody sees Where s the algae You re always asking me Come one folks You think about this I m going to say the problems But I want you to tell me first alright Alright let s go with Ivan I don t think the results would be consistent Because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason So because you didn t mention how much algae you put in there could be an issue there What else though No Juan you go alright I don t think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place So I think Juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things Not just amount of sugar and amount of water There could be other nutrients is that what you re saying Yeah Nutrients and other things of that sort Could I just back up for a sec Algae produces sugar right Assuming that you re talking about algae that grows they use carbon dioxide So my hunch is there s several right One I think as Ivan pointed out you ve got to put in a certain amount Why don t you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end You picked algae so yeah Although is that a bad idea It could work but we have to be careful with conditions A lot of conditions need to be met Anything else You boil them Hold on Let these guys go If you have equal volumes and you add heat to them 0 1 should boil first Okay so you could use boiling point Elevation I wrote this down before we even discussed it But everybody agrees that works right So what s another easy one that we boiling point elevation right You need me to repeat that or you got it What immediately follows with that idea Freezing point depression Freezing point depression Okay what else I have a question for you then Could we use Beer s Law for this No Tell me why Could we use Beer s Law for this Ian you have your hand up At first glace I would say no because I do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution What do you guys think Yep Don t you need color Unless what Unless Come on keep going with this stuff Not you Ian You spoke I d like to have as many people participate as possible Alright Nick go ahead You could add food coloring possibly Yeah you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker possibly Nick we re trying to figure out the difference between these right Yeah What do you mean add You mean add a drop to each of these Yeah But then what would you be measuring The food coloring You wouldn t be measuring the sugar You know what I mean Yeah I know what you mean You re still okay with that Uh I don t know Wait Nick If you add food coloring how much One drop Yeah Okay One drop to each of these right Now they all look the same Don t they Yeah And if I stick this in my spectral photometer they should all measure the same Did I succeed in figuring out which one is which You understand that right Yeah yeah Okay Nat Could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads That s interesting Could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads You d have to indicate that high concentration would Teacher Hang on But once again we have to be careful of conditions right All the temperatures have to be the same What do you guys think Sure Why would that work Because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it s not able to spread through the molecules So that would be in the 0 3 Science Glad you like it Alright How about wait Gevorg hasn t spoken So I m thinking Gevorg it s your turn buddy What did you want to add You wanted to add a new technique Okay go ahead If we did a Benedict s Test I don t know if it would just turn the same color because I m not sure how the Benedict s reacts with different concentrations But maybe if you put the same amount of Benedict s and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test What do you guys think Benedict s is a reaction between this Benedict s stuff with sugar to show the presence of sugar What comes out of the reaction I m not sure but it s a color change Oh well the more color change But if the color change is too intense it could just be like it s all going to change that color or not see what I m saying That s what your pointing out right So again that sounds like an experimental one Could I share one more How about this You know when you take your AP test you just don t know what And we started with something that I think is sort of easy Could you use density What do you guys think Someone who hasn t talked yet Could we use density And how do we use density What do you guys think No Alright Ian Since nobody s going for it Do I have to say it Go ahead and say it Tell me how Tell us how Take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it Exactly Which one s going to weigh the most The one that has the most sugar okay If you take equal volumes this one will weigh the most This will be the most dense The more sugar you add the denser it gets You know this right Does anybody have any more Alright let s move on Set number two Now this says solid and I m trying to get you to see a different range on these Go ahead and talk about it I ll give you a minute or so Colors Conductivity We could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity Well they re solid You have to remember So solid has a lot of problems with it That s just solving it It s hard to conduct a current Well you could dissolve it It s doable It s just a little difficult Potassium Then um Wait calcium What about pH sensing So CACL2 Well they re solids Oh if you put them into a solvent Yeah Can we put them into solvents Can we make it into So lead can t dissolve in water right Lead I mean lead chloride No lead chloride will not dissolve in water But then KCL and CACL2 would They would So you can rule that out That s one way But then how do you figure out between the other solution Couldn t there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate I wouldn t say form a precipitate I would say Actually I m thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn t dissolve at all with boiling point elevation freezing point depression because you re going to have more little bits in the CACL2 than the KCL As an end result calcium chloride potassium chloride get what PBCL2 does nothing So after that if you boil it right Calcium chloride potassium the higher value Alright you guys That s it Let s gather up Okay Some of you guys just got back so you guys know what we re doing right Yes Okay Let s get it together Alright everybody stop now Christina you had your hand up first Take the easiest one What s the easiest way to distinguish these You could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest and the KCL would be the lightest Equal volumes I mean equal amounts What s an amount though Like grams But if I take equal grams then I could have ten grams of this ten grams of this ten grams of that No I didn t say that Alright what did you say then I meant like equal Equal what Volume Volume okay Now let s answer that one What do you guys think She s saying take let s say 10 milliliters 10 milliliters 10 milliliters And this one s going to weigh the most This one would weigh which one s second Oh sorry Second would be CACL2 Okay so this one would be second What do you guys think Someone other than Ian Okay Ian go ahead Does atomic weight atomic mass directly influence Listen to this Miles Does atomic mass directly influence density That s the question Does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids They re all ionic compounds And the answer to that is no You cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass that this is the most dense Okay Where just to follow that up where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works Ivan Oh wait let s give it to him Just he s just walked in Niresh Is it in gases Gases right Does everybody agree Gases you could do that If the formula mass is high on a gas then it s going to have more density Could you do that for liquids now Could you do that for liquids Ivan You could do it if it s all the same subsets for different concentrations 
 You each have your own set And I m going to ask you to put them out in front of you in in so you can see all the words Can we put them in two rows One Two three four five six Let s put them in two rows One two three four five six Now I wanna play Wait a minute show me I m going to ask you to point So get your pointer finger in show me under Yes under good Take a look at the word under good Wait keep it there Show me now be careful We want to get all the letters Show me there Listen to the word good Jessica There That s Okay he s gotta look He s gonna do it Very good Put it down Good Ready Alright Be careful with this one listen to my words Ready Show me Saw Good Excellent alright Show me ready They alright Excellent Alright Show me was Wow That s good Show me want Alright now You did a great job Now we re going to hide your words so turn your cards over all by yourself Now you can t see them right Keep them in the rows Good Alright keep them in a row Alright now oh your going to do it that way Okay wait a minute now Now we re going to take turns Let s see who s sitting nicely Alright You re going to turn over a card Lewis and tell me what the word is Put it down Want I want my toys I want my toys yes good You turn over a card Oh what s your word Under I see the cat under the bed alright Lewis turn over another card under oh you got under as well what s your sentence I am hiding under the bed I am hiding under the bed that s a good one Under the table Let s see Jessica go ahead do another one Now think look at your letters was Yes I was eating I was eating Good Look at your letters let them help you Don t help They There There yes There is my toy in the bed There is my toy in the bed Okay alright how about you Jess Oh what do you have There Good can you use it There is a car in my mail There is a car in your mail Wow That would be interesting Alright Lewis your turn Now look at your letters let them help you They Yes They was a cat in my car Okay this there was a cat in my car They tried to get the cat out of the car Okay They belongs means people They Okay Let s see what you have Oh look at you Today is the day Aaah this word is they The children that would be they Let s take a look at this word this is one we are misunderstanding They Jessica and Lewis they came to the reading group Okay They had turkey for Thanksgiving They have alright They came to my birthday They came to my birthday Can you think of a sentence for they They What did your brothers do They play basketball There you go they play basketball there you go that s better Okay You have another card to turn over But it s my turn I got mixed up I got Lakers socks You got what Nothing Say that again What did you say about the I got socks No this is saw This is I saw you when I I saw a movie I saw a big alligator I saw a big alligator I saw a dinosaur I saw a dinosaur Last one was was Okay Where was my friend Where was my friend good I want candy I want candy Okay Now watch what I m going to do I m going to put the cards together I m going to mix them up and I m going to turn them over We re going to play our matching game okay Alright What happened My brother put gum in there and when I point I can t get out of there Oh boy alright now Jessica you went first before right So we have Lewis go first this time Would that be fair Yes Alright Lewis you re going to turn over a card you re going now listen to me Listen to me This is how we re going to play You re going to turn over a card and you re going to read it Then you re going to turn over another card then you re going to read it Wait a minute wait a minute If look at me sweetie If you get a match you want to keep the pair You have to put the word in a sentence Can you do that Let s see Go ahead Okay take a look Take a look take a look Shh don t tell him don t tell him Was This word is was Let s see okay now pay attention Jessica so you can remember where they are Your turn Pick another card Lewis Oh it s so close What word is this Saw saw Okay Here is was Turn it over turn it over And here s saw Good Okay Jessica s turn Want Good want She read it They Not a match Good wait a minute wait a minute wait before you do that Wait before you do that They want They want candy Okay watch Lewis Who remembers what was this one What was this one No peeking Do you remember what it was Jessica Was Was good What was this one Saw What was this one They and what was this one Want Good alright They No its not they Careful take another close look Look at the whole word There Now sorry about that Good good They Is it a match is that a match No but we ve seen that word What s this word They Go to your chair now and sit Okay There and they I m going to hide them again Now let s see if Jessica remembers They and they Okay now stop You want to use it in a sentence Let s see how we do They have a dog They have a dog Good job Alright you get that one Okay Lewis let s see how you do Go ahead You can do it Oh What s that word Under Under Pick another one under No way Alright Under Okay let s see a nice sentence I m going to listen for a good one I am under my brother can t find me because I m under the table Your brother can t find you because you re under the table Can you give me a sentence for under Um I hide under the bed I hide under the bed excellent okay Now it s Jessi Oh Want Do you remember where it was Jessica Wow Now wait a minute let s see if you can think of a sentence Jessica first I want a cake I want a cake What would you want I want a brownie I want a ice cream Okay Okay alright try another one Oh Is that match No No what s this word Lewis They Come back over here and take a good look at it This word is saw Jessica s going to get it Now wait a minute maybe not maybe not saw uh eh eh ah uh was Was okay Yeah but that s okay those two we mixed up Let s take a good close look at them Which one is was Which one is saw Okay alright now listen to your first sound I m going to hide them again Let s see if we can remember Go ahead Lewis Your turn Was and which one Was There you go was Give me a sentence for was I was in my bed I was in my bed Let s hear Jessica s sentence for was I was I was in the bus I was in the bus alright Let s see pick another one Take a look at the first letter Saw Okay and what s that one saw Okay now a sentence for saw Wait a minute before you count your card A sentence for saw I saw something you see oh I saw a saw a candy You saw a candy where was the candy On the floor I saw candy on the floor Did your little brother dump it on the floor Okay I would eat it You have the last one They It s not they I want you to think again Look at all the letters Don t tell him don t tell him There Okay give me a sentence wait a minute give me a sentence with it There was a huge table There was a huge table where In my kitchen There was a huge table in my kitchen before you count your cards can you give me a sentence with the word there There is a snowman at the window There is a snowman on the window what a great sentence How many cards do you have one two three four five six seven I got six Alright we re going to do one more thing with these words to practice We have a word that we are having trouble with We re going to come over here Over to the board We re going to take a look at this word that we re having trouble with Thank you for getting her a marker I m going to ask you to write this word on the board Oh a line you know what she s telling you right Okay let s take a look at this word Are you ready This word is Jess that s good Alright This word is saw Let s see if we can write it Saw Jessica I want you to write saw Look at the word There it is Saw Okay 
 Everybody s using their directions they have their tools and their charts out We ve found today s date so we know where we re going to record today It s Wednesday March Ninth I know what numbers down of zero mean They are negative numbers That s what are numbers that are down from zero OK I have most friends with their hands on their heads I want to make sure everybody s listening and ready to move on We can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them Excellent I m waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads so we can concentrate on the teacher In each group I have one team member that will be measuring temperature If you are measuring the temperature please hold up your tool that you ll be using Those of you measuring the temperature what tool are you using Everybody Thermometer Very good The people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers please line up at the back door of the classroom When you get out there boys and girls are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there What are you going to have to do Look at the thermometer And you can also compare it to the thermometer that s been outside so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside If you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind I would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom You guys can use the compass and work together go ahead out and see what you observe If you have an anemometer to measure wind speed you may line up If you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges you may line up You may all go And last but definitely not least if you are measuring the When we look at this our thingy goes away No yours is 61 No it s the Fahrenheit not the Celsius There s something in there What team are you 66 You guys we need to wait for how many seconds It s not ready yet You ve been doing it at home What is it that you ve been waiting How can it be 110 How can it be Now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around OK So see where your is and get ready to start counting Look at the bee I ve heard both of these ladies say two What you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means What is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds Look with your eye with one eye look at this one I can t see I think it s going West When you have completed measuring you may walk back to your group to record your data Quietly I got 66 Can we compare it to what s on the wall there and see what we have It got 66 then it got 65 and then it got 64 Victor could you explain it all to me why you think you thermometer keeps going down Because it gets colder And where has the thermometer been sitting all day In there And do you think it s cooler out here or is it warmer out here Cooler Exactly So our temperature is going Down Good So let s go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that s been staying outside It s getting brown What do we think the temperature is there It says the temperature is 46 degrees That s probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long All right You can head back in and record I don t know which number to choose The one on the outside the whole time What s your Gym It s on Wednesday March Ninth It was West The wind direction was West The wind direction was West Very good I think that you have an accurate reading What s the wind speed It s cloudy Wind direction temperature Team Three is working together and Team Two and Team One Nice job working together I think you have to change it Temperature Victor What was the temperature 40 degrees 46 degrees Fahrenheit It was 50 What was the wind speed It s not raining So what did you guys think the was I agree with you Why would we forecast that it might rain What s the weather The weather is rainy West Put West It was West It was West We found out that the wind speed we said it went around about that many times so how fast is the wind actually going Minutes Miles per hour We don t go anywhere in a minute We travel like we said in cars in miles Right Go back to your group they ll tell you on the chart My thermometer s higher than the one outside We discussed that while we were standing out there Why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you re holding it inside right now Because inside of you it s warm Because you told us that it was when you re holding the thermometer the thermometer only feels what s around it And if we re covering the thermometer it can t measure any more temperature only how our temperature is Very good So Linda if that answered your question that s why we compared it to the thermometer that s been staying outside that we check each day What are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there 46 degrees Fahrenheit Excellent so make sure you re sharing that and each person in your group use your data Linda I think you ve done an excellent job OK We have a few minutes left and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments I am going to pass out your follow up questions and you re going to use data from last week and compare it to today s data to do some equations on here and you do not have to finish today We will do this in our follow up lesson in our next science lesson OK You may continue working Thank you Write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up OK the wind direction Who should you be asking that to Today s Last Wednesday the temperature was What is the degrees between today s temperature and the temperature last Wednesday Write an equation Show your work Last Wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour What is the difference between You already have your paper I know We can do it by ourselves But it says to work as a team I like it Good job Keep working with your team I hear her saying Excellent I like how I see Brianna using her data And Grace starting to write an equation and Abby and Samaya have the date on their paper You guys are all doing an excellent job Who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went You should ask that person as soon as he comes back he should have his data on his chart What number did you put there We worked together and we figured it out I know this one I know this one I know that one One second 
 Well let s say about like a plane A plane can use the wing to like slice right through the the wind making it just fly with ease but let s say the wing was vertical and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall Okay did everybody hear what he said No Daniel did you understand what Jonathan was saying Yeah Okay so does that make sense to you then Daniel Yeah Okay John About the thing the last part did he say vertical Yeah like like like vertical like pointing upwards Oh Okay What do you think Reese what do you think Um what Jonathan said Jonathan would you kind of say it again Reese would really like to pay attention and he d like to hear Yeah I m saying like like a wing it uses like like like a V shape of a duck of a duck squad Like every single wing goes down each part and then it s just like a V Okay Shayla Um I said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn t fall onto the ground Okay Kelsey Um I think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then I think it would just float in space because there s no gravity Okay we re kind of yeah Ramaji Okay I m kind of lost Ramaji is lost let s help her find herself No that s a good thing Because I ll be honest I m a little lost So tell me where you are Like I thought we were supposed to put like why we think they were built not how they were built like like I wrote um I think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help and new aerospace technology helps build modern things Okay Can everybody understand where Ramaji went with her answers Kelsey I m totally lost now Okay here s what happened okay so let me see if we can find this a different direction Um in reading all your different sentences most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying okay or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air okay and so we re not kind of getting where I want to get to So can I for a second kind of change the discussion Just because Yes John Is it like when you take a rocket like on the rocket it has uh two wings and like one tail Great so his question that he asked does a rocket have two wings and a tail Um here s what s happening Mm I thought the vehicles would help you and what I m seeing is having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made And I m not as concerned about how this vehicle is made okay as I am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way does that make sense Yes Okay so can we go a different way with me for a minute Each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table correct Okay I know I took yours Reese which is why you don t have one now I need to know something okay This vehicle doesn t have an engine okay Okay Now I want you to think about this for a minute and I want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group I want to know how does this hot air balloon fly how does it get in the air and how does it stay in the air And is it possible you don t know anything about this Possibly Possibly It is possible okay it is possible Joelle you don t know anything about this okay So I want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies okay And I m gonna come around and talk to different groups okay So how does this hot air balloon fly Okay so you two start the discussion at this table So discuss that because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don t okay So share in your group Okay what do you two know Okay Has an engine a propulsion engine Okay but is that an engine Okay so now you can do your discussion What did you come up with over here So the fire blows hot air into the balloon Okay without it it would do what It would fall down okay Okay So any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise What do you think Okay okay Ooh that was awesome You are so good today Um I think we re now getting somewhere So let s talk about this hot air balloon for a minute okay So I ve heard some different things around the classroom I want to know how does that balloon get into the air Nathan The fire in the hot air balloon blows the the balloon up to where it can float down Okay Shayla do you agree or disagree I agree with that because yeah because you pull on a cord and like it lights up the fire and stuff and then the fire pulls in air and it like shoots it up with the fire So is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon No air is What kind of air Hot air Hot air is being shot up into this part Okay John Didn t they say one of those like if you compare They can t Jonathan can t hear you Oh sorry If you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon they re you use hot air for the air balloon and you use the helium for a small balloon yeah and the it s not really air kind of I thought it was steam Okay okay Now why would you think it was steam Because you know how when you just um when you put like a fire fire in one place it sometimes can turn into steam Maybe The fire turns into steam No not the fire but like when it s when it s done Ann Maria says she thinks you need the word water Yeah because when you heat up water then steam comes up out of it Because steam is like moisture Steam is like moisture that s In the air In the air okay Ramaji I agree with you John Okay I think what he s saying is because in air and the fire is there or whatever and so then when they re getting pushed up that comes and like then I m lost here Okay like then the steam like yeah you were right about the moisture part but it but there is no way that like water is in this There isn t water in there Yeah I mean Reese be supportive I mean there s moisture in the air but still like fire is a big part of it Okay can I ask a question Okay Do I need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly No no you don t Ramaji says no Laura says no I said no Mariah says no Kelsey I m totally lost Kelsey it s okay to be lost okay Kelsey you re if you re lost you need to know where you are So here s the question what do you feel like you know and understand about what s been discussed so far I thought I was understanding everything until John said I m so confused right now So tell me John was talking about steam John was talking about steam I would agree Kevin John was talking about steam So the question is prior to that Kelsey okay prior to that what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies Basically nothing before that I just think it s steam because of like hot and air because or like there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy Okay let s see if I can bring around some concepts Ramaji and John can you let me have two seconds okay Um we have a concept of this fire that s heating air but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam Correct But I m also hearing and I just want to make sure I understand I m hearing that the steam isn t necessary for the balloon to go up John Well this is this is how I thought it was steam Because you know how sometimes there s clouds and you you want to go up in the air balloon and sometimes it might rain like when you re in the air balloon sometimes it like when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot it actually turns into steam I think Okay Ramaji Okay Listen I ve got to come over here Okay so like like You two can put your hand down for a minute and I ll go to you next So like steam is I think it s putting pressure like on the balloon to like make it go up So we feel like we have air pressure okay I don t agree with Ramaji though because with the air there s no steam involved there s like kinda like what John said he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it Okay I m gonna ask Oops I didn t let you speak Well like it s just like like comparing this to a regular balloon with helium it would float up just like an air balloon but you can t put helium in an air balloon Does everybody understand that So if I put okay that is an awesome analogy So everybody listen If I put helium helium is a A gas A gas okay helium is a gas so if I take a regular rubber balloon and I put helium in it the helium because it s a gas helium floats that makes my balloon float right Whereas if I just blow up a balloon what happens It just falls down on the ground and I got nothing okay On the flip side Kevin what she s saying is with a hot air balloon instead of filling it with helium I m filling it with hot air okay Now I have a question I think you ve got to think really deep about this one If hot air Reese is what makes my hot air balloon go up okay I want to know would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day Just think about it for a second just think Would it be easier for my hot air balloon do you think to fly on a hot day or a cold day What about on a windy day Ooh Okay she said what about on a windy day Let s assume that there s a slight breeze on either day okay but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold okay Kelsey I personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher So I d get radiation into the balloon Okay Ramaji I think a cold day And why on a cold day Because like there s not I mean even on hot days there s still like low humidity sometimes and so like it you basically with fire would kind of I don t know not set your hair on fire but like No when it s cold there s no moisture in the air so like it would be like like helium but like Okay Shayla I think that it s a hot day One of the reasons is because there s hot in the hot air balloon and if it was on a cold day there s a fire in the thing in the hot air balloon it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground and people could die Okay Ann Maria I think it would be better on a cold day because well I don t know if this actually really makes sense but like the hot air would be working against the cold air Exactly And like if it s on a hot day it would be like the same Just a second So Ann Maria if the cold if the warm air is in the hot air balloon and it s a cold day what would you expect to happen to the balloon Go up And why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day Because like the hot air would be pushing against the cold air faster than it would be pushing against itself Okay Over here I agree with Shayla on the hot day because like a regular air balloon just regular heat would make it go up but if you had the sun hitting against it I think it would help with radiation like the sun would help out The fire Yeah how it has something to do with radiation Okay I think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher Okay Nathan I think on a cold day because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air that might pop it Awesome Kevin what do you think I think the same hot air because I ve never seen a hot air balloon fly when it s cold Okay Dakota Oh wait Kevin I have a question for you How do you define a cold day Okay what s the okay here s my question okay You said you d never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day and what I m asking is is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold Winter Winter okay Dakota what do you think Uh I think uh Kevin Dakota can think on his own I know he can I don t know Cold day warm day what do you think I think a warm day because it would be easier to fly Okay Daniel what do you think Cold day warm day I would say a cold day because the hot air would meet the cold air so it would be more enhanced going up you d get more from the hot air Okay I need to kind of bring this to a close real quick and I know you two have lots to say Tyree did you want to add the last comment Yeah Uh I think the hot day because who would go out on a cold day when the higher you get the colder it gets Okay Tyree says who would go out on a cold day because the higher you get the colder you get so Tyree s logic here is that if I m going to go in a hot air balloon I don t want to get really really cold Okay ladies I know you have lots to add okay but I kind of want to bring this to a close but I need to know a crucial question So everybody has to commit to this question I want you to don t do it until I tell you to Ready You re gonna hold um you re gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day and you re gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day I didn t say go yet Okay on three everybody So does everybody understand This is cold this is warm okay Ready one two three Okay Okay now hands down I have just two more questions and then we re gonna close out today s lesson okay Question number one I want to know if you ve ever heard the word 
 Stationary point Did he move Okay some of the other groups are moving their fingers around sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here so do you think your data might be a little more realistic Yeah Yeah okay so now one thing what type of formation do you guys have Good Put an adjective in front of it Extremely strong Strong A strong positive Do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same No No Okay so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones Remember that correlation coefficient R it went from positive one to negative one or zero Oh yeah What do you think yours would be close to One It d be really close to Then we ll get to that shortly guys later on Okay So you probably would have one that s a decimal 999 or really close Okay so you re trying to find your slope Yeah So what is your slope Two Two okay so over here we re gonna put And now does everyone have the exact same You do Pretty much Oh most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line Okay here s the slope So you just told me your slope is two now what am I asking you to do What is your No we re not done yet What is your It s 2 0 Read the question Okay what s the slope of the equation The slope is What did you just tell me Oh two Two Okay now what s the real world meaning of that What does that mean when you say yes those are two Okay now we can go back to that I just want to talk to you about the solution Just on your slope you said it was two That was perfect But now what s the real world meaning So the slope is the more rubber band What are you looking at So it s one and two One Why can t it So you want to put five Okay Ten over Okay so now you re telling me your slope is ten over one Okay well I m asking you what s your slope Now you re saying your slope is 10 That s what the slope is but I want the real world meaning So what were you saying For every one rubber band that drops How do you know How do you know But where are you getting I need a little more detail though It s dropping what So 10 centimeters for every One One rubber band Okay Now what s your y intercept Seven Seven Now is your y intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location What s the y intercept Because a slope isn t that directions to get somewhere else What s the y intercept I want the entire It s zero seven So can you write zero seven down please Write zero seven down And now tell me what the real When I ask you what the y intercept is yes zero seven Now what s the real world meaning subtract out of seven So what s this saying Translate that for me You re saying there s no real world meaning what s that saying So before we put any rubber bands on this already moves seven centimeters What does that mean Going into this lab did I know if the real world meaning was gonna make sense or not There s been a few groups today their y intercept has a real world meaning zero zero But did I know where your line was gonna go No But if it went straight through zero would that make sense Zero rubber band So So what s the real world meaning Well what do you think This y intercept that you had does it have a real world meaning No So yeah it doesn t have a real world meaning What slope did it Okay Once again did I know that coming in Depended on your data Good job Guys you re asking If you plug into this four times three that s 12 But yeah Three two and four I think it says three Okay So what s your equation Y equals 3x plus 12 Okay so let s talk about that No no it s one intercept the y It really doesn t play out with that algorithm It makes no absolute sense whatsoever Yeah but you find air Oh that makes sense But this What are we talking about We got one anyway but really that s it Wait one second backtrack for one second So what did you say here Five thirds What is a five thirds 5 3 Okay so what s the real world meaning Every five inches there is three rubber band Okay So now does the ball go on a rubber band So flip that around so you re saying two rubber bands the figure is going Yes Okay does that have real world meaning Does that have real world meaning Yeah Yeah Okay Now you re saying what your y intercept is can I see your graph paper for a second Yeah Okay So yeah it looks like it s around Does everybody have the same No Do you think everyone s gonna get the exact same line We didn t really have an intercept slope we just looked at We just Yeah which sounds great because you re all gonna draw that line slightly different so go with one then What does that y intercept Is that directions or is that a location It s a location isn t it So can you write the exact location Because you re only counting one What s the order of pairs here You have a pair of zero one so write that down Pair of zero ones You have a pair of zero ones Yeah What s zero represent Zero rubber bands Zero rubber bands So when zero rubber bands were attached how far did that One One inch Does that make sense to you So when there s zero rubber bands attached you figure out one inch Alright let s demonstrate that Let s see Can I see that for one sec please Okay let s go back to before we started Zero rubber bands attached what s happening Okay what s happening right now Zero rubber bands Did he already move one inch No So Does the y intercept come in No No You said Because you just told me it was five inches of three Yeah What are we discussing now The data or the equation for the Okay Now so does this y intercept make sense No Zero rubber bands are removed So does the y intercept have real world meaning No Does the slope have real world meaning Yeah Did I know your y intercept wasn t gonna have real world meaning Yes No because there s some people today that actually have real world meaning What would be a y intercept if it made sense Zero zero Zero zero Zero rubber bands equals Zero inches Zero inches What were you saying your slope was So let s discuss three The slope is three what s the real world meaning How many rubber bands would you need in your description Grabbing one rubber band does that make sense Okay now so now what anout your y intercept would be at 12 Now you gotta figure Let s discuss this right here Now I think you re thinking ahead But this line looks like it s crossing up here to Where is it crossing It s crossing at We re going up three look three six seven Yeah I was looking like around four So let s discuss this You have six That could be perfect but we know the exact way a line likes to go Let s go with Monique six What s that saying Let s go to a pair to the y intercept Zero pair zero six So what does that mean So write that down zero pair zero six for the y intercept And what s that actually mean Zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches So this was the figure Zero rubber bands attached does that make it already move six inches Does that make any sense at all So does the y intercept have real world meaning Could it still have real world meaning You were thinking ahead I think when you drew your line Because what s the only y intercept that makes sense here Zero rubber bands 81 inches But you didn t move But does that mean you can decide I want to make real world meaning and just draw my line down the zero Because what am I looking for The equation for the line of Is yours the equation for the line now Your y intercept makes sense If you knew the equation for the y intercept You plug in 81 inches for X right Did you end up with a negative You re fine You what Minus what Oh minus one I wanna discuss it If you re y intercept is What s the order of pairs Zero negative one so what s the real world meaning What s that mean What s the zero represent Okay so zero rubber bands what s your y interception At zero rubber bands how far does it go now Negative one Did he already go one or did he reach it So does that make sense Zero rubber bands and he s already traveled one Does that make any sense So does the y intercept Does that mean your y intercept just didn t end up happening Yeah When you know how to use this it works With zero rubber bands how fast are you going Zero Zero Okay does that mean your data s all wrong No that s the way your numbers work Could you slope this out instead three What s that mean Three three what Four is still Five is So three Three what Let s go and do number five Distance so what would your distance be Inches So it s like three inches is over one So that makes sense So does your slope have real world meaning Yeah Okay 
 How you guys doing So 3 Oh what did you do by touching those It made a short circuit It crossed Wow the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple Yeah It s only 3 Why do you think that is 03 Maybe because It s like different rods or something Oranges are more sour than the other fruit Not and like have more acid or something Because it stops the energy We want it a half centimeter apart right Yeah Two centimeters Around So okay go ahead Make sure they aren t touching 0 1 It s not even measuring at all Oh 0 1 0 01 Oh 01 That s crazy I know How this supposed to be one the other two were so high 0 98 I never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy Except for oranges I thought this would have as much as the apple My hypothesis I actually thought that the orange would have the most Go ahead Alright Lizzy you can do the voltage reader Stick them in a half centimeter apart And a centimeter in Okay Lizzy make sure they don t touch Don t short circuit them It s like completely zero The bigger it is the more volts it has The middle one it left like a little here and this was the most I think it s more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else Hmm I wonder why that would be Okay so now we have to get a calculator Okay so 0 22 Plus 0 09 Plus 0 28 I got 0 1966667 So what are you gonna do with that number Round it up Okay 0 20 But wait doesn t someone else need to try it Oh yeah yeah yeah that s a good idea 0 22 plus 0 oh never mind Divided by three I got the same answer So what was the answer to the investigative question What do you think The The apple had the most Do you agree with that Yes Why do you think that is Do you have any guesses It s It s bigger It could carry more volts It has yeah It has like more juice Yeah that s true I think the juice Was your hypothesis correct Actually it was Like right here well Well actually I said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with but I guess apples would work better What was yours I thought the I thought the carrots would produce more because you know usually when you like eat one it s like very wet wet when you just get them so I thought the carrot was going to win but guess not I thought it was the apple I already said that My hypothesis I thought I think the potato would have the most because I heard like I ve heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts So I suspected that they may have been have a lot of voltage also Okay To our investigative question our question was which fruit will produce the most energy And the Kiwi Kiwi and apple had tied for it 0 98 So I don t know maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results I wonder why the orange was so low though Maybe because we since we put it too deep or something No we did the same thing we put all of them Yeah I know Well So then our so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest So how about your hypothesis I thought orange would have it I thought orange would have it I thought orange had it too And had the highest Why Because it had like I thought the apple would because we didn t I thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was How about you Kirsten what did you think I thought the orange because it has more citrus in it I mean yeah I would have thought kiwi would have less because it s so small Yeah me too That s what I thought Then what was our evidence Apple had for an average had 0 98 Orange had 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 06 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 98 So kiwi and apple tied And then our evidence is our data table because that s where we recorded everything Yep So then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation We did them the same length apart and So what are you guys trying to figure out over here We re we re trying to figure out what if the apple carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery What is the food representing in this case A battery Okay Yeah Okay how you gonna figure that out What is your plan We are gonna do gonna try to do a voltage reader and put try to see how much voltage there is in an apple potato or a carrot I think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage well like the apple but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an S battery Series Series let s do series Let s try series It lights up more Yeah it s brighter Okay let s get it done Oh wait we re gonna need more There s a wire in here So I think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter Or at all because it has I think it s gonna have the most it has the most voltage and so it ll make it become brighter Which do you Oh wait we re doing a series battery so Maybe we Where s the other apple It s over there Reece has it Need to wrap it around tight Can I check Jayden do you wanna do it Sure I ll have the honors Keep this one untouched because I m gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to this negative Just the white one Okay there is no wire in this Okay so I think we have enough wires here What do you need the wires for To wrap around to make a series To allow the energy to flow through Okay so what s the purpose of the wires So that the energy will be able to flow What is the energy that s going through the wires Electricity But okay so what is the function of the wires To like be able to pass from one spot to like the battery to the light Okay so you have two different wires Why is that To be able to You know why you have two different wires Um no No I m gonna give you a minute to think about it Okay Is it working No not yet Well I don t think it s working I think I didn t Oh it s going No I don t think I wrapped the wire around right Oh yeah because the This is really short So yeah it was tucking it Let s see that and that and that Yeah that thing s wrapped up tight Well if the volts are enough Don t the apples have to be touching No they don t have to be touching They just have to be the wires just have to go from positive to negative Yeah True But if they don t have enough voltage we should use a potato Yeah we can put the potato to help Yeah we need to put them in every fruit And then connect the wires like that to that that to that So make sure they don t touch Yeah so kinda wrap it around with the wire Yeah try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that Do you what do you guys think do you think that fruit could power our school I don t think so It might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here but You don t think there s enough voltage to supply our whole school No Well like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something I don t know how that would turn out but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top Would you think that would be economical You think that would be beneficial to us in any way Maybe Why It could but we d have to keep changing out the fruit and changing out the fruit It d be lots more work that s for sure Don t let them touch That connects to that and that Do we have another one Because this one is broken Can we borrow one from over here Oh we have one There you go What do you think is gonna happen I think it ll like because we have none of the same touching First we should check the voltage Well I don t we ll just see if it lights the light No don t connect those Why would you wanna check the voltage Just to see if it has enough potential of battery Would make more electricity All the averages I think it should be good this way Because we tested a battery and saw how much it was Connect one to it Then connect yours Lizzy Maybe did we do it wrong No I don t think so Well I think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit Maybe it Try an separate those a little more Kirsten Maybe they re both plus and plus Maybe it s because we re using three types of fruit If we use just two What if we took the prongs out and replace that with this Okay try that Put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it Well don t What are we trying to do here We were trying to make all these the same one Why would you do that Maybe because they need to be the same From the both positive and negative Oh And we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus doesn t matter which way And that and that needs to touch and then that one and that one which is exactly what we did But wait 
 About 33 33 so 150 plus 33 180 What d you get 180 180 so is that Did we double Went a little higher Went a little higher So you guys made a good prediction didn t you All right keep doing your trials nice work Heads up Madison Heads up Ah Can you stop it No you re good All right so what have you guys found out so far We ve been increasing but then we just It increased a little but I think we re gonna increase a little more Okay so you re measuring You ve all you ve raised your ramp to 10 Yes All right All right Now what was your prediction It would go farther based on height Because like from all the other experiments that we ve done Uh huh It s gone farther so And it has more force if the ramp is higher Okay Man that ambulance that thing moves All right what did you guys get Mary Robin when you measured We got 179 179 okay What was weird is that Like what s weird is that on the first trial we got 130 and then we went to like the like 50s and things Okay And then we went back to like the 80s and 90s Yeah All right so now we need to go ahead and do what You ve done your three trials what s the next Average Average All right let s see We got 182 172 and 179 533 533 and then what are you going to do Divide it by three Okay divide by three 177 666667 So we can round that up to To 178 178 Is that pretty close So you got Your trials are pretty close together 182 172 and 179 So you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp Was that true Yes So your prediction came true Let s turn over the back side and let s finish the rest of that lab part So were there any trials that your team did not record We only did it We didn t do that one because it flipped off It like hit this chip card and it just like went whoo It went like All right that s a good one not to include Let s write that down We didn t include one because it hit a chip hard Yeah Yeah that s good It just like flew off to the side and it went all the way like Did it really Yeah it just That s crazy It was funny because It was also funny because it was going straight but then it just That s weird Turned That s weird that it hit that That that caused it to you know make such a turn But then like The whole time it s been going to the the right side Oh okay So it s been curving Yeah it kind of like tilted and That s a good idea Yeah that s a real good idea Okay so question two What was the average distance the Jeep rolled with the five centimeter height So the five centimeter height On the back side of that We got an average of 30 93 93 all right so write that one down 93 Did that surprise you it would go 93 Yeah Yeah Is that farther that s what you thought I never thought we d actually get to the end of it Yeah that s a But then we actually did with those little toy cars Yeah And this is actually an older looking toy car Yeah Because whenever I roll one wheel the other wheel rolls just a little Oh yeah Okay So you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it Yeah Okay But I never thought it would actually go that far Okay So you re now on number three right What was the average distance the Jeep rolled 10 centimeter height That was 178 Okay So 178 It looks like the next question is did the Jeep roll shorter or longer distance Longer Longer Can we figure out how much farther Yes What would we have to do The 10 centimeter average minus the 5 centimeter average and then your answer would be how Like the distance between Well why don t you do that Why don t you pull that up The 178 You know it s always better when you can incorporate those into your answers You know it increased by one Or it was 85 higher It s always better when you can show your answer with data When you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid right All right so maybe can include that and then move on to that number five there Okay All right You guys are doing a great job Hey have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side Did you read all these first You gotta read this whole section of your lab first okay Yeah so I would read this part first and then move on okay All right All right how you guys doing Good All right so you guys have done your first trial on this one Now did you do this one here I don t Let s look at our directions It says change the ramp back to five centimeters high Did you do that No sir Okay let s do that All right Sandpaper And then I think it Doesn t it say It says tile floor It says tile floor so we re going to measure on the tile I get to race it All right are we ready Now I m going to move over here Now what vehicle we got here You should move over there because it always goes over here Oh it always moves over here Yeah It has a curve Yeah How about if I move back over here Will that work All right you ready Right here Yeah that s good Oh you re right Good thing I moved I ll hold it down Hold that down Now in your first experiment Annie while they re doing this what did it When you increased the height of the ramp did it increase Yeah it went faster It went what It went faster because it had more force Okay so it had more force So why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab it had more force All right It s more steeper Okay And the more steeper it is the more less friction it would cause so it could go faster Okay What was the force that was bringing it down the ramp Gravity Gravity So you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp the pull of gravity is greater Yeah because it s going more Okay all right It s going down going faster Okay And then when it gets if it gets down safely it ll just go farther because it has more speed Okay Great All right so we re on trial two aren t we Yes Let s do it Go You do have that it does have that curved roll Oh it landed on the On the back of it There s like a cargo of some sort in the back of it Is it is there a There s cargo in the 113 Wait wait hold on Let s double check What I would do maybe is bring your Jeep over Yeah but then it s 106 No but then it s Oh you re on the Are you going to the front Yeah Okay 113 yeah you re right No but then you re going at an angle And you don t let it go Yeah I mean either way I think you re going to get a As long as you That s the way we re doing it from here Well you know as long as you do the same thing every time then you should be consistent right Yeah All right one more roll right One more And then we have it yeah One more roll Jordan Here we go Then we have to add them all up Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun Dun dun dun dun dun The only thing is that Is that farther Don t you think it s farther Are we ready Maybe it s because of me Do you think you have anything to do with it Yeah You do huh Go Fire 117 How far 117 117 all right 117 So now wait Now Thiago the math whiz has to do his math All right so how do you find the average again We do We do We add them all up and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it Okay let s do it So we rolled it three times You ready Let s find our average Pencil please Oh you guys aren t even using a calculator No we haven t been We only use it for the division Oh you only use it for the division Hey I like that Sometimes sometimes Sometimes we still need it What do you guys got 10 That s zero 10 To zero add up the Four and three So 340 So you re going to take 340 and then you re going to divide it Divided by three And Thiago can usually do that You get 113 3333333 All right well check it out on a calculator just to make sure Okay How can you do that in your head without a calculator I don t know Yeah but how do you do that What did you say the number was Thiago It was 113 33333 All right here we go It s 113 come on Thiago 113 333333333 He got it All right nice job man All right so 113 Is that pretty consistent though Yeah Yeah because we had a 113 Yeah you did And that was your middle score wasn t it Yeah And really if you take the thing And then we gotta do this one No never mind I think if you take four here and you put it here Yeah if you take three here put it here then you have one more here Yep All right So now what we re going to do it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp Which we did And predict whether it s going to go We ll have to redo those won t we Yeah So let s erase those because you had the ramp at how high 10 centimeters 10 and we needed to We need to have an equal trial We need to have it at the same distance right Yeah So the question is Sit up for me Jordan I know we got a lot of space here What are we going to Do you think it s gonna go shorter or a farther distance It s gonna go shorter Why Because there s more friction Sandpaper s rough so it creates more friction Okay Slow down the thing Okay what do you think When it slows it down it may slow it down and then it says the car starts to turn just because Just because it s our car goes out to the side so it goes more to the side All right Than it usually does What do you guys think Farther or shorter I think it ll go shorter because The gravity may be pulling it down but the sandpaper is really rough like Thiago said and it would like stop it to make it not move anymore It would like barely get off the paper Okay can you guys like Say you re riding your bike And you ride your bike on smooth pavement and then you ride it on a rough surface Is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough Smooth The smooth right So can we use that to help us make our prediction It actually could be faster on the bumps more because if you hit a bump If you re going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump you could actually go in the air Okay maybe All right let s go and test this thing out and see if you guys are right Annie while we re setting up this lab can you go ahead and write your prediction And it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there Now I can t sit here can I This is the bad seat I gotta move Well I say you sit It doesn t go very far anymore on the sandpaper All right well let s set it up there That one there right And that one there Four centimeters more All right let s look We went 113 With the sandpaper how far do you think it s gonna go Let s make a prediction I think it ll go maybe half that or even less than half that Okay so what would half of 113 be What s that close to I don t know I think that would be maybe 500 500 and No you want half of it Oh five okay Half of it 50 I think there you go 50 yeah 50 All right 52 51 point 50 point like Okay All right are we ready for the first roll Let s do it Let s get our first trial Here we go We re ready Wait who hasn t rolled Has Emma not rolled Okay all right good I like the way your group s working together there All right Here we go Oh Should we use that trial or should we try a different one Try again Let s try one more Maybe we can get that Well scoot it right over here And we could even scoot the sandpaper like there Yeah All right you ready All right there it is It didn t even move off the sandpaper Let s give it Can someone hold that down Can someone hold that down please Here we go This is our test Is the prediction right The sandpaper s hard It is it s rough isn t it Yeah 49 Now aren t you on the front Yeah which would be a 49 Yeah but you mean Or maybe you re about 50 Yeah about 50 You guys were pretty close in your prediction weren t you Half It was like 50 Yeah Jordan said 50 1 2 All right you guys got two more trials right I said 51 1 2 You said 51 1 2 All right ready Yeah Oh man Really Let s like keep it down Or maybe we ll hold it down next time yeah Yeah I think that s the problem It s scooting back That was 50 47 Yeah 47 Okay Almost in half All right I ll hold it on this side Are we ready Here we go 
 You re not doing your job Follow the arrow Good Just a little bit Why Why do we say the wiffle Because it Because nothing in it It s holes Then is it the holes and nothing in it makes it heavy or light Light Light Good Next what do we have to do We have all our arrows down Good Exactly Okay Thank you Someone needs to hold this here I have a job for you Come hold the clip Hold this here Hold this here Come around here Come here sweetie Right here Hold this Okay now let s count Go to there and I ll help Okay Good Good boy Oh no Uh oh Put it in the basket Put it in the basket Good You have to help her count I need to hear you Should I could count 30 No No It s not far When this is 20 21 Good Is that more than the wiffle ball This one More than this Is this one more Sebastian Yes Good Good 52 Write your 52 down What s the problem What What have you done here Okay I see working on her turn She hasn t done anything Because we re not helping What Which one did you roll You don t need this You re not to this point yet First you re doing the rolling Okay You need to move to the side Now help her Okay Good Wait wait wait Oh okay Good Now it s turn Okay now You help her by holding the end No it s fine I can tell what it is You re doing a good job Someone needs to hold this end right here Hold the end right here Okay now Perfect Now we have to help her count So she can write her numbers down Okay start with the first one the wiffle ball How far is the wiffle ball Starting 10 here Is this 10 Where s the 10 Good You think that s how far it is Okay so write that down Put in wiffle ball I said I m next I said I m next I m looking now at asked about yours I think you have your numbers in the wrong spot Which went further Wiffle ball Which one Which one went far The baseball okay Because I think on our list you have them written backwards We ll fix them We ll find them with the right picture Okay let s see what the problem is The one s got to go on this side Please help her count where the baseball is Count with her 14 Is there a faster way we could ve done that By doing what By doing what Exactly by counting by 10s We could ve started here and gone 20 20 and then count from there You re right Good So who s next Steven Now what s going on here Sarah was saying something What s happening No remember you did this Together count them 20 Well let s look It does look like 3 Yes Good Write it on the board But you two can start And then you two can start You hold the Good Mark it Good Where does the ball go Put it in the basket Excellent Help the boys now You can hold the ramp It looks like it s about to fall Too late Wait wait All the things to say Now with the rubber ball Exactly This one s called the what Wiff Wiffle ball Wiffle ball What happened with the balls Hold it Let me look at yours You got yours done What happened with yours What happened with the baseball It went Which one went the farthest This one How about yours Which one of yours went the farthest Yeah the baseball Remember we talked about that The ball should be in the basket so it doesn t go under the chair counting What happened No but what happened here Someone has to hold it you re right Can you hold it Good That s better 30 This is 50 50 start again each one 51 Pablo Which one of the balls went furthest The baseball What did we talk about when we said at the beginning Which ball did we think was going to go the farthest The baseball Why did you think it was going to go furthest Because right Yes How about yours And Sarah s too Did the baseball go the farthest That far That was a hard push exactly That was a soft and that was a soft Which one was the softest Two Which one was a really soft push The wiffle ball Why Why did we say that Because the ball Just a little bit What happened when you weighed the ball When you put them in the balance The baseball get s heavier The baseball was heavier Baseball needed nine magnet weights you re right You remember It was heavy Good you re absolutely right Okay help him count to his wiffle ball Hold the end 
 Brooke what did you choose The cylinder Why Okay five and what about you Ms Leah Cylinder Why Because it has two faces It has two faces and what about you Ms Cecilia The sphere and why you need to write your words down Okay so write your words down so you guys can hand in your sheet Who thinks wants to cut Who think will cut Here what about Samantha then you Okay and then me then Brian Okay but he goes you too You called You want to hold and stretch Well that s the one you re doing and you ll be cutting Okay so Katie cuts then Samantha then me and then Brian He is going to roll the shapes down the hill I ll stretch and you can hold okay Samantha Wait guys this is Guys it s the sphere Spheres Those are spheres That s the cylinders No This is the sphere color you already got Here how about I ll be Who wants cylinder raise your hand Who wants sphere Who wants cylinder So it s three versus one So do the cylinder first and then use Fine I ll get on it You guys working it out Alright Yes Blake what do you need We need more string You need more string Okay alright Keep that one right there and roll one of your other shapes and I ll get you a longer piece of string Okay Hold on I got it right here I ll tie it on there how s that Okay is that going to work for you Alright Isaac go ahead and stretch it out How long it was We need to hang that up You can cut this tie Okay I ll cut this time I ll have Don t roll it now I can measure it I ll cut it Now Leila roll it down Move the cylinder Blue blue oh we have only blue When you guys are measuring who s doing the holding You are Okay Foster hold it Who s doing the stretching Because you re going to have to stretch it out you can t cut it until it s stretched You re stretching and so Sierra s cutting Okay Foster you hold it you gotta stretch it all the way out Yeah okay cut it right here Like that Here there you go Open it a little bit more There you go okay And Foster go put it up on the graph and Sierra you can throw away the extra Okay good job What shape is this Hunter Sphere Sphere alright and what do you know what s special about the sphere It rolls and what s really special about it It has no faces It has no faces you re brilliant Okay the next one Whoa You can cut it You may be able to I want to straighten it Measure it The sphere went the farthest So was your prediction right Jackson Was your prediction right Yes No No So you want to circle no and you want to circle yes Anthony was your prediction right Okay so you want to circle the check mark for yes your prediction was right And then you guys can get some crayons and draw your observations and what you saw in your experiment I think The cylinder Okay who s letting this go Me Okay you can t measure it till she lets it go Ready go Cecilia let her go Look at the poor little cube Why do you think it doesn t go very far Because it has sides What kind of sides Squares And they re what Flat Flat alright but now you ve picked it up and you can t measure it Alright who s doing the holding Okay now hold on a second Leah so when you measure you want to turn it this way so the edge is right up against the ramp and then you hold it tight and then you can cut it right here okay Alright so who s holding you are Okay alright You hold this you hold that Okay can I go hang that up Now we do some Okay hold on can you hold this away for a second while she sends it down Ready Okay ready Alright now are you the holder Okay Use the stretcher Try and stretch the So Katie you took Brian s turn last time honey so it s his turn Okay girls what shape is this one Rectangular prism And what s special about it Because Because Because it has Because it has rectangle Rectangle what Faces Faces and they are Flat Flat rectangles right so did it go very far No Did anybody pick the rectangular prism to go the farthest You picked that one Okay so now you know it didn t go too far Alright so now you re going to try your Cube Cube okay good Who s cutting now Who Who s sliding it Samantha No I didn t slide it down before Samantha didn t So were you right Leila Yeah you did Yes or yes ma am Yes ma am Alright so you can circle your prediction was correct and then was your prediction correct Isaac No you guys said the cylinder went the farthest Was your prediction correct Okay so you circle here your prediction wasn t correct and then was your prediction correct Aspen No and what about you Blake yes Okay so now you guys can go ahead and clean up all of your stuff and then you can get one of the crayon caddies and draw a picture of what happened Blake I want you to help your team clean up before you start drawing your observations Good job team Hey that s mine That s my pencil Wait I m not ready yet I m not ready yet I got it right I got it right Yeah I got it right I got it right So which shape do you guys have left What is that Cone The cone and what s special about the cone And so what happens to it It slides It does slide on its face What else is special about the cone Cecilia It rolls in a circle Why Because You okay Because it has a flat face Mm hmm and what else makes it roll in that circle Leah It has a point It has the point on it so this is your last one to measure Yes Okay yes or yes ma am Yes ma am Alright good luck You throw that away I ll throw it away So was your prediction correct Hunter Yes Yes so the cylinder went the farthest for you guys Okay so Sierra if the cylinder went the farthest your prediction wasn t right so now you re gonna circle the X Does it matter that you are right No No you re just predicting and that means you re guessing you don t have to be right Circle the X and then go ahead and draw your pictures It s orange So you guys are gonna show the cylinder going the farthest Just do it Do it here Now I don t know what s going the farthest It was probably cylinder Yeah Okay so what shape went the farthest for you guys Um the cylinder The cylinder so was your prediction correct Was yours Was yours Mm no What shape did you predict Um the sphere Sphere but the cylinder went the farthest so were you right No so did you circle the little X on the bottom And then you can do your picture Was your prediction correct Brian Okay so circle the check mark and draw your picture and then you guys can copy the graph from the board on the back so you can show your parents what happened Good work team All right so this team s all set Okay so which one went the furthest for this team The sphere The sphere okay so was your prediction right Cecilia Yeah Okay was yours right Brooke So does it matter if you got it right Not at all Alright so then draw your observations draw what happened and then you can draw the graph on the back Now we have to draw the graph on the back 
 What were you saying Joe I said young people definitely benefit our society overall more than old people in the country Why Just because they can Progress Contribute more Yeah Like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people Yeah they re a lot more active compared to old people more who just is gonna basically sit at home I mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling the rebellion is completely composed of the youth Yeah If we look at the political situation in America like Obama s election was pretty much the 18 to 21 year old vote It s just like clearly they re like better at affecting social change In this time period that we re discussing why would you want the youth to come Well because this is like the start of all social change in the union and I want young people to bring a youthful energy and determination and some sort of hope about the country that they re moving to and that all my union in here They re gonna progress they re gonna like technology and they re gonna invent stuff So you re onboard with the I m just saying we still need more money They re going to be working and they re going to be taking money out of our economy because they re gonna want to pledge How much are they gonna spend Like we need old people to spend a lot like rich people to spend But we need workers Yeah no so it s like We need workers old people cannot work We need a combination If only get young people If we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with the old people on this list aren t that rich Yeah but there s The bottom line is Gonna be more than just the old people there the old people other countries But right now we re focusing on that they re going to be moving and they re rich who would move here Why would they move to the Land of Opportunity if they don t need opportunities I didn t mean to say that That s honesty Okay Yeah but I mean I see that It seems like the majority did the majority rule on that Because I guess who was against having younger people come in I know Matt was Was Matt the only one who wanted older people to come in Ok and you were Also I m a loner You just went with the consensus Yeah Okay good Another point another point Also old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life aren t necessarily going to be all that interested in America Okay as a country And wait and also They re not going to vote they re not going to you know try to participate in the country itself so they re just here to die in comfort Okay go ahead Darvel On the way it s already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the United States because so many people died on the way getting there so they might die on the way getting there So don t even consider them to begin with Right Or if they re sick they can t come into the country anyway Like we re not going to let people who have cholera into our country because then it ll start spreading here so You said colema or column Isn t that more in Cholera That s like Okay I was like what What else did you guys have on your cards What about religion Does religion matter No I don t think it did No no That s one thing we I think we all could agree on Yeah Oh everybody What about the nativists What about the nativists Darvel you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group Well I mean it s kind of like on the edge of the He s conformed But I because most of the time it s Christianity in the United States so Also majority rule Yeah majority rules USA USA Okay so who did you guys decide to wait was that the end of your criteria or No we had There s still reasons for coming race and knowledge of English previous jobs and Oh what d you guys say for English What d you guys say They have to know English Yeah we said they had to know Basic English at least At least a little bit They have to know some of it Or Enough to you know find out where the bathroom is Really Or enough to like communicate Or have the ability to learn it With other people who may not know English that well And Boss you were okay I mean I feel like I m one of the only ones who disagreed with that because like being a boss like I have connections like in every part of my city and every community and communities are often like separated by race so By race and And language Mm hmm So maybe different communities wouldn t have trouble communicating if they only knew one language Mm hmm But being a boss with my connections I could definitely like I could make it so that they could communicate and I can get them what they need help them out Okay I don t think now English is a necessity Well you wouldn t I think it s pretty I mean how are people supposed to communicate And it s just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it Because I mean overall the majority speaks English But we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages so they could just They re getting by though Right right I don t know if You should know them working in factories you should know a lot of these people Yeah but You might even know someone When I think of like different languages I think of like the Tower of Bavel or Babel it s like in the Bible story where like everybody spoke different languages and then the tower collapsed So like if everybody speaks different languages we can t get work done productively because we don t know what each other want Like if we say Yo go make this type I don t know just Do this job and then they do something else you need communication Darvel what do you think about the language piece Well I think that speaking English is basically it s a necessity I mean obviously you would want workers to come in because he just wants money He doesn t really think communication is that important but as a nativist I believe that it is Why What will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages maybe be different races different ethnicities What will happen to the country if we let those people in I mean that could create like conflict between the work because like Matt said they really wouldn t know what to do while they re working Also that could change the patriotism of the country as well But will they know why they re working Not really So people who don t speak English don t know why they re doing a specific job Well probably yeah I mean they know that they re doing a job to get money Right so does English really matter I m just asking I mean they re not gonna really X you wouldn t care if they spoke English because if they didn t speak English it might make it easier to exploit them I somewhat care Because they have to collaborate with the people they re working with to get the job done The way I see it is they can come into the country with a you know as long as they have the mindset of I should probably learn English to succeed in this country then I think it s a good idea Because if you re going to be immersed in a language you re going to be able to learn it eventually so I mean as long as they try to learn English or try to know basic English I think they should I mean I think I agree to Darvel Like if I was a nativist I m not saying I am but if I was a nativist I wouldn t want hoards of people who don t speak English coming because I mean it s like America s pure we ve got everybody speaks English like we don t want But does everybody really speak English right now Not now I m saying No not right now in 2011 but in our age that we re discussing If I was a nativist in my Even then right In my like Ideal world you would want everybody to like speak English Okay The whole world should speak English Oh goodness Yeah that s what a nativist would say I went with the English speakers because like to properly rebel and have a voice communication is vital and I think that people who aren t speaking English won t be interested in what I have to say can t even understand what I m saying so Okay well you guys decide and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically okay Yeah All right thanks guys Oh we already did Education s not really that important to me though I think it s really important Dude it s saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren t educated to begin with Well education like You would want educated people As a non union worker like I don t care about education I just want to keep my job and I want like union workers to get out of the country And as a union worker I want educated immigrants because then they would stand up for themselves and like change factory conditions Me being a tycoon I just want people to work for me I mean they can come to this country they can live the American way I ll supply them with a job What s the American way American way is to Well but you re not giving them any money Wait wait wait what s the American way 2 5 kids We are actually 2 5 kids white picket fence Dog Well that s the American is that the American way now or then We re talking about then Labrador Basically the American way is I want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in Okay That s my concern Well but they came here to like succeed and you re giving them like two cents an hour I mean for me with education though it s not that big of a deal because then again if they re coming to America they re going to have to learn our customs and our way and with them being uneducated that s easier for us to mold them into society and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for and stuff like that But this is supposed to be like a free country and they came over here because we like grant that and we re just like manipulating them Yeah but like basically the only people I want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs Like people who are kind of like Who are those people Kind of like sketchy people kind of because like You want sketchy people to come into your country Well sketchy people are about to give me jobs because like sketchy people are about to like What do you mean by sketchy What does sketchy mean When you re saying sketchy do you mean poor or like Nah I mean like people that are like rich and stuff and they ll like have a business and whatever but like They re corrupt a little Yeah they re a little corrupt so they won t like hire union workers and they ll keep their people ununionized so I can come in and take the work make that cash Know what I m saying Oh okay So you want it that people will have money when they come into the country but not be on the side of unions Exactly So that they will They ll give me jobs They will okay they ll hire non union workers They re not people that are going to be entering the workforce they re people that are going to be like already kind of upper you know what I mean Okay so you want people with money coming into the country Yeah exactly Okay Did you guys decide on a criteria already Yup Or are you discussing a criteria We have a criteria This is our criteria pretty much Okay what s your criteria We said non educated which some of us don t agree with Who didn t agree with it I don t agree with that Why Because I did not agree with it America is the land of education Everybody needs an education You can t come here Well but at this time remember education is not like going to school It s more of knowing a skill or a trade It s like street smarts almost Well if they don t know anything then they can work Yeah Okay And we decided on that Do people really need to know a lot though to work in these factories No but like No my business is to teach them how to use these machines We don t want them to be taken advantage of I mean but at the same time I don t really see the importance of education if they don t come with like money or some type of like I don t know some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in America Because you may know you know how to read 100 books but that doesn t help you like start a business or something like that Yeah Yeah but not like that kind of education Like education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay Like so they can stand up for themselves and like be able to like negotiate with you Why is that not okay I mean everyone has to get paid Everyone gets paid that same amount Yeah but they re living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions I mean that s in your opinion A house is a house Yeah and then look at where they re coming from They re coming from religious persecution they re coming from these governments that are collapsing these war stricken countries Exactly and the government I think it s better to work in a factory earn some wage Yeah but how much are you earning compared to them Eat or have necessities in life I mean but there s also government support too That s where I come in I set them up with a place to stay stuff like that you know That s what government s here for is support of people that come in here So it s best when they re not educated it s best when they don t have money because that makes it easier for them to get help and that s what we re here to do is to help people But then they re relying on you and they don t know what to do with themselves like when you They re relying on him but then he lets them rely on themselves so they come in rely on him and then he kind of sends them like How Helps them out How does he keep people from relying on him Because then all right so I can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives Like if there s a politician voting for labor laws I can help them If I m with that politician I can Yo this is the guy you want to vote for This is the guy that will help you That s like brainwashing though they like have a right to think for themselves Honey this is America Exactly Exactly Exactly So you re saying that nobody should campaign ever You re saying campaigning is brainwashing No you could campaign but you don t Exactly he s just campaigning Can I just say something No but he s like getting them all to agree with him Okay if you think about it this way you can really have people from all spectrums of money wise like from all kinds of economic backgrounds You can have the more rich people come in sorry the education backgrounds The more educated people are going to come in No matter what they re going to help our country more than hurt it Then for me I can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education and I can give them a job I can start them off in life and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves Why don t you better their working conditions then if you like are helping them Because I mean still this is much better No because they like die in those factories It s better than being killed by their previous governments Wait have we decided No it s not It s not the same thing Have you guys already decided on this piece already Yeah we have like our set laws we just have disagreements about that You guys have disagreements So you guys were able to a consensus on them Yeah well we kind of voted on it We decided that they have to be non educated come with some sort of money Their religion and race doesn t matter Come with a family 
 Think out loud what are we doing OK you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to How do we do that Take 196 divide it by four Hold on let me hear from somebody that I haven t heard from Need to find the square root of 196 OK why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four Because all sides are equal Well if all sides were equal that s why we would divide by four Because to find the area of the square you have to square it So the opposite of squaring is square root So we would divide by four if we were given the perimeter If we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four But we were given the area so we need to square root 14 OK so the side lengths are 14 Multiply times 4 It s 56 Anybody see a problem with this OK so this side is on the inside of the figure So it doesn t count so instead of doing 14 times 4 We do 14 times 3 How do we find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi R divided by 2 2 pi R divided by 2 How do you find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi R divided by 2 So the radius that means 7 7 is 14 2 times pi times 7 So that should be 2 times 3 14 So the whole thing is 53 38 So then 2 pi R divided by 2 I got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14 So 14 divided by 2 is 7 Here Skye can you take this Thank you Put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem C squared OK all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal How many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure Don t you got to work it into two rectangles I think it d be easier of you did it the long way Does it matter which way you split it Either way you re going to have to split something right You can determine either of the missing sides In order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply 7 times 6 is 42 Where is I don t see a 7 in my problem OK but what does 7 represent I don t see a 7 what is It represents the length of this What length From the line on down to 6 OK Could you label that with a 7 Cause I still don t see 7 It said how many one inch squares OK so you want to multiply what by 12 87 87 times 12 Why But you made the 12 into a 7 OK so you want to do Where are you all getting 12 from A foot is 12 inches There s one inch not twelve Oh because I found the 87 feet squared I found the area of it but then you ve got to find how many 1 inch so you multiply it times 12 because there s 12 inches in a foot So what are we multiplying with 12 So we re doing 87 times 12 Shouldn t you divide though Try dividing What do you get when you divide Say that again In one square foot there are 144 inches Instead of going by 12 which I said originally shouldn t we be doing it by 144 Since one square foot is how many inches it is But I ve got 87 square foot But I m saying in each foot there s 144 inches So instead of 12 there are 144 square inches So instead of multiplying by now that I think about it we should multiply it by 144 OK let me ask you guys this what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area Could we do it that way Yeah OK let s try it that way What would 9 be in inches 9 feet in inches 108 108 What would 5 be in inches 7 in inches 7 feet 84 84 thank you Kashmir And 6 72 72 thank you Sierra OK we know what all our units are in inches Now when we find the area we re going to be finding square inches Somebody want to take over from here Skye do you mind if you continue writing Uhm yeah No I don t mind Thank you You can erase all of it My eraser got stolen So do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width right Yeah It s what 6 480 It s multiplying But that s wrong though Don t you still have to subtract I mean like 84 minus 60 because they re part of the No we didn t convert the 12 We converted the 7 Oh OK So it s still already changed Good question though What s the total 12 528 I just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct You are supposed to multiply by 144 Good job What did you say it was 12 528 How d you get that OK Next problem No You have a question Yes When you get 1000 When did you have 1 044 Oh and then you multiply by 12 again Because guess what 12 times 12 is 144 So that s what you re doing You re multiplying by into 12 and 12 right They way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15 From the very very top to the very bottom Thank you because now we know that that s 1 inch Can t you break it up Now that we know the basic triangle in the back That means you re breaking it up into a triangle and a square Yes The square on the bottom I m sorry Jacob The base of what The base of the triangle in the back But what s the base 5 The height is 5 and the base is 15 Well yeah but I was asking Jacob what the base of the triangle was Can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18 Because the width of the rectangle is 10 and I have to add the sides of the triangle 
 Okay What objects or pictures do you see I see a flag A flag A sign The sun And the letters A sign Yeah And the birds There are birds over here People carrying bags Okay people carrying bags There s a ship A ship The ladies all have hats Okay The ladies all have hats on They look like they re dressed to go somewhere right Yeah Good All right Do you want us to write it in here You can copy it I have the words spelled up here We have Uncle Sam We have a boat Do you want us to write it I m going to have it up here Yeah Oh We have a flag We have this thing What does this thing look like Kind of like a witch No No Yeah It looks kind of like a witch Something scary anyway right Yeah Broccoli It looks like broccoli Okay Yeah it does It s kind of fluffy on top I agree All right There are people We ve got people We ve got birds Mm hmm So here are our objects Uncle Sam boat American flag I wrote scary devil looking thing If you want to put witch looking thing that s fine I m gonna put both Traveling people and birds I put enough blanks for a few objects but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote All right Okay Which of the objects whoops Okay Which of the objects do you see could be symbols The flag All right This is what I want you to do Stop Turn to the person beside you Beside you beside you beside you See if you can think of you already said flag That s a perfect example It is one of them I think four of these are symbols Not every object is going to be a symbol So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more Each pair can be that Two different Yeah Oh All right What did we come up with We came up with the top of his hat thing It s the same as the flag It looks exactly like the flag okay So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of U S Of the United States Good Did you come up with one The traveling people The traveling people What do you think they symbolize They re from other countries Yeah They symbolize people from other countries Good Did you come up with one The scary devil looking thing Okay What is that It s clouds in the sky Okay It looks like clouds but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary looking thing To get them out To scare them Or maybe it s the rain They re scared of storms Okay Who is the devil looking thing Who is he going after The people The people What are the people running away from From their other countries From their other countries So what could the cloud be a symbol of Bad things Immigrants Yeah They re the immigrants What is the cloud Yeah Their governments from their own countries Oh Is coming back after them or trying to scare them anyway All right Here we go We have these four Uncle Sam the boat the American flag and the devil looking thing I didn t do one for the travelers but you re right They can symbolize immigrants Uncle Sam symbolizes America This is one you didn t say I told you The ark this boat here symbolizes what The Bible The ark from the bible Okay Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible Yeah What did the ark do It saved It saved Noah his family and who else Animals And the animals Oh yeah Now I remember So what do you think this boat s purpose in this picture is What s the boat going to do Save them Save Okay So knowing that knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America what do you think Are these people being stopped or welcomed Welcomed Welcomed And how do we know that He s letting them in He s like come on let s go But how do we know that he s welcoming them and not telling them to stop Because it s the ark Because it says ark okay And we re connecting what we know about the ark to this picture That is called an allusion In English class you talked about allusion Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous Some famous piece of literature Okay The flag stands for freedom The scary devil looking thing is governments from other countries Take a second and copy that down Okay I ll go on to the next question How are the words How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean Okay We talked about this already The U S Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States Okay Identify the cartoon s caption All right In this cartoon there is no caption There is no title at the top or at the bottom but there are some words that help us understand and that s this sign The sign says no oppressive taxes no expensive kings no compulsory military service So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants To the traveling people Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon Okay What words or phrases here can be used to identify I was going to say the ark Yeah The Ark of Refuge And what does it identify The ark It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon What is the ark The boat But what is it a symbol of Welcoming Yeah A symbol of welcoming people right Or a symbol of America itself because once you re in you re in America What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant All right Calling the U S a refuge tells us people come here for safety We ll come back to it And here the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings Tell us why people left their countries To get good jobs Yeah To get jobs To have a better life Right What were they running away from From paying taxes From paying taxes From kings Now any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings 1900s 19th Century The 19th Century which would be the periods were very big Kings were a problem in some places in the world No oppressing taxes Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s people were dealing with this okay So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out All right List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean What adjectives are in the cartoon It s on this sign for one thing Oh The kings Okay What did they call the kings Wealthy What did they call kings What kind of kings did they have It s kind of hard to read there Okay Here we go We ll do it this way Controlling Yeah More powerful than others Expensive can t see I know I know So oppressive means it s controlling Expensive means they spend too much money Yeah Compulsory means that you have to do something Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army The army s a fantastic place but not everybody wants to be there You do understand right Yes Okay Anybody not want to be in the army I want to serve my country Yeah Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it No I want to have a choice You want to have a choice I want my army to have chosen to be there Right Because I don t want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there okay Okay Describe the action in the cartoon Action I can t cover those I forgot to put the space bar Okay so what s happening in the cartoon We ve already said this Everybody s coming to Uncle Sam And what s happening The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam Right All right What is the message of the cartoon It s that we have to welcome the immigrants Correct The message of the cartoon is that the U S is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don t like What special interest groups now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon Stop and take a second Turn to your partner See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon Talk to you partner What is it Okay A special interest group Go ahead keep talking A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them okay So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree 
 In my classroom each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers where they also may store their art and they ve each made a back splash of art inspirational images In the corner of the room I have a resource area including images of art books and magazines a computer with an internet connection and examples I have a board where I give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance I have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations In the corner of the room there s acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron In front of that there s soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above and also eye protection and gloves The sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps In the corner of the room you see a fire extinguisher a buffing machine a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow and ear protection a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves an emergency eyewash station and shower and first aid kit In here we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation And in the front we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher This is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry Now this isn t jewelry per se You know what these are Coins Coins There s such an interesting iconography of coins I love the patterning that happened when he cast them I mean I just think its You ve got the horse You ve got the man Some sort of a symbol I don t really know what all the symbols are but you could really use a lot of this And do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up And here people have even made jewelry out of the coins And here art is an example of in north Africa a lot of times women traditional women it s probably changing now but I don t really know how much it s changed or not changed This picture is from 1988 or something so it s in the past But they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry And they d wear it everyday And it might seem ridiculous to us you can do your farming you re going about your business cooking and you re wearing all that craziness but that way it s on them they have it if something happens to their husband nobody can take it away because it s on their body It s protected It s also very obvious If the husband were to steal the money and take it away they would know because she s not wearing it So he would be shamed So it s sort of it s like the dowry the money comes into the family from the woman s parents but it s also to help protect the woman It s not just it s not just to go to the husband So I think it s amusing that they re wearing it I thought they weren t allowed to wear makeup Well it depends in what part of where you are I mean are you thinking who is they I m thinking Iran and stuff and north Africa Right Iran there s different sects of Islam and what people believe as really strict is different In this north Africa Iran s more in the Middle East getting closer I mean does it even even in Asia it might even be Asia No it s not in north Africa It s not in Africa So this is like north Africa there s a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert It s all intermixed And people in southern Africa like in Sudan are predominantly Islamic and they have a different take on it too So maybe in Iran it s frowned upon as vanity but The Muslim culture requires women to cover their faces It s not Muslim religions that only It s Arabian That s very good Chloe Very very astute It s there traditions It s not required by the religion it s a cultural thing That s good That s a good clarification I didn t think of it that way So also this redeemable investment or wealth people like to and they have people over for dinner Golden silverware On the right that was the silverware of Marie Antoinette I ve never heard of gold silverware So gold I know they re eating on gold And it can t be 24 carat because it would be too soft But it s probably a gold alloy And there s also cases of people when times get tough melting down their silverware So they can have the Yeah and you use that as your it s like people nowadays are investing in gold They re buying gold bars because it s like you own something You see it It s not just a piece of paper that says you own something Yeah I think there s commercials about buying gold And this is a chalice through the church The church accumulated a lot of wealth specifically the Catholic church during the Medieval times And they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood Okay attraction and beauty This is pretty obvious because where do people usually wear jewelry On their necks and faces and Yeah yeah to draw attention I think to the face usually is a big deal And also this is an example of a Cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman So a lot of times it s with the idea of love or commitment romantic love Here we have Indians from India and these are things that you can buy This is just off of that So this is like the traditional wedding where you ve got kind of an inexpensive version perhaps that you can buy There s all sorts there s all levels of expense that you can buy And here we are again with north Africa Just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn t beautiful I don t know How many of you have tattoos Any of you have a tattoo I wish Okay I mean you re a little bit young Right Do you think you might want a tattoo at some point Yeah my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back Really Do you like it Yeah it s really pretty but I wouldn t want something like that Yeah I don t remember what it says Something it has to do with swimming I think It s like swimming In some way It s a really good quote though Yeah she looks like that girl from Avatar You know I haven t seen Avatar but as a movie designer James Cameron what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie Probably If you I mean does anybody like Star Wars That was a popular kind of thing But you know I always wanted the hair braids Mom mom please She s like Your hair isn t long enough That was a movie They had it was a wig I was like Do it Do it I braid my hair put beads in it sometimes There are cultures that wear their hair like that So it s like nothing is sort of new under the sun People are reinventing what s already happened I always wanted it just like Pocahontas that s the entire story The second time I saw it I was like Oh this is really bad One thing they represented it wrong that s like the reason they were there because it was very valuable Oh so you re thinking it could have been a little more creative You know the first time you see it it s so good And then the second time you re like Hey now that I ve seen this So it s good to critique pop culture to determine If you get a job in the movies how would you do it better or differently I d do a different plot I d be more creative Okay yeah we better I m gonna keep moving on All right Okay so here we have ancient Egypt on the left and we have Miss South Carolina 2000 I can t remember 2004 2006 recently Isn t it interesting how similar the eye the eyeliner the long eyebrow the hair coming down the crown You know I mean I think the eyebrows Well she doesn t have the I m trying to create a bead kind of thing Okay Melting the stuff Drew was using for his corset together Oh the screen So you re melting the screen Oh interesting So how will you use that in your I m thinking I can use it in attaching because I think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that not gold and shell ish Okay Okay well do you want to go look at your stuff Or do you want to or you feel like you need to finish that Oh no that s fine There appears to be no blue stuff Oh the pickle It s new Oh It only gets blue from the copper so it it does have pickle in it It s just fresh and new So you could you could see that little yogurt container You can put it in that and that has holes in it and then you can just kind of let that float Just kind of put a little in there Like tip it Yeah that s good Okay yeah let s go look at your Oh should we look at those Would you rather do those or Okay let s go Sorry we re going outside now Okay Oh wow What do you think I like them I really like them as not a shell color because they don t seem Can I touch it Sorry I touched it before I asked you I think once you like as I did just find the shell along the stream Right you re transforming it I really like the shell of the spray paint too because it helps tie it in with the metal It makes well it s metallic spray paint so it seems really metal y yeah Right Cool And it makes it a little bit more blingy You know And I like how it reflects the light all the cracks and stuff Yes it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation Especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it Then this unifies them It makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people s clothes Do you think About how would you how will you attach are you thinking of using these in one group Or are they more pendants I think they re more like pendants and I was gonna poke a hole Okay Like two holes in them and I was gonna use a bunch of different strings together So it s kind of like and they re right there And maybe bead it a bunch of beaded strings So really this is like one necklace that s or is it many necklaces that people can layer It s just one necklace Okay all right Well let s can we go look at your sketch book too The other thing is next time it would be better I think to drill the hole first before you paint it Okay Because I m afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole I was going to just poke a hole with a needle Can you do that I think so I mean they re really a lot more soft than metal Oh okay well try it and see if it works But I have a diamond drill bit It can drill and that s what Drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff Okay and also most of these already have holes Oh yeah because of the creature that eats the muscle Yeah I love the hole that s already in there yeah okay All right let s go look at that These probably need to dry a little more Yes Okay okay let s go in There s only five more minutes on here Okay that s good We ll get this and that ll be okay Oh look at that See that s amazing to me because whenever I find coquinas I guess I find the live coquinas I ve never seen the shells like just the shells But they all have a hole This is a great find I got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach Yes Because they all lay next to each other in the sand And when you I mean now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry I m not sure yet because Here I ll come over is this better like this Yeah I could use like I could put them all together on one string on one necklace Sort of like the coral But I don t know I don t think I have enough for that from reproduction Well you have a lot What might be better right because you re right Because then they would nest Right If you just put with cubicle then they don t take up much space What if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one And that could put see how you have sort of charms on your chain You could these could also be sort of like charms hanging down and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring could have a little chain And it could hang down to vary the length or or you said that you like to use did you make your necklace that s woven there That s okay you but you know how to sew So could you sew them on something I could yeah I mean I have some leather strip and that would be keeping with natural materials So that might be interesting I don t know I well I think what you need to do is to experiment sew some do some metal through some and then maybe lay some out And you can see how Chloe has hers laid out in that box so that she can keep it I think you d need a box or a tray and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them Yeah Now what are these Those are Oh and these are a dove s feathers They re so elegant Yes Now do you have your sketch book Can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this Here I think I got it Here you go I could do this with the shell Oh because that s hanging off And then what is this round ring part I m not sure It could just be like a round golden It could be a soldered ring of metal like brass wire soldered together Is this an earring Yes Okay That may be for these Right That was that s what I was planning to do with the shell For that I could do a bunch of different strings or I could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string or something Right right asymmetry Okay I like it And then this is the feather These are jump rings and this is the feather 
 Okay guys yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned we studied we found definitions for Those words were adaptation there s habitat and community Okay adaptation is the first word Who can tell me something about adaptation Karina Adaptation is how animals act like the howler monkeys they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger so they can survive Okay so they can survive right Adaptation helps them survive And then habitat Who can tell me what habitat is Ernesto Where you live Okay it s the environment where they live It s the surroundings okay It s the trees it s the plants it s the ground and it s the climate that they live in And the last one is community Okay so if we re thinking about animals what makes up a community for these animals Who can tell me Sergio The community What makes up a community It s not the environment The animals It s all the animals Do we have just one animal in the community We have many we have many It could be very many Okay we re going to on and I d like you to listen to this sound Shhhh Just listen to this sound Okay you may have and you can hear this sound at night Okay what I d like you yo do right now is tell me one thing that you know about this animal okay If you know the name of this animal go ahead and write that down too First of all let s just write it in our K Just put it under for K What do you know about that animal Just write it down first then we ll talk about it I d like you to discuss what you know also Talk to a neighbor Okay this is what you know so you are going to be looking at that What is something you know about that animal Okay Tell your neighbor What do you know about this animal Just tell a neighbor Tell a neighbor what you know Tell your neighbor Eddie what you know What do you know You can talk out loud guys Okay small ears okay All right so write that down Okay now after that go to what you want to know Go to the W What do you want to know about this animal By the way what animal is this An owl It s an owl It s a Great Horned Owl okay Now what I d like you to do you want to put this information Yea what do you want to know So write one thing about what you want to know What do you want to know Tell a neighbor What do you want to know Sergio You don t have to whisper you can say it How old an owl can live Okay good Good okay Now one thing I want you to think about Let s listen to this sound again okay Listen to the sound again Any predictions and you can just tell me without writing them down What do you think that Why does the owl make the sound that it makes Yea Maybe to warn other owls Warn other owls Anything else Yea Ernesto To communicate And to communicate that s right Okay let s take a look a page twenty three Okay we re going to look at text structure on page 23 This is the Great Horned Owl And I d like everyone to put your finger on the title for this animal the Great Horned Owl Just put your finger so I know you know what the title is Next I d like you to put your finger on the caption Okay and can I have one person read the caption Let s have Karina read the caption Owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark Okay very good Then we have underneath the title of the Great Horned Owl We have what I call bullet points We talked a little bit about them And put your fingers on the bullet points there And let s have Ernesto read those bullet points Bird found in North Central and South America Live in the canopy and understory Understory very good And we live in what continent Eddie what continent do we live in North America North America So we ll find these and actually I will usually hear these at night And usually hear them kind of in the winter time All right let s have the first paragraph Eddie why don t you continue The Great Horned Owl has no ears but can hear anyway It can also see very good even on the darkest night Okay and the second paragraph Makayla An owl hunts for food at night from high in the air When it hears a mouse move or squeak the owl swoops down upon it Swoops okay very good Okay now we ve read about the Great Horned Owl I d like you to tell your neighbor one thing that you learned new about this owl that you are going to put down under the L What is one thing that you learned about the owl Okay so write something down that you ve talked about with your partner or your neighbor Now we re going to continue working in partners here and I m going to give you something to take a look at And I m going to have you guys just close your books for a second After you re done writing close your books Okay I m going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks I want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick okay So take a close look at it all right And take a look at it and then I d like you to put down what you know about that stick okay There are yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also But what is something look at the ends of the stick and let s put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick Okay just write it down or tell your neighbor Tell your neighbor Yeah he bit the stick on here But did he actually cut it Was he able to bite it Yes Yeah he was he was Okay all right now who can tell me what animal this might be Karina A beaver It is a beaver and you will find these in this area What I would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver So let s write that down Just skip this and go right to What do you want to know Tell your neighbor Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it What do you want to know Okay tell your neighbor guys too once you have written it down How old can a beaver live Okay how old can a beaver live That s good Yea Keelie What I want to know how about are they electric Okay Okay I want to know how long they are in their house maybe Yes I want to know how big can they be Okay good I have hair on here It s possible Actually yeah that is very possible you have hair of a beaver I would actually I m going to hang onto that And actually let s put that in the garbage But that s good It s right here Okay i ll take it Okay Yea you re going to find that probably we re not going to look at the sticks too much We need to find insects still living in the stick but we re going to leave that for right now I d like you to take a look at page twenty Take a look at page twenty I do recommend that if you ever by chance go to Deerbro there s a forest near the school here Your parents can take you You might actually see a beaver house Okay let s find out some more information about beaver on page twenty Put your fingers on the title Put your fingers on the title You know what I ll take that Here we go And you know what let me recollect these because we have Let me collect those back Thank you There we go Okay put your fingers on the beaver the title okay Can I have one person read the bullet again Bullet marks Sergio go ahead Mammal found in North America Europe and Asia Lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor okay and can you name another mammal If you happen to know what the mammal might be Can you name another mammal Whale A whale is a mammal and we are also mammals Okay the next paragraph I d like to have one person read that paragraph Karina Beavers eat bark twigs leaves and roots They have wide flat tails These tails help beavers to clear a placement Beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur They also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur This oil helps keep them warm in the water Okay before we go on as we re going to be looking at a lot of things think about what it is you re learning What s something new that you re learning about this beaver Now before we go on everybody put your finger on the caption Okay caption Makayla what does the caption say A beaver s fur keeps it warm in the snow All right very good So let s take one more thing We re going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen So now let s go to page seventeen And this talks a little bit more about a beaver And the title let s put our finger on the title of page 17 What does the title say Keelie Graph Section Diagram Okay we re looking at page 17 right here Put your finger on the top of the diagram And that s the title What does it say Keelie Beaver lodge Okay what is we know a beaver is the animal What s a lodge Keelie Their house where they live Yea it s like their house Okay next there s a caption built into the diagram and it s green Let s have Sergio read the caption there This beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor If it wouldn t float the lodge will have to be rebuilt Okay very good Let s get some more information There s some other things in the diagram to give us information Makayla Some lodges are two meters 6 5 high Okay very good And Keelie The lodge is made from logs and sticks Okay and Eddie the last one Beavers come in and out under the water Okay so this is where they live This is how they live and why do you think they build their house this way Anybody What do you think they do Why do they build it this way Karina Because when they when people come like hunters if they want to catch them It is going to be difficult for them Okay like predators Other predatory animals Yeah So this is a way they adapt So how do they adapt to survive in their environment Makayla To enter from the underground water Okay can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence Beavers Beavers adapt to Beavers adapt how Yea Karina Beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water Okay so they adapt in that way other predators can t see when they re coming And as we saw on the sticks the sticks they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this okay So what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again Using the word habitat I d like you to tell me What s the habitat of a beaver They live in lodges They live in lodges Okay what s around their lodge Yeah Karina Sticks and wood Okay sticks but then what is this blue stuff here Water It s water Yeah so they actually go underwater to get into their home And that makes it very safe So I would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer Okay Okay once you ve got one third okay And Eddie when you ve got something why don t you tell your neighbor When you ve got something tell your neighbor what you learned Like this Okay Actually right here yea What you ve learned Okay and if you were to go out somewhere and you were in the woods what would you see What do you think you would see from this house This is all water so all you re going to see Are you going to see the hole that s here No No What do you think you re going to see The sticks Just like a stick Just a mound of sticks about two meters high Which is probably about that tall 
 Take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you re going to be working on And this we want to remind you that it s kind of dinner party conversation ish You agree with people at dinner parties You disagree with people at dinner parties but it s civil because it s friends that you invited over to your house You don t raise your you don t raise your hand at dinner parties You wait until you wait until You wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking of course because that s polite dinner conversation You add on to what one another says But like I said we don t necessarily have to agree And then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party somebody else brings something else up So you can raise your own questions as well So the seminar is open and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of The Veldt What did it mean like George having like I think that I know a lot of times where he especially in the towards the back he it goes back a little ways He s like talking a lot of things like comments turning comment commen I can t say that word He says they re going to turn the house down possibly for a month and how he pick out the picture painter And he was telling his he was like talking to his son a lot and like about not about doing what his son would not want to have happen and how he spoiled his children so much So he takes out there s a lot of things that his son his son and daughter it just doesn t say as much wouldn t like because yeah But he wasn t like he wasn t like I agree that Oh yeah I m gonna go die today I agree that it was He didn t want to die I agree that it was Of course he didn t want to die Who wants to die Except for if you re suici you know suicidal I agree that and on Page 15 where it says um it s mostly on 16 but starts on Page 15 Won t this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children s affections It assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents and now you want to come along and shut it off Kind of shows why that they hate them And because it because it s since the nursery is their parents it s like some guy who thinks he can tell you coming along and can tell you to kill your parents you know It s the same thing as they re doing though They re killing their parents Well But they think the nursery is their parents they don t think their parents are their parents They don t matter as much as parents If they d been nice to them and now they re going to turn everything off then isn t it imbalanced So now they re relying on the house because that s what they ve learned to do as Yeah It d be like take an example people are killing their parents And on Page 15 it says like I also think that it s the dad says I sen The psychologist says I sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now you re letting them die in some way So if they like they don t really know like when someone says no to them they ve been spoiled so much they don t even like well they just can t take it It makes them go all crazy and stuff So they wanted to kill them because they like couldn t fly to New York so Yeah Because I think And if their parents and if their parents and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents then maybe not But since their parents don t really take care of them it s the house that takes care of them Yeah And then the The house and the room replaced their parents Yeah Their parents and friends It s not like the parents could They don t have friends because they re the room they get all these adventures because of the room Yeah They don t have friends And they kind of like rely on the house to give them stuff all the time If the house refused them if it could then I don t think that they would want to kill it I think that it s just because they don t feel like their parents are actually their they don t they feel their parents aren t important to them So when they say no On page on page 13 the mom s saying That sounds stressful Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it And brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath The kid s like now relying on everything He s never had to do something for himself So he doesn t really like know Yeah He s gotten so like stuck on having everyone do things for him he thinks like doing your own thing would be like A challenge Yeah Like and I guess you can use an example as Wall E a show People get like so fat and they rely on everything so much that like they have to move in chairs and they when you golf it s virtual golf there s a robot for you So they just they take robotics and machines to the next level and they it s all they rely on And so many people don t have to work Yeah and weren t the ones that like bought the house that they were actually the cause because they were the ones like on Page 5 and 11 they even said that We were the ones who bought the house We were the ones who got us into this mess So but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children which made them mad So again they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house I think it Like don t you think that people would be sort of obese like Elliot said Yeah They would be They would be Yeah but then they d be like everyone else in the world But then they also Yeah and Getting exercise But they re obese And also I think that it s George Hadley s fault not necessarily both the parents because the mom didn t really do as much Because like well the quote over there it said that like she s the one who let them in for a minute But She just wanted to be nice She just wanted to be nice But I think like on Page two it says But nothing s too good for our children George said So I don t think it s as much Lydia s fault because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there She just wanted to be nice to the kids because George had shut it off so abruptly But I think it s more George s fault that they spoiled them and that therefore gets himself killed Does anyone know when this story was written Because I m guessing it was 1950 All right Because I was I m guessing it was wri I was guessing it was written when women weren t like thought of that highly Because Wendy only actually speaks once and is a sniveling idiot most of the time And Lydia s and Lydia Hadley is pretty passive And it s the guys that are have all the action and have anything really going on Except in the final scene Well yeah But that she on She says one line One line in the whole book basically I know but Lydia sort of has a bit of action Yeah but She doesn t do much She doesn t like She s pretty passive She doesn t like um disagree with her husband or her kids She doesn t do anything like that She just follows whatever her husband says Maybe she has a few opinions but not really And Wendy says four words alone in the whole thing so Well I mean you hear her screaming but other than that Is that a word Well that was Unless she s saying it Close enough at the same time as Peter like when they both come in and say Hello mom and dad Doesn t really count or when they both say Mommy daddy come quick But she s saying it at the same time She only says four words by herself in the entire story The screams are actually their parents when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being Yeah they realized that at the end but they didn t really make that very clear They re like suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar I thought the whole book or the whole story that it was like the kids screams But it s actually the parents What are Yeah because it s really not clear on that I figured that it s actually so they all Well I m it s more it s nicer to have like a mystery kind of Mm hmm Yeah I figured that it s the author s fault The what The author s But How is it the author s fault Because it s his story Well the author wrote it That doesn t make any sense But Carl the author Yeah that doesn t make much sense It s not his fault It s the it s totally off topic Yeah I agree with Elise When I didn t really get who the screams were until the very end where they said yeah that I think it s on Page um 19 But yeah that they were it says on Page screamed and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar So I thought it was the kids the whole time I thought Aaron was saying something before but then everyone What I was going to say is the a little while ago when I was going to ask you why do people think it s like Peter Hadley or other because I mean The other is both of them Because more or less the majority did George Hadley So why just those people who did that why did they do that I understand with Peter Hadley because it is his he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents But it s not his fault he got spoiled He can t help it if his parents spoiled him Yeah because Actually even if the parents had been played more of a parent role they would still probably have preferred the nursery because You don t need to the parents could still say no and the nursery does they can like do whatever they want with it I agree with the both parents part of it even though the mom wasn t as involved as George was the mother was not do posing a part in the kids life as being the mom and the house was So that caused them to think the house was their parents and the house was their family This is Indirectly directly I think You can go Directly the Peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying Directly Directly But indirect well directly the lions were Oh my God Indirectly but directly it was mostly Peter but indirectly it was it was kind of everybody s fault I kind of agree with like both the parents and then the dad Because in the beginning the parents are like slowly taking away some things like the painter and not letting them go to New York And that kind of builds up their anger But in the end the dad just wants to shut it all off And then the son starts getting really mad and like threatening them finally they like get really mad and then they start imagining the parents dying and then They ve been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing I think it was the parents fault and the inventor Because I mean none of it would have happened if they wouldn t have had the just like the super technology house and the nursery So it s technology s fault It s not the inventor s fault because he didn t know But it s not the it s not the inventor s fault that they thought though If he wouldn t have made it it would have never happened And also if the dad wouldn t have bought it it would never happened too So that s my two opinions They couldn t But they bought it but they made it and bought it to be a good thing not a bad one No one invented it so that you would so that it d be used as a murder machine They didn t just make it like on the advertisement Greatest Murder Machine Ever Perfect for murdering your parents We don t know like why he built it Maybe it was because of that but you don t know like exactly what his point of the invention was It was to like study the children s thoughts It was to study their minds Because the children He said that but what if it s not He s a liar The children were mentally impaired and they needed to be looked up on and they wanted to know what they were thinking so So a psychologist Another good quote to show that it was to show that it might have that it could have been the parents fault was that on Page 11 it said yeah George said Who was it that who was it said Children are carpets They should be stepped on occasionally Because the parents didn t they didn t do anything to the kids They They didn t really step on them that much until the end They just did what they want They just all of a sudden just like flattened them Yeah they just did it so abruptly Yeah they just started and let it go It was just like bam you re dead No wonder they wanted them dead Guys let s try and talk one person at a time or else we can t hear My turn Okay On Page 15 it says that the dad went from Santa Santa to Scrooge And like if he would have taken away like one thing at a time over a period of time I don t think the kids would be like like killing them But it says he just took all the good stuff away at once and they got like really mad That s also kind of dangerous though Because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter So it was they still could ve gotten mad It s also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away because they get more and more mad All the anger I have another opinion that I was trying to say but then I let Fiona go first That s not fair No that s not it s my fault All the anger built up because Anyway um 
 Viewing my art room from the front corner I have a storage area on the right hand side Entry to the art room and paint storage is right by the door Uh a cart for paint supplies that can be wheeled out into the room I have a large white cabinet for all of my paper and on the other side storage for student art work I have a dry erase board a digital white board and a bulletin board for instruction for students in the front of the room We often sit right in the center of the room There s also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in My tables are shaped around there in a U shaped formation each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling Indicating the table there s a red table orange yellow green blue and so forth Each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables In the very back corner is the teacher desk Two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that s hooked up to the digital whiteboard Across the back of the room I have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work and store some ongoing large artworks On the back wall I have more storage metal cabinets rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from And directly below me is our class pet this is where Shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating Like rabbits and dogs dinosaurs And kitty cats And puppies So first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures Listen so that we have time for working I need everyone to put in bubble We are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long long long ago The very oldest art in the whole world Are horses and bulls inside of a cave So the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals About horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them Put hands down put hands down dinosaurs yeah Well that was after the dinosaurs But I m looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here Does anyone recognize some of those animals Yeah Izaiah do you Izaiah Izaiah with a Z Do you want to go up and point Come up and show us some animals that you recognize Only animals who only only Listen She s the teacher right now What s it Kangaroo What else Let her answer Fish and turtle and um crocodile and a duck Yeah and some kind of a bird Good job Did you notice that these are all made with dots That s how some artists who live in Australia Kimberly come right here in front of me Turn around so you can see That s how some artists in Australia make animals And they kind of show what s inside of them don t they It s really good that you notice that Izaiah Do you have a comment I know all those animals Good so you were naming them right along with her Raiden why is your name up your hand up You said last time we have to finish our Oh we do have to finish those you re right We will don t worry Okay Next What kind of animal is that A horse A horse You know what it says at the top It s a horse of a different color Because what color is it Blue Kind of like the Wizard of Oz right there Why boys and girls Why is the horse blue What do you think Why is the horse blue To make the horse beautiful To make it beautiful Why else would it be blue Maybe because it There s another one It s a unicorn horse isn t it What Shhhh what I m curious Izaiah why would an artist make a horse blue Because it might be a unicorn Well it could be Why Because it might be a different kind of animal Yeah it might be a different type of animal horse Have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination And used your favorite colors in it How many people do that sometimes I know I do Sometimes I might make an animal but instead of making him brown maybe I ll make him pink and purple and yellow Ooooooh And make him a little bit more imaginative Sometimes at my dad s house all by myself What else do we have Another horse Here s a fancy prancy horse Now the other horse was kind of looking down but what s this horse doing What s this horse doing Jumping Flying He s walking or galloping isn t he He looks Look how he s standing Look at the two horses If you had to tell me how this horse is feeling Sad Why do we think sad Emma why do you think sad Because he s looking down He is looking down isn t he Maybe he s sad because his family just got killed by another animal Oh I hope that didn t happen He could be sad about something that happened What about this horse Happy Why Melanie why do you think he looks happy Because he still has a family of his own Because why Because he still has a family of his own That s not why That s not why Izaiah you might have a different idea than Melanie Isn t it okay to have a different idea Yeah So I need you sitting Kimberly and Regan you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun Izaiah so it s okay to have what was your idea about why he might be happy Because he s walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals Oh my but that wouldn t be very happy would it You think he looks happy Are there any other words you can think of to describe him He s prancing around Usually if you re in a bad mood do you walk around like this With your head up No I used to do this too That s not prancing that s stomping But prancing is when you have your head up isn t it Kimberly Kimberly Right here Come over here by me Maybe maybe he was doing this because on his arm There s something on his arm Oh it could be like a bandage couldn t it It might just be the way it s painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him Is that what you re noticing What are you noticing but one of my family died Awww That is sad isn t it Really really really old That happens sometimes I m sorry family died in a fire Guess what Guess what Shhhh Kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me Brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom not crawling on the floor You have to color inside of it You might want to draw his shell first to make it really big Look at mine Can I see Good job Make these lines really really dark Hey look at my turtle Go back over it like this Boys and girls if your paper s kind of cause you re pushing so hard then you re drawing dark enough Okay they should really be pressing hard with that Good go over it really really dark That s dark enough It looks great Oh Kimberly yes And put your name on the front with the crayon Well look Izaiah here s two choices for your shell You can start with an oval like that or you can start like this Okay Yeah but I think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle Which one do you like Make it really big Perfect There you go Look at my turtle Boys and girls I want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint Okay Keep darkening your lines Okay darken those lines We have to go and get our paint Boys and girls darken every line and I m going to come around and as soon as I see that yours is nice and dark I ll put the paint on your table Okay This is yours That s good that s good This is dark enough What I want you to trace over is the black parts And see these pencil lines You have to trace over top of them Or the paint will cover them up So what color would you like to use there What color would you like to trace these in Come pick a color Come sit down Tyler start working on your design No start working on your designs in the middle That s perfect Nice and dark Boys and girls see how dark these lines are This is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be You want to go back over it and trace it really dark That one looks good too Nice and dark That s awesome Start drawing I need yellow Boys and girls would you put your name on Pardon the interruption please come to the office please come to the office Put your name right here While you re getting ready to paint put your name on the front in crayon Nice and dark write your name nice and dark with your crayon Well trace over it with the crayon Look at mine As soon as you re sitting down Caitlin I m coming around to look Boys and girls when you re ready you may put your hand up and I ll come around and check your pictures You are ready Yours looks really nice Good He made me draw it for you Very good Melody I m waiting for that hand to go up Isaiah ah That looks great While you re waiting for your paint make those darker Shhhh Darken these a little bit Izaiah what are you doing Oh I like your turtle 
 Yeah Why don t we list that up here Okay Here is what you re going to do Go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick Put those pencils away in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and just to make sure you haven t Now you have identified you have taken this work of art you ve seen what it is and you ve taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used Now we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements What kind of thought feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements with this subject So who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found What s one Shapes Shapes What s another one Color Color Shape lines Value Value Texture You guys with those elements they re telling you something So here s what we re going to We re going to put on our thinking pairing and sharing hats So whatever I do that so you guys can pair and share together will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference Thank you All right First question ready The first question is how does this man feel Now think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel No talking Think to yourself Think Shh You ve got to tell me why too Don t just think about feeling Tell me why Two people look like they re pairing already Don t pair yet Now tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking is feeling is feeling All right Now we re ready to share with the whole group So I m going to start with right here with Jermaine s group and we re going to go around and each person is going to get a turn or each pair is going to get a turn So first what was your group thinking How did he feel Sad Why Because the color blue is a sad color And he looked down So he had two reasons he had the body position because he s kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten good job he said that sad and the color blue go together What do you guys think How does he feel I think he feels happy He s smiling and he s playing the guitar Okay because he s creating music Maybe that s what makes him happy I heard Miss Webster had a disagreement when they were pairing Miss Webster what is your take What do you think he s feeling Tell me what you think he is Sit up tell me what you think he is I think he s sad because Okay Because why He looks what Say it again honey Don t be embarrassed It s okay to have a different opinion I think he is lonely because he doesn t have any friends There s nobody else in that picture He is by himself in the picture Maybe he s lonely We don t know Okay So we had a difference of opinion That s okay Next pair I think he s sad because he s looking down If he was happy he d be Whoa Wait a minute She just said this man doesn t have anything to eat Why do you think he doesn t have any Because his shirt is torn he don t have no pants and he don t have no socks So you re telling me he looks what Is he rich or is he poor No He s poor Okay That is very good insight on not only the details but also just what those details are telling us okay Do you have something else to add What would you say I said I think he was happy to sit alone I think he s happy because he just Okay So you think the guitar looks even though his clothing looks torn his guitar looks nice right Maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice Maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes Maybe not Last pair tell me what you think he s feeling I think he s One at a time I think he s It looks like he s playing a sad song He s playing a sad song and he s playing Why do you think it looks like he s playing a sad song Because he s bowing his head down and his face don t look very happy Okay You guys next question I can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat Did you have something different than that Okay Go ahead I think he s sad because he looks like he s homeless Oh maybe he s homeless Now why do you think he s homeless Because his shirt s torn on the side Are there any other clues besides his clothing We already had Miss Marshall tell us about his clothing What other clues do we have that makes us think he s homeless without talking and making noise Jermaine do you have a clue why he might be homeless Why Because he s outside by his self He looks like me might be outside This might be a step that he s sitting on Next question Next question what do you think the artist is trying to tell us What is the important message put your hands down Think What is the message Why is the artist painting this picture of this man I have one person she s got herself in the thinking posture She s thinking Think please Think think think I ve got a good thinker at this table I hope you re thinking honey Okay Now pair up Ready Pair and share with your table mate Get paired up Thirty more seconds to share I hear some good talking so I m giving you 30 more seconds Why don t you share this time because you shared last time Okay So you re going to share this time Let s see you sitting up nice and tall We re going to share with the entire group We all learn from each other You guys we re going to start with the opposite way I m going to go this way Can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us by painting this picture I m sorry just a second Could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve You guys when you re listening to what he s saying he s trying to tell you what he thinks what his table mate thinks So you need to turn your body make eye contact and really listen to what he s saying okay Okay Go again I think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he s homeless He doesn t have any money He doesn t have any value Okay When you mean value do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean Like he seems very sad Okay So you re talking about the color right Okay Next group I think that the artist is trying to persuade him Wait a minute Say that word again He s trying to what Persuade Persuade us what Persuade us to think what Persuade us He feels real mad or trying to do music or something Okay Is that what your team came up with You came up with something different than your team You had a disagreement right I think that I was not Do you think the artist wants you to be like him No What do you think the artist wants you to learn from him He won t have nothing to work You can have a better life right Okay This group could you put your feet down It s your turn You re going to share with us what your team came up with You can share Come on You can talk to us Remember that there s no wrong answer It s just what you think 
 One eighth plus one eighth is Oh one eighth okay Is she adding one eighth together a bunch of times Where do you see that Can you come up and show us You have to get seven of them Okay Katriana could you add that number sentence up above your picture also So I like how you re all thinking while she s writing this There s a couple different ways we can represent this I think Anielli and lots a groups had their hand up were right that she did I can see she took seven pizzas and divided it into eight pieces for eight people And I also see where and when I talk to Katriana she said Well I got one eighth plus one eighth and one eighth and one eighth and one eighth How much is that gonna add up to equal She s got one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth Seven eighths Seven eighths okay And that s how much pizza she told us What about seven divided by eight A bunch a groups kept their hand down after Anielli shared that number sentence But it s not a complete number sentence until we can finish that equation What would seven divided by eight come out to equal do you think Talk at your group for just a minute again I think we re just a little bit unsure What are you thinkin for seven divided by eight Let s come talk it over with this group You check with this group I ll check with this group What are ya ll thinkin up here Well what do you see in her representation You see how many pizza s Okay seven pizzas Eight people And eight people Did she divide those seven pizzas into eight groups Okay so we ve just gotta figure out how much then that s gonna come out to equal I m not sure Talk about it as a group You can draw it on the back Okay Yes thank you ma am Okay thank you so much for talkin with your group What did you or someone at your group think again If we ve got seven pizzas divided by eight people Katia We ve got 56 divided by eight because there s 56 pieces and it s kinda Okay so you noticed there s and it s cut into Eight Eight slices So you were thinking something a little bit differently Savannah We I thought the same way except I thought that it was gonna be 56 Divided by seven because Each one of them is shaded in and they re all going to eight people Okay Let me ask us all this I love that we re relating this back thinking about some of our math facts and how that can tie in and help us But what did Katriana start with here What do you think the first thing she did was What did she do Steven Drew seven or eight pizzas Did she draw seven pizzas or eight pizzas Seven Seven pizzas Is that what she did first Okay She drew out her seven pizzas So we wanna know or we need to know that that s what she started with What did she divide those pizzas into Into eighths Into eight We see she cut em into eight pizzas Brennan I did I was thinking either 700 or seven tenths Okay So we re thinking back to fractions I think since we don t have a definite answer we don t need to yet Let s leave this kinda open ended but I m gonna circle it so that we remember to come back to it So we ve gotta a great number sentence that one thing Katriana did was add up one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth and she got seven eighths and we re gonna keep thinking about I saw a bit of agreement that seven pizzas she divided by eight people But we need to figure out ladies how much that would mean each person gets So put a big arrow So as we continue let s keep that in our mind Okay thank you Can I have The person who put this one up in black Faith was that you Will you come tell us what you did and what you think the answer might be here How much pizza each person got Well I knew there was eight soccer players so there were seven pizzas so I did seven pizzas Then I divided six of em up in to fourths and then I numbered em all And then when I got to eight I started one two three back over again when I got to another eight I did it again but then I realized that there wasn t enough or more so I split the last pizza up into eighths and that equals up to eight people Okay and that equaled up to eight people So how much pizza do you think each person gets Well I think that each person would get at least one fourth and Okay so let s write this up here So you said each person gets let s put it up in black How much Like let s say person number 1 How much pizza do they get Will you show us They would get one two three They would get three fourths Okay And then one eighth Three fourths and one eighth Like this Okay do you know how much that is all together That would That would equal up to four Okay So let s think about this one for a minute Do you have any questions for Faith about how she figured this out Okay I think she did a great job explaining her picture So she showed us where each person gets three fourths plus one eighth Will you talk at your group How much is that How much is that total Thank you if you wanna join a group Good explanation Okay group what do we think Four twelfths You agree with her four twelfths How did you come up with four twelfths By adding those two together How did you add them together Three plus one would equal four and then four would be the numerator because you added the two top numbers And if you added the two bottom numbers it would equal twelve for the denominator Okay so is there a picture or is there a way that we could show this with pictures that that would come out to equal four twelfths See on the back of your paper once will you draw a representation of four twelfths How come Because I thought that if the denominators were different we couldn t add them up directly Oh So we tried to get the denominators the same What do we call that Equal to fractions I like that your thinking back to remember your vocabulary I tried to tell Katia that if it has a different number on the bottom then we re supposed to add the on the bottom to I don t know Have we learned to do that before Well no but I just thought about it and I ve been practicing Okay So if we haven t learned it yet we ve gotta think about how are we gonna figure it out right Okay so keep thinking It s okay that we re debating between a couple different answers just tryin to explain to each other why you re thinking four twelfths and why you re thinking something different I thought it was because Whenever you add it up And the denominator Okay So I understand where you got the four slices But what size are those slices Would be my next question Because we wanna make sure every soccer player gets the same amount cause I would be upset if I didn t get as much pizza as you did I like pizza Okay Okay well it says four twelfths so we re shading four Do you have 12 pieces there We have one two three Okay If I can have your attention back I know some of you are still discussing and doing a great job But I wanna make sure that we ve got time to get through the rest of our solutions before we re out of time for the day Hailey if I can have you close the door again for us And can I hear what a couple of your groups came up with I heard three or four different things as I was going around Three fourths Hannah said each person gets three fourths of a pizza and one eighth Faith said How much is that Yes I m sorry Faith said since ya ll sat next to each other I still mess that up Three fourths and one eighth How much did you or your group think that came out to be Nathan We came up with seven eighths Seven eighths Because when you take three fourths and then you take another circle that shows one eighth then you divide the three fourths into eighths then add the the ones that used to be three fourths and that equals seven eighths Can you come up and show that to us I think I think I followed in my head but did you all have trouble making that picture in your head Yes A little bit yeah Can you show us You can draw it here or over here we ve got lots of room Nathan you re right Shhh Okay let s see what he does Okay can you step to the step to the side so everybody in the class can see you There you go And then if you divide that into eighths then you add one of the eighths then you add this over here It comes out to be seven eighths Can I just get in agreement or disagreement somebody who had shared with us What do you think about what he just did I saw him draw three eighths at one pizza and one or three fourths of one pizza and one eighth of the next And then I saw him cut this one into eighths How many eighths was three fourths When you cut it Six eighths And then he put one more eighth over and seven eighths What are you thinkin about that Brazy I agree with him Why Because our group said that we know that four eighths is equal to twelve fourths is equivalent to seven eighths and his picture we can see that it s two and when he was workin it out we could see that it was right and so I agree with him Okay Brennan I agree with him but I have a different explanation Okay One fourth is equal to two eighths but then you take Oh I m sorry Let me write this as you re saying it so we can follow it So you said One fourth is equal to two eighths Okay So We multiplied the three and the numerator with three fourths Okay By two which comes from the two eighths and it would equal up to six eighths plus that one extra eighth it would be seven eighths Okay so you said three fourths is equivalent to Six eighths Six eighths okay And then just add the other one seven eighths Okay so then you did six eighths plus one eighth equals seven eighths like that Okay can I just see a quick on your remotes do you agree or disagree with Nathan and Brennan So A is I agree B I disagree or I m confused What s confused We ll just do A and B A is I agree I understand or B is I disagree or I m confused How are you feeling right now about what Brennan and Nathan just said They re two different explanations I just wanna see right now do you agree or disagree with what Brennan and Nathan just said And again they were saying that three fourths plus one eighth is gonna come out to equal seven eighths And they each kinda explained it a different way One with words and one with a picture Need a couple more people to vote if they agree or disagree Number three number eleven we need a vote from you please Where is remote number three There it comes Okay What do we what do we know by looking at this graph What do we know by looking at this graph Thomas 
 What if it comes from like a polluted creek or something or some kind of bad water system in the ground Number three I say crystal clear and filtered I said how dirty the water gets How good the water is for you It doesn t have stuff dying in it it s crystal clear and it doesn t smell Okay class if we can pull back together please as a group I was hearing excellent discussions between each of the three questions and I think we have some very valuable points to go ahead and talk about So what we re gonna do is kind of create a little bit of a list up here to help us remind later when I go to show you something So we re gonna start again with that first question and I m looking for you to participate and share some of those questions together So it says again how do you know if water is safe or not And I heard wonderful responses so can I hear some of those please Brandon please start us Color and odor Okay so you know if water is safe or not depending on again the color and the odor Good what are some other responses Brandon Remember where you got it from Like if it was in a creek that looks fine it s probably safe to drink but if it s from a polluted creek that has a really weird color to it or it s in a weird location don t drink it Okay so I m commenting here I have it depends on the source you re getting it from and so if it s a creek that looks to be clean or clear then you know it s probably okay And if it looks to have like a weird color I think you mentioned again to it or polluted or in a weird location then maybe it s not safe All right what were some of your other responses Jack Um if it goes through a quality filter Okay if it goes through a quality filter And Jack can you maybe think of an example of a quality filter A Culligan filter for the drinking water Okay so a Culligan filter that you can use to filter out the water Okay good Madeline There s no large pieces of trash or anything in the water Okay so you can look for visible signs of large trash and Madeline what was the second part of that Nothing that looks unnatural in it Okay so nothing that looks unnatural Great Anybody else any answers for number one Again how do you know if it s safe or not Lexi I think you had another answer that may have been covered up here What did you say when I was talking with your group about The smell Okay the smell again the odor of it Okay great Brandon you thought of another one If there s something dead in it If there s something dead in it so again we re going based on those visual aspects of it Good Well we re gonna come back to that here in just a moment so we ll move on to number two When are times when the water might not be safe Walker After an earthquake or another disaster Okay so after an earthquake And Walker can I have you expand a little bit What would be so significant after an earthquake or another disaster that would make the water not safe Because maybe something fell in the water or I don t know I just heard that before Okay so you heard it before and if something fell in the water Did you happen to see at all in Japan after the tsunami came through there Do you remember any of those images Yeah kinda they were different colors and yeah Okay and I think I heard somebody else say that they remembered seeing a point that maybe we can add onto Elvis At the beach At the beach What do you mean by at the beach There s different times where the water might not be safe Okay can you think of a specific example like have you experienced a time when you weren t allowed to be at the beach When somethings dangerous in the water Okay if something s dangerous in the water Sometimes they might tell you that it s not safe to be there Okay Any other times that might make the water not safe Amelia can you think of any times where the water might not be safe I have after storms like um Walker did Okay what are some things then because this is something I m hearing so far What are some things after the storm that might be in the water besides I think you said some stuff can fall in the water What are some of the things that might be in the water that would make it not safe Aashi can you think of something that might get in the water Um like tree branches or animals Okay so tree branches and animals that s good Can you think of anything else that might get in the water that maybe wouldn t normally be there Kris Trash Trash okay Can you think of a specific kind of trash Lexi Glass Glass And what would be the danger of glass getting in the water It s sharp and can cut yourself Okay so there s a chance of getting injured if you cut yourself What else think outside the box a little bit more What else could get in the water that you would not normally want in your water Madeline Plastic bags and then you can suffocate animals Okay so plastic bags that they suffocate animals something along those lines Elvis Oil and gasoline Oil and gasoline good Brandon Toxins Toxins okay Jack Plastic six pack holders Because it strangles the fish and everything Okay now lets think I m glad you guys are all concerned about the fish and the animals and all of that but what about we as humans can you think of anything that would get in the water that would be potentially harmful to us afterward Go ahead Pesticides Pesticides okay Brandon Fertilizer Fertilizers Elvis A car What is it again A car A car okay All right well we ll come back to those in just a minute So looking at we ve kind of come up with a list here of how you would determine if things are safe or not So then I guess my question would become if you look at it s color and you look at if it s in a source that looks safe or not how would you be able to determine if something is safe to drink So maybe that might change your perspective a little bit So is there a difference between being able to drink something and maybe being able to swim in something In fact let me give you just a minute to talk about that with your partner for a minute so my question to you again is it are there different things we should look for in water that we drink versus maybe water that we swim in or take a shower in And I want you to talk about that with your partner and jot down a couple notes about that so go ahead That s interesting to hear you saying shower water isn t as filtered as your drinking water Our pool is safe they put a water cover over our pool so it was different At our pool they changed from too much chlorine can burn people s eyes so they changed it Yeah definitely a bigger job but they put a small amount of chlorine in it so all the bacteria that s on us if you go swim in the pool it wouldn t matter as opposed to in the shower because it s different Even if you do have a water cover still it could seep through and that s how they clean it When they open the pool it takes like a month because they have to go through the water thing and all the filters Okay we ll come back together as a group one more time Thank you all again I hear great discussions going on So let s talk about this There s some very neat ideas of whether you think something is safe to drink versus whether or not it s okay to shower or to swim in So what were some comments you were talking about in your smaller groups Again I heard some great discussions going on Mikenna what did your group talk about Shower water isn t as filtered as drinking water Okay so in their group they believe that shower water was not as filtered as what the water is that you drink in so if it s not as filtered where would your drinking water be coming from that maybe your shower water isn t coming from Okay is there a reason that maybe you thought along sometime where the shower water is not as filtered as your drinking water No No okay It just makes sense to you that maybe the stuff that comes out of the tap to drink is not necessarily the same thing coming out of your pipes for the shower Okay what were some other comments about that Larry what did you guys talk about May I have your attention please Would all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee Again all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee Thank you Okay so Larry to expand upon that and I think he brought up a really good point He said that maybe the water that you were you saying Larry swimming or showering He was saying that the water we drink Hold on just one second Isaiah just one second Okay good I wanted to make sure I wasn t saying it incorrectly So what he was saying is in other words when you shower or when you are going swimming that water is not necessarily going in your body you re not consuming that water so there would be a difference possibly between the water you re swimming in versus the water that you re drinking Walker I said that you would swim in darker water than you drink or shower in Okay so sometimes you think that the water you ve been in when you swim is darker So going back to the color difference that talked about here Okay interesting Lexi The shower water and the water that we drink I think is sort of the same but they go through a different process but if we go swimming at our community pool it s different because there s more chlorine and stuff so you have bacteria on you and you re just swimming you not really intaking it But at your house when you drink or take a shower it s different Okay Would you say that Because I think it s probably safe to say you guys mostly agree that there is a difference between drinking water and water you would shower in versus water that maybe you would go swimming in So what are some of those differences What might be what might they have to do to that water Lexi was talking about maybe it would have to be treated differently or that there would be chemicals added to it So can you think of what they would do to the water in a swimming pool versus water that you drink to make it different I think Jack mentioned about filtering and Mikenna also brought up the point about it being filtered different Brandon Well they put more chemicals in the swimming pool because there s gonna be more germs and when people swim in it so that will kill off the germs As in drinking water is not as much chemicals because there s not really any germs you re just drinking it so Okay good So what I m hearing is the amount of something so would you all agree as a class if we were to drink swimming water would you die No No probably not right But the amount of the chemical that is in the water might be something that would cause some effects or cause some harm to you So do you think that there is chlorine in your drinking water Because we said it s in the swimming pool probably to help kill off bacteria Do you think that and I m hearing a little bit of a disagreeance here so I d love to hear your conversation in just a minute Elvis what do you think There is chlorine in the drinking water but then they purify it so So they purify out the chlorine after they put the chlorine into the drinking water Yeah Okay good And Isaiah what were you thinking about I think you were saying no that there isn t the chlorine My question is if there was chlorine in drinking water I mean you can purify it but it may still stay around that water then why would you drink it I mean sure it can knock out the bacteria and germs but why drink it if it has chlorine in it Because that s not good for you Okay and going back to the amounts of it and you re thinking that even the smallest amount might not be healthy for you to put in your system Okay Jack Well for a normal tap system I think it s the last or second last step they do is they insert really small amount of chlorine into all tap water usually in a normal town And so then a lot of people have chlorine in their drinking water but for some people who have specialized filters for drinking water they re designed to filter out all of the chlorine so that it s mostly just water that they re getting So some people have a filter installed Okay and would you be able to tell based on the color because that seems to be what a lot of people are using as their indicator of good water Would you be able to tell just by the color whether or not there s a lot of chlorine in it Maybe maybe not I don t know if this contributes to it but sometimes I look at my drinking water compared to the tap water and the tap water is a lot more foggy so I don t know if that s because the chlorine or because it s aerated or something but I don t know Okay good thank you for sharing that Elvis You can buy those little filters that you can screw onto your taps so that way it filters down the water I have one and it filters out tap water Okay and it s filtering out more of the amount or maybe none of it at all Okay Let s go back oh go ahead Madeline I would just like to say to Isaiah s comment we sort of have to have chlorine in our water because there would be more bacteria if we didn t so there s a reason for it and it s not that much So it would do you less harm to have the chlorine in the water than to not have it Okay so the benefits of what you re saying is that you would at least have to have a little bit to kill off the bacteria and that would outweigh the fact of you not having anything at all and then being exposed to maybe whatever is in the water that the chlorine is not killing off right Okay very good Let s look at We ve used again some criteria and let s look at that final question of what is your definition of water quality So in other words I think Jordan I heard in your discussion could you read your answer for us one more time about what you think water quality is to you Water quality is how good the water is for you to drink Good how good the water is for you to drink Can I hear another definition of water quality Kris what did you decide How clean the water was How clean the water was okay And how would you determine if the water is clean or not What was your number one indicator When you drink it When you drink it okay So if you drink it and you know that it s clean then it has good water quality to it All right Isaiah My definition of water quality is how much of the water is polluted and how much of the water is pure So polluted versus pure and then kind of a ratio of if it s polluted and more pure then it s better water quality Okay Rachel how about your definition of water quality We said that water quality was how much of the water is pure water and how much of it s polluted Okay so going back to that same definition together as you all talked And Ashani what did you think water quality would be How good the water is because some water it like tastes different you can tell Okay so the taste Have you ever experienced where water might taste a little different can you think of an example My aunt s house when we go to her house it s always different from our house And what kind of taste would you say It s gross It s gross water Maybe back to when we were talking about well water in here versus the regular city water and it has a different taste to it So what we re gonna do is using your ideas so far you guys have told me again based on color and you mentioned about the smell of it and you ve mentioned about tasting the water So I have here three different liquids that I m going to go around and show you and on your paper you re going to determine if these liquids are safe or if these liquids are not And since we have already discussed that there s probably different qualities for your water versus the water you drink versus the water that you swim in or the water that you are going to take a shower in so when you comment upon whether those liquids are safe or not I think it would probably be a wise decision to comment if you think they re safe to drink versus safe to shower or to swim So I ll start here with cup letter A So you can go ahead and mark A on your paper and then I will walk around so you can just take an observation of the liquid And you determine again if you think that it is safe All right so what do you all think Logan Do you think that this is safe to drink So if I gave this to you right now you d go ahead and drink it because it would be safe No No What would make you change your answer then 
 And one more There s this one spider and he s around all day and then he comes and comes out Oh so it s waiting for him You know i ts like a trap It covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower It sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it it attacks it and eats it Wonderful so they re not really attracted to flowers they re attracted to the insects in order to ambush them Is that what you re telling me Yes Okay all right So and we talked about what is it that attracts these Well we see a lot of bugs we see humming birds and Jack mentioned this word pollen Do you know what pollen is Do you know what pollen is Ah Do you know what pollen is Are these things attracted to the pollen Yes Well not really though No not really Sometimes Sometimes I guess Say that again please It s an ingredient to make honey Pollen is an ingredient to make honey Oh nectar Yeah So bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Nectar Go ahead Jimmy How would you fill this in The bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Go ahead and write your answer in Oh okay I see some people writing pollen You have color They re definitely attracted to their color We have nectar And we have we actually have all of them here So which one is it Is it one of these or all of these All of these All of them All of them tell me more Tell me I think it s pollen and nectar because the nectar s in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff or honey out of it So it s kind of like taking it to its So we say that flowers attract insects so we can connect these two ideas here And we ve talked about their color The insects were attracted because of their color and they re also attracted because of their Nectar Nectar okay let s put nectar right here And they re also attracted because of their good smell No Yeah Yeah No The nectar smells good that s why butterflies go to them Maybe look that up on Google Why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good So bees will go to them Why do people go to trouble to smell good Why not Because it would be gross Say that again Attention You want attention You want to be attractive to other people too Heck no Maybe you re too young for that Yeah when you get older don t you want to attract other people Sure Don t you want other people to find you pleasant Yes You know it s not a big thing but are these fragrances signals to these insects They re attractive right And we ll talk about I agree they are useful but that s not going to fit into my process just yet But all of these things do attract the insects right But what is it that keeps the insects coming back It s sort of like the color the smell you know the maybe the shape of the flower All of these things are like advertisements to the insects Why For the nectar For the nectar It s the nectar that s going to keep them coming back All right you see this bee here What s all this yellow stuff on the bee Pollen Pollen Does the pollen attract the bee No Does the bee want the pollen No Yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive The pollen is definitely important to the flower right Mm hm The bees just spread it around The bees spread it around How many people are aware that bees spread pollen I see just about all your hands go up So the insects are spreading let s put that up here they re going to spread the stuff called pollen Right Of course the insects are really getting what Nectar Yeah so let s put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here right And nectar is another word for what Food You all understand that nectar is their food For the bees For the bees Just the bees No and hummingbirds And insects Us And hummingbirds Us us we have honey Nectar is technically honey So nectar is actually a food for us because we steal it from the bees right Yeah And we hide it from the bears yes Isn t there this one point where it has saliva or something in the bottom of it and it s in the shape of a picture and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything and they get into the water they can t move and everything they re paralyzed Okay it s a trap Yeah Like the venus fly trap Just like the venus fly trap Yeah I don t know what it s called Do venus fly traps have flowers No they have clear white The mouth smells really sweet That s because it catches flies Okay we re going to talk about that in a minute A lot of people when I was reading your paragraphs a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don t have flowers All right but let s look at this thing about pollen for a minute Why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar What s going on here They want them to spread the pollen but why To make more food To make what To make more food You think it s to make more food What do you think Olivia To make like honey The flowers want the bees to make honey No they like need it to make more food Pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make I understand that but why does the flower go to all this trouble Do flowers just like bees No They say hey you re a nice guy We ll make you some To keep them alive I think To keep the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive No I don t know That s okay that s okay What do you think Joe To fertilize other flowers Fertilize What s fertilize You mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground Or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer Different You re calling it a different kind of fertilizer Interesting How many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization How many people have heard that before Hands up here okay So if you want to ask what pollen is you might want to ask what flowers do All right and to answer that I first of all let s make sure this dandelion is this a flower or is this a weed Flower A weed Okay thumbs up or thumbs down Who says it s a weed Okay I see most of you thumbs up a couple of you have sideways or down Next how about this one how many people think it s a flower Okay How many people say it s a weed and a flower Now I see some people who don t know Well let me ask you this If you re to look at this here s a pretty good picture of it what makes you think it s a flower Are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it s a flower Yes I don t think it s a flower That s not my question Are there characteristics about this that make you think it s a flower Yes What would those be The petals The petals Excellent Anything else It s color It s colorful Anything else It has some nectar maybe You think it has nectar Maybe a little bit Have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions Yes Who have seen who have seen Yeah it s very common Well you can actually see bees on top of on top of flowers Here s a close up of the dandelion What do you notice there That looks a lot more ugly It looks ugly Yeah Really No it looks cool It looks like water spouts goin like It does look like water What do you see on the side here Pollen Does that look like pollen What does pollen look like Just tiny balls of stuff Of stuff yeah There those tiny little like they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it s with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower so it stays with them for a while A ball and then it sticks to the bee like if you want to see the bee it s got all the yellow stuff on his leg Yeah we had the picture earlier yeah Yeah I saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body Cool Actually that s the pollen So the pollen so it is picking up pollen So it sounds to me that I guess what I want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers They are Yeah they re definitely flowers Let me show you a picture of a dandelion A little video it s about one minute long and let s go ahead and turn the lights off And as you re watching it just tell me what you observe happening in the video Just go ahead and shout it out The flower is opening it s blossoming Okay this is time lapse so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally but you saw the flower open It s dormant dying now And now it s closing up and it s dying It s going dormant It s dead How many people think it s dead No it s still growing It s dormant It s growing into that white stuff Say that again It s turning into that thing in the ball That s like Marissa s making a prediction It s gonna grow taller No it s going to break up Do you see the insects all over it Every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it Oh yeah Yeah there s one down at the root At the very base of it Yeah something s happening Something s happening It got taller on the screen Oh the bottom petals are starting to die What s that It s starting to look like an onion What s that thing on the top It s going to blow away It s going to grow into a dandelion That was the flower wasn t it That s the thing you blow on What s that They re seeds they re seeds Yeah you blow on them and it s really fun It s reproducing I m hearing Steven say they re seeds And Brandon oh that thing disappeared That whole top blew away That s the stuff that you like to blow How many people think these are seeds I know they are Ah Andrew s thinking So the flower turned into what A seed A reproducer A big seed No they re all little seeds No they re all individual seeds Are they blowing Yes Make a wish Can I have the lights on please So you have Like a month period Yeah that took a while And I think you ve seen dandelions you may not have you ve probably seen the dandelions in two stages Sometimes they re like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white puffy seed pods right You puff on them and they blow in the wind Yeah what does the wind do It blows them away and it starts reproducing So each seed is like a little parachute Yeah And it s dispersed to new lands Yes All right so if I were to say flowers if I were to make a connection between flowers and seeds what would you say about that What will you say What is the connection between flowers and seeds McKenzie They both reproduce They re both related to reproduction Okay uh huh One makes another Okay so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds and there s that word that McKenzie was using reproduce because seeds grow into Flowers Flowers which then Grow into seeds Which then Grow into more plants What does that sound like Life cycles Wonderful wonderful these are life cycles What I m going to ask you to do right now is we re going to look at a seed very very closely I have some you know what these are Lima beans Oh I love lima beans You do really Yeah Oh I don t like lima beans I ve never tried them I like them in my favorite dish chicken pot pie My dad loves lima beans anyway I have some They have been soaking overnight in some water and they re going to look a little bit different because they ve been soaking under water What I want you to do is when you get one I want you to open it up like a book Dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully and I want you to look inside That s what the magnifying glasses are for I want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed Everyone clear Go ahead one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds How many Oh you know what Get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn t work We have a spare Three not unbroken nice plump seeds Take them to your seat I just want you to look at them They re bigger They are bigger aren t they What else are they They re sort of hard They look like mandarin oranges Why s that what makes you think they re like oranges They re not hard anymore They re no what They re not hard anymore They re not hard We grew them last year What s that We grew them last year Oh you grew these last year What do these turn into Farmer s They turn into plants What are we supposed to be looking for Well you tell me Don t break them open Here s how I want you Can I borrow this Okay I want you to go to the round part here and you notice it has like a seed coat Yeah Okay you know kind of peel that back Oh cool And then open it up like a book Okay I m looking at the skin Like this Yeah open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find There s a little surprise there What is this It s a bug It s located yeah Oh gross Mine s already broken so Well you have a good one right here This is perfect Oh I see it Look at that That s a really good one I don t see it Yeah go ahead break it Just like you did I can t open it And oh yours is right here Yours kind of fell apart Do you have another seed Be there in a second Okay Oh there it is right there Do you see that I don t have one Look at it very carefully with the magnifiers What do you have Let me see what you got Yeah right there There s actually part of it right here broke in half and that s attached and there s also a little bit here Perfect look at this Patrick That s what you want to look at I can t open mine See it see it there What do you see I don t see it Oh there is a little bit of green there isn t there Yeah Who else is having trouble Me I already opened mine Yes you did Are they supposed to smell bad Yeah they do kind of smell don t they Yeah they smell Did you see that whole thing right on the tip Look at that under the magnifying glass Okay okay look at my photograph up here Here we go This is kind of what you re looking at You have these two like little half circles little kidney shaped starchy figures but what is this thing right here It s a seed It s starting to sprout What is it It s a start of a lima bean I thought this whole thing right here It s the start of a lima bean plant This is like a plant sprouting out Is that what you re trying to say Steven What s that Is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant Like that like the big parts might be like maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger Like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger Well did you notice there are two parts to it Yeah Yeah it like goes down There is what s this right here It s the sprout Okay I heard you say it looks like a stem Anybody think it looks like anything else Uh huh Go ahead McKenzie Why are these pointing here Why are these pointed It s kind of new That makes sense Looking to break through Break through the The soil And what breaks through the soil What part of the plant breaks through the soil The seed The root Does it look like a root Yeah How many people think it looks a little bit like a root And this looks a little bit like a stem What does this look like to you A flower Let me see it looks like this and there s another one that kind of looks like that What does that look like to you Leaves Leaves What do leaves okay Do you ever see anybody draw pictures Whats that It looks like a carrot It looks like a carrot doesn t it Okay look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier I want you to look for a detail You see a little characteristic Oh I see it I see it What do you see I see like the veins of a leaf Wonderful I don t Oh yeah I do Wonderful you have little veins there on the leaf Yeah you can see 
 They re coming around They re coming around When you have it You re a Grand Old Flag goes under your seats What Do the Stars Do Put them in your hands William why don t you come sit next to Victoria Do you mind Because then you re a little closer Just move a little closer to Jeffrey Stand Reach Stand up Stand up Big breath Oh my goodness Relax Put your hands here Get a diaphragm breath instead of that kind of a breath Here we go big diaphragm breath Ready Breathe in Remember the beginning of the year when you were doing Ready Breathe in Here we go Let it all out Breathe in diaphragm breath Put your hand here Breathe Again Hiss it all out Breath in And you re going to go Ahhhhhhh ready Here we go Breathe in Start up Breathe in Good low diaphragm Relax your shoulders and ahhhhhhh Breathe in Do you see what you re gonna do Instead of hissing out you re gonna go ahhhhhh and let it nice and open and tall Ready Breathe in Ahhhhhhh Big low breath Ready Ready Here we go Okay That s far too sweet We need it to get ugly Let it get ugly and I want a slide I need to hear every single pitch Ready Really try and let that sound vibrate in your forehead Sing it like I want you to zero that sound right at me like you really mean it I know you do Ready Much better Again Get a big breath Again I want to hear every pitch on the One two ready go I love it Do it here Whoo Sit down Take out What Do the Stars Do Please my friends look at part one Big breath This is tricky because we start on a low so It s what do the stars Very very high Make sure you re sitting up with good posture Here we go I am so impressed that you remember so much of that That was beautiful We re gonna do it again We want a really round ooh and I need a little more emotion on Do you feel it Think about it You re singing to the stars How cool is that Right Here we go Not like celebrities either like the actual stars in the sky Here we go Love what I m hearing Is the word do interesting Or do we just kind of seem to hold it forever and it s kind of boring Speak really loudly Christopher what was your idea We could crescendo We could crescendo I think that s a great idea I think it needs some kind of motion So let s put a little crescendo on the word do Ryan what s your question A sforzando We ll try that in a second Let s see We ll choose which one we like better Let s try just a crescendo on do just to keep it interesting So it s Try and do it in one breath If you have to breathe Don t breathe at the same time as your neighbor Stagger Ready Here we go I love the crescendo We have to get it together for up Right Let s try Ryan s idea You want to do a sforzando on do Okay Let s try it Ready So it s That was your idea too Maria Let s try that Ready Here we go You like that You like it Raise a hand for crescendo Quiet A quick quiet hand Raise that quiet hand for crescendo Raise a quiet hand for sforzando Okay Sforzando wins That s what we re gonna do on the word do Love it It s really really pretty Make sure the word do You keep it really nice and open Claire are you sitting on a chair Or are you sitting between Rose and Garrety Just go grab a chair You don t have to squish like that Ready Here we go It s okay I know she came in a little late So that s why she s You looked a little too close for comfort over there Yeah very strong Yes Ready Just Lauren move in a little bit What happens there What happens there on that one It goes one up higher Thank you Rachel Right Can we start right before 11 Pick ups to 11 Ready Here we go What comes next Where are we That s how far we want to get today on that Look at where the clouds where the clouds can fly Notice part three does Is your pitch after the word higher lower or the same as the pitch in part three Higher lower or the same as the pitch as below Are you sure We start on the same So that s how you re gonna know to Yeah Is this gonna be beautiful This is gonna be Sorry I think this is gonna be really beautiful like which one we just did Yeah It has a lot of the same kind of qualities but there s some really rich harmonies and some really rich beautiful opportunities for crescendo and decrescendo and all that kind of stuff Yes The whole song isn t a cappella It s a cappella in parts Yeah It starts out a cappella which means no piano Jeffrey sit up It s a cappella for a little while and then the piano comes in Then it s a cappella again and then the piano comes in and then it ends a cappella So it kind of goes back and forth What we want to get from this for today from this piece is I want to hear your expression I want to hear that crescendo that decrescendo Same thing on the word clouds What do we think What should It s another one of those long notes So we need to do something with it What should we do with it Decrescendo Put a crescendo in it Energize it a little bit Should we try each Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better So the long cloud Two of them We have two of them So let s energize them and then we ll try backing off Let s see Ready I believe that s our pitch Ready Here we go One Two Do we like that Just energize it a little bit That was crescendo Do we want to try backing off Which one do we like better you guys Let s try the decrescendo Ryan question Oh one of each That s what you re thinking Rose So make one crescendo one decrescendo So maybe which one So first one grow second one decrescendo Yeah kind of pulling back a little Posture First one is gonna grow Ready I love it I love it Let s do from the beginning of that piece All right Think about your expression Singing about stars One two three one Beginning So it s and our do What were we gonna do with it I know it s hard when I m by the piano I won t be Ready Here we go Beautiful Beautiful I think that piece is gonna be gorgeous I can t believe it s only your second day on it Yeah You know what The clouds or the clouds can fly had a really beautiful crescendo lovely expression Put that one under your chair and take out You re a Grand Old Flag 
 Let s talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company Let s start with T Shirts R Us Okay who can explain to me what s going on with T Shirts R Us Devon You have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt Okay so you ve got to pay And then what do you pay per shirt Six Six dollars per shirt Okay what are the advantages of that How is this one in some way better than top of the line Allegra what s better about this company You only have to pay six dollars per shirt You only have to pay six dollars per shirt So you re telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt Right Okay what s the disadvantage to this plan Who can tell me the disadvantage to this one Sarah You have to pay 50 dollars first You have to pay 50 dollars up front okay So if I were going to buy a lot of shirts let s say I was going to buy 200 shirts which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts Taylor I think the T Shirts R Us would be better because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt Yeah for this one the more shirts you buy the better deal it becomes right But for this one if you re not going to buy if we were only going to buy for say 10 people would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front Are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference Probably not okay So for top of the line tees our initial charge the nice thing about top of the line what s the advantage of top of the line They re eight dollars That it raise you hand Kevin They re only eight dollars They re already eight dollars but is that their advantage Yes No Patrick says no Patrick is their advantage that they re eight dollars per shirt What s the advantage for top of the line Isn t it because the design is free Is free so do we have to pay anything up front No No so if Cameron if you and I were the only people that wanted to get shirts that would probably be a good place to go right because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars but up here two shirts is going to be expensive right Right Yeah Yeah it would be over 60 dollars right 62 That s not a very good price for shirts okay Brett I kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn t really part of the data Okay Another thing I kind of thought whenever I was working on this last night was if they re charging money for the graphic couldn t it possibly be like a better graphic but It could be It doesn t necessarily mean that it is and I think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable maybe not identical but at least close okay All right So let s look at a couple of different things okay Let s start with these tables You guys have had a minute to look at these tables What the first question says which of the following tables represents T Shirts R Us With this being our given information which one of these tables is T Shirts R Us Tell me how you know Amanda The first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts Okay so Amanda says that this one is T Shirts R Us and how did you know that You explained that in a really interesting way How did you say that Because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts Yeah Amanda says this one has to be T Shirts R Us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars Do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars Yes Okay that s one way to say it Is there another way Lindsay you had something interesting on your paper What s the other way that we can tell whether or not that s T Shirts R Us I divided 30 divided by five equals six Can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five In t shirts there were a five dollar difference The t shirts goes up by five Yeah so this one goes up And the cost up by 30 And I just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars So she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five So then to figure out how much each shirt was she divided the 30 by six and figured out Oh no not by six 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt So one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change right and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost Like what is it that you have to pay up front So in this problem can we see both Can we look at this table and see here s what you have to pay up front and then here s what you have to pay per shirt Can you see that Yes Okay Write that down All right so look at the table and let s talk about the original question that we asked The original question that I asked you and this was just a pick Which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students T Shirts R Us What did you find out when you really really investigated Casey They re both 200 each You really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost 200 dollars 200 dollars So if we were just buying t shirts for our class would it matter which company we chose No No What if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students If we decided we wanted to do all of my math students which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100 Bree what do you think If we were going to buy t shirts for all 100 students because at 25 the cost is the same right Which one of these is going up more quickly The one on the left The one on the left s going up more quickly What do you think Nahla says she disagrees Nahla The one on the right is going up more quickly because it s going up by 40 Yeah this one s going up how much every five shirts 40 Yeah this one s going up 40 and at that same time this one s only going up 30 30 right Bree So Bree which one s going up faster The right one Yeah so they re the same here Do you guys see they re the same here You see that Bree But if this one s going up faster if I m going to buy a whole if I m going to buy a lot more shirts what s going to eventually happen with this one It will increase It s going to get increasingly more expensive okay So somebody summarize this for me What did we just figure out about tables What did we just explain about tables What can you find on tables Sierra tell me what we can find by looking at a table Y intercept We can definitely find the Y intercept Can you tell me how we can find the Y intercept When the X value is zero When the X value is zero that s going to be our Y intercept That was an excellent explanation Guys what else can we find from the graph We can find the Y intercept what else can we find Samantha We can find the slope We can find the slope and can you summarize how we found the slope We found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run Yeah we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run Excellent job okay So that s tables Cameron question Is it okay on the table where it says like t shirts in the columns is it okay to put x and y over them Cameron if that helps you understand it then yes that s completely fine But you need to understand that x and y represent something Right It s okay for you to think about it as x and y but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t shirts and y represents cost okay That s a good question All right now let s look at the graph Okay suppose these two graphs were given to you Okay look at the graph Is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph s set up Does the scale set look the same Yeah The x axis is identical and the y axis is identical So let s talk about the graph for a second Look at the graph Adam can you look at that graph and tell me which thing which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line The one on the right The one on the right Can you tell me why because top of the line keep in mind the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt How did you pick this one to be top of the line Because it started at zero Okay so one of the things that s important was that you realized it started at zero So he looked at this and recognized that my he said starts at zero Okay That s important How else could we figure out that that was how else could we figure that out Allegra I said that since it was five times eight well that s the first coordinate it would be Oh okay so the first coordinate was five 40 so you said five times eight is 40 40 okay what about this one That is 80 10 times eight is 80 Okay is that an interesting way of thinking about it Yes And does that also work Does that make sense with this problem Starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars so she said five times eight 10 times eight and that pattern would work all the way up Is there other ways that I could identify that this is top of the line Amanda I went down there on the table that the rate of the pulse goes up faster Uh Huh so like when you said how Did you guys here the word she used to describe that She said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate Do you guys agree with that The line s more steep Yeah the line has greater steepness is the word you used steep right Yeah so this one not only does it start at zero so we can recognize it that way but we also recognize that it s going up more quickly This one s going up eight dollars each shirt and this one s only going up six dollars each shirt because let s look at the rate of change for this one If we went from zero to five that went over five right And then from 50 up to 80 is what 30 That s from 50 to 80 is 30 30 and so 30 over five gives me how much Six Six per shirt okay Nahla you had your hand up Yeah Go ahead I was gonna say that I understand that it started at 50 So that would be T Shirts R Us So if that was T Shirts R Us then the other one had to be top of the line Guys did you hear what Nahla said Nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50 so because that one started at 50 it had to be what T Shirts R Us T Shirts R Us okay So so what re we talking about We re talking about looking at a graph and finding two things What are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph Greg tell me one Slope We need to do our final slope Emanuel tell me the other one The Y We need to be able to find the slope and the y intercept okay Emanuel can you summarize for me how to find the y intercept How do you look at a graph and find the y intercept Where the line crosses the y axis Where the line crosses the y axis So Sierra told us when we re on our table we re looking for where the x is zero The x is zero but on the graph that means that it crosses the y axis Okay nice Can somebody tell me from a graph how to find slope Stella I haven t heard from you for a minute How do we find slope from a graph You use the slope triangle You use the slope triangle Uh huh Then it leads your eyes for example can we talk about this one It doesn t matter you pick whichever one you d like So it will be the rise and speed it s going up Yeah so this is our rise okay And the run is how far it s going out And the run is how far it s going out It s rise over run And then you write it as a ratio rise to run okay Excellent Guys I have one final question on the graph So we picked these we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right And for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six right Would it matter if I did went too far I think Would it matter if I did that No I heard no Can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that s no So why does it not matter Sydney Because it s the same shape it s just larger It s a similar figure So I guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it it would be the same Did you guys hear what Sydney said Sydney used the word similar or used the phrase similar figures What do similar figures mean What does that mean Greg Like two figures that have the like they re they don t exactly have to be the same size It s like basically a dilation of the other It s essentially a dilation Okay so the first one we did went up 30 over five Right Well what about the red one The red one went from five to 20 How much did it go over if it went from five to 20 Cameron 15 It went over 15 So if this one goes over 15 you sort of used that word dilation right What s the scale factor from five to 15 Positive 3 That s times by positive 3 right So likewise what should this be If my run was 15 what should my rise be Raise your hand if you know Jaylynn 90 It should be 90 Okay so let s check and see if it is So we went from five so that went 15 and then we went from 80 up to 170 Now what s the difference from 80 to 170 80 to what 80 to 170 I don t know That s okay What s the difference Who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170 Sierra 90 The difference is 90 So if I looked at those two ratios so if I looked at those two ratios one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five Are those equal Yep Yes that is let s check it Are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt Yes Yeah so how do we find slope from a graph Taylor said we make the slope triangle and does it matter which triangle you pick Nope No because they should be proportional They should be dilations of one another Okay it be a good reference to something that we learned Can you show us how to start out like the first one Or the first few pages So the question was do you have to start out at the first one No Sydney why no Because if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars then you don t have to Unlike the other one it started at zero Mm hm Are you talking about the final slope Nahla Yes Okay Nahla you can start at the first point but you don t have to because if it s linear should the pattern ever change No So if the pattern never changes does it matter which two points you pick No Any two exact points you pick should still give you the same rate of change That was a great question Okay all right So now this is a different one So on the last one I gave you the verbal Right I did I said T Shirts R Us and gave you the verbal expression This time I m not giving you that This time we ve got a third t shirt company The third t shirt company Tee Time they explain to us this is their function cost Cost is equal to 4 50x plus 25 My question is what does that mean Who can tell me what it means to do 4 5x plus 25 Samantha start me We would charge and 4 50 per each t shirt Okay so what do we have to pay no matter what Patrick what is the one thing we have to pay If we ordered a shirt what s the one thing they re going to charge us For the design They re going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design right But then Each time Huh Each time Well that s a great question Do they charge us 25 dollars every time That s a great great great great great question No why not What s the 25 dollars for It s for the design on every shirt It s for the design and that is the design that we re going to use for all of our shirts So that s an important question Does the y intercept explain anything about change Will the y intercept change Will it move up or down No the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is okay That was a great question Who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like What would the graph look like It looks like a zero but I think it d start at 25 here It would start at 25 So it s go to start somewhere right in here okay And I m not sure why those numbers are on the table but they shouldn t be there Okay but that s okay We can move forward from it We can do this What should the cost be initially 25 The cost should initially be 25 dollars okay Then if we buy five shirts how can we figure that out Who can tell me how to figure that out Ah You can plug in the value of five in the equation thing You can plug into the equation Ooh I know what we can use Oh we can use I heard somebody say this earlier We can use a calculator right Where would I put this information in the calculator Y equals I d go to y equals excellent Okay and I put it in there my function Right so I ve got 4 50x plus 25 And then you press second Yeah what am I trying to look at I m trying to look at my table Let s go back for just a second Look at the table that s already given to us What do they do in their table It increases by five They increase their x values by five So do I want to set mine up to go by fives Yes Yeah so how do didn t I how do I set up a table Where do I do that It s a second and it s on top of a window Yeah it s second and it s on top of a window we ve got a table set up Where do we want to start our table What s the first number we need Five Okay because we already know zero right And then how much do we want to increase each time Five We want to increase each time by fives okay Are we okay with that Now where do I go to actually have the calculator give me the information Sydney where do I go You press second and then you press the graph button Second graph which will give me the table So I will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected because I m going to need you to help me with mine I don t know why I put the wrong table up there Okay we good All right so we used the calculator to help us get our table What was it in fives Who can help me with this Help me with this Cameron real quick 47 5 That s 47 5 or 47 50 right What about tens 70 
 Do you want to measure this separately Or do you want to measure this with the ground water Should we measure this separately Yea cause that s the round rocks Okay what were you saying Cathy Why is the ground water cleaner Because the permeable rocks They clean the water on its way down to the soil saturation There s 100 milliliters and you guys could you record the data real quick Write Ground oh no but we ve got to add this first Yea Wait we ve got to add Is it still But let s do the Is that too much Let s do the answer for number one while we re on it Okay It says Good job Describe what you would do Stop But why is your head right down level with the measurement We re doing that so we can make sure it s exactly even cause if we go over then we won t know exactly how much it is And are you measuring the runoff or the ground water right now Right now we re measuring the runoff It was about 380 It was about 380 Is it okay to get an approximate amount for the volume for this and not an exact amount I think so cause then when we measure this we could still Exactly Ashlyn which had more water Your runoff or your ground water The ground water The ground water had more Yeah Yeah cause they re overflowing Oh my goodness Have you measured your ground water yet Not yet I think you can see it for video Where is your ground water Oh oh I see Oh so this really did overflow Yes So when you measure your ground water what will you need to do with the water that s here in the tray I think put it in with the ground water Yea and measure that too Okay this is your runoff Yes Okay so so far you have how much About 380 And then there s some in here Oh you ve already measured 380 About Oh So that s 100 You are pouring that so carefully Jade Stop Good Because we want to have it exact so I had to Okay Ashlyn So Jade put in 100 once and then she put 100 in a second time So how much water has she put in there so far 200 How did you get 200 Um Be sure you talk nice and loudly honey Because I got it because plus it equals 200 because you put two in there Nice Good job Looks like you re doing great kids 60 Keep going Keep going Looks like it might have been slightly off Better watch it go Okay so maybe if we I think that s good but should we add the should I add the data in now No we needed that did you pour on water because that also Wow looks like we re getting a lot of data Your recharge is high Trial number one why do you say runoff had more water in trial number one I think because it clay s more harder so it s kind of more difficult to go through with So what is this number 790 What is this number 62 And which is greater 790 Yea 790 s greater than 62 Good for you honey How did you get this number dear I think we added them up What did you add up honey 790 and 600 I mean 62 To get this total Yeah Great I have a question for this group though How much water did you pour in on trial one 1 000 1 000 what Milliliters 1 000 milliliters But your total is only 852 milliliters It s still in the zone of saturation Oh Or it hasn t collected off the first Alright But it s interesting maybe the water from last time since we only had 852 ending last time Maybe this time the second sort of Maybe it some might against the window if the water from last time I wonder if it came down in the aquifer I wonder Maybe it s just holding it in there I wonder it ll be interesting to measure this time So what part do you have in your lab note We re adding we re have to answer question two and then we re measuring Describe what you observed when you poured the water over the ground water the second time What changed Taylor you go first Um well I think what changed is since the clay sort of got use to the water the first time and there wasn t very much water on the recharge water the first time and it got used to the clay got used to the water that there are little cracks or the water slipped through the sides and it went and now we ve got more recharge water than we had on our first one Do you think that could happen in real life Do you think we could have an impermeable surface like clay and then it could crack and let water through Why do you think that could happen in real life Some place that might happen for real A bunch of pressure If it rains for like millions and millions of years maybe like cement or gravel It would break it down and it would have like a little Do you remember the term for that Weather rock Yeah Weather rock Like what s in the middle of the road Yeah sure yeah Because when people drive on it it gets so much pressure And people keep driving on it and it cracks sometimes Sure And I m sorry I interrupted you when you were answering question number two I wonder if the I doubt anyone would do this but if we put pollution on clay If you put what honey Pollution on like cement of something I would wonder if it would get through Like sort of like water sometimes and since the clay s impermeable water can t get through it easily but I wonder if pollution would That s a good question you might want to do that experiment when you re done with this one That d be great to check Good job The clay became more permeable the second time we added the water Yes And then we should probably measure how much is in here Yes Oh that s kind of Yea because it s like soapy It is sort of soapy I think it s because of the clay being wet Look on this side Oh yeah I can see some of the white So why is the about 120 Because it s not quite at 150 but it s a little bit over 100 Is close close enough for this Or how do you know when close is close enough for this Um we know when it s close enough for this because it doesn t really have an exact measurement for 120 so we know that it s kind of half way between 150 and 100 little bit lower than 125 There s a lot more recharge than last time A lot more recharge Yeah We had 760 now we have 435 Holy cow The first time you did this you had 760 Milliliters Milliliters of runoff And this time we had 435 milliliters Oh that is a big change I wonder I wonder what will happen with your recharge have you measured that yet Yeah what was it It was I think it was 871 Oh my goodness Why do you think you had so much more recharge the second time you did this Christian Probably because the ground probably got more moist so it would make it easier to slip right through Do you remember the term for that When the ground gets all wet with water Soil saturation Great Well yea I mean the water level must have gotten higher Why do you say that Because the bigger the saturation is and the higher the water table is the more moist the ground is The ground is so the water can go through easier I think the first time we did it the water went through which made it easier for the second time to go through Cause it made it more moist And the rock pebbles were kind of scattered around probably mixed with the water So that s the pattern you re seeing What do you predict will happen on your third trial I m thinking that there will be maybe maybe possibly more recharge than runoff More recharge than runoff Did you have more recharge than runoff the second time No but we always have the tape on and it s less than 100 So they started like this and now they re equal and now you think the third time they ll Yea Oh Because probably since the soil s even more moist now that it will make it go through the cracks And Jasper what did your group discuss that you observed the second time you poured in the water that was different from the first time you poured it in The runoff water was kind of even with the recharge But before you measured it before you were just making your observations and watching what did you observe That the first time that there was there was more runoff because the dirt wasn t that moist Oh Great so that s what you wrote down for your number two And I have a question for you Christian How much water are you the drain person Yeah How much rain did you pour in on trial number one 1 000 milliliters So this is interesting How much did you measure after trial number one 900 So what happened to the rest of the water It stayed into the soil Oh So that s why the soil s all wet Cause there s still water underneath it So it s like How did you get 100 Because 900 plus 100 equals 1 000 Good job Alright I ll leave you to it Four three five would equal Okay we need to have less water than the last time 
 Dan do you have any background knowledge about density Like if someone says It s dense out Yeah Then it would be kinda wet So if something s really like if there was a dense fog yeah it d be So if there was a dense fog what does that mean to you That there s a lot There s a lot of it okay So you re in San Francisco and they re like Hey there s a really dense fog You might expect that there s a lot of fog Alright what would be the opposite of a dense fog A not dense fog No fog or like a really thin fog Okay Jackson do you have any background information Well I thought that isn t it like how close the molecules are together How close the what The molecules are together How closely they are okay Yeah Like say you re trying to go through a screen door And like they aren t really very close together because they res holes Okay And say you re trying to go through a brick wall Okay And they re really close together so it will be harder to go through Would you say then which one would be densest the brick wall or the screen door The brick wall The brick wall and you would say that because Because the molecules are closer together The molecules are closer together Okay anybody else have any ideas about density Yes ma am Isn t it like how compact something is Okay so give me an example Like um don t know how to say this kinda going back to the container thing If we could have luggage and you fill it up so much the luggage case is like so filled up it s so dense Okay so let me take that to the next level So let s pretend we re going on vacation Okay we re going on vacation Raise your hand if you have a place you want to go Or maybe you re going there next week I d be so jealous if you said Hawaii Oh yeah I could be Reese where are you going Or where would you want to go Uuh Mexico You re going to Mexico Well not this break in the in the summer In the summer Alright so let s build this scenario He s got one of those big huge rolling bags that you re gonna put all of your swimsuits in To go to Mexico because you don t need other clothes Flip flops swimsuits and a t shirt and that s it Okay so you got your huge luggage we re gonna pile all this stuff in there I m gonna zip it up What does that have to do with density If it s absolutely packed full what does that mean for the luggage Yeah That the particles are so close together that it s leaving them in Is the volume of the luggage changing if it keeps its shape Or is the mass of the luggage changing because you re adding more stuff to it The mass So you change the mass because the luggage is staying the same Okay your mom says You can only bring one swimsuit one flip flop a pair of flip flops and one t shirt So I take everything out now did I change the volume by it or did I change the mass of the luggage The mass I just changed the amount of matter right So then the luggage with tons of stuff in it we said was what dense or not dense Dense And dense and so the luggage with a little bit of stuff in it was Less dense What changed the density of the luggage What are the other conclusions to what changed the density of the luggage Peter what changed the density of the luggage Less amount Less amount and in science which word do we use Umm Volume or mass on that one Umm mass Less mass less stuff less matter in the luggage Awesome we re gonna do this little scenario with a demonstration so you guys need your clickers it s gonna be an A or a B type answer on this one So get your clicker ready and I m gonna show you a couple of clips Cheese Ooooh Cheese Can we eat it when some people in here don t like it I know well more for me right What What Alright so this is cheese This morning I went to Safeway and I purchased this cheese that is extremely difficult to open And I bought certain kinds of cheese Can I have some Alright So Do we get to eat the cheese You do not Aww dang it Sorry Why can t we eat it So here s your question This is cheese A okay Anybody know what kind of cheese that it is Grayson what s cheese A Umm Swiss Swiss what s your observation that led you to the inference that this is Swiss cheese That is has the little holes in it The little holes in it Okay this is regular old Cheddar Raise your hand Yeah Dan know what it is Cheddar or This is a Cheddar cheese Okay So this is cheese A and this is cheese B I want to know which cheese is denser Okay so with your clicker I m gonna put this up on the screen I want to know cheese A the Swiss cheese or cheese B Are they supposed to be numbers Well it s gonna be an A or a B Right so cheese A or cheese B Alright and if you need to see the cheese again walk around In the meantime I ll put this question up I want to know is cheese A the densest Or is cheese B the densest Okay so this is multiple choice A or B There we go go ahead and click it And let s see what you guys think about which cheese is the densest So the Cheddar is B So A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar That doesn t make a lot of sense A is the Swiss Are we each going to be able to get a piece Please don t talk while we re doing this My clicker isn t working It s not working Which number are you 83 Is it on Yeah Are you pressing the right button Send Oh there it goes Okay good It probably didn t power Alright make sure you clicked in please And then let s look at what we think Okay 92 of you said that the cheddar was the densest So we had another 8 so two people said that this was the densest So here s what I want you to do I want you to pull a partner who s just the person next to you So you guys are gonna be partners you guys are partners you guys are partners and you re gonna be a group of three Partner partner partner Mattie and Grayson and you guys will partner Sydney and Jackson and it s kinda gonna go crossways here So you guys will be a partner You guys are a partner and you guys are a partner Right you re going to turn to your partner tell your partner which cheese you thought was the densest and then I want you to come up with a conclusion that you could say Cheese A was the densest because or Cheese B was the densest because So take 30 seconds to talk Less mass Cheddar So what is the definition of density from here to the cheese Which one is denser the one with more stuff or less stuff More So which of these has more stuff Ooh Nice of you guys and you re not very nice Okay that was 30 seconds Okay choose which person in your group is gonna be Swiss cheese and which person gonna be Cheddar Swiss Cheddar Swiss Cheeses raise your hand please Woo Swiss cheese And I need a conclusion from you so make a statement for me We thought cheese A was the densest because so Erica We thought cheese B was the densest because it didn t have any holes Because it didn t have any holes okay Does anybody have a different explanation why they thought cheese B was the densest Matt Well because cheese A had holes the holes don t take in the part of the technical isn t part of the cheese Okay So So the inside of the holes what are the holes actually made up of Air So there s air in there but it s not part of the cheese So then what s true about the Swiss cheese then Reily It has the less cheese Less cheese compared to its what Compared to has all of it So it s all cheese and this is part cheese What can we say now about their volumes Umm they re pretty much the same Okay so the volume is the same Jackson what can we say about the mass of the Swiss compared to the mass of this guy The Swiss has less mass than the Cheddar cheese So the Swiss has less mass then the Cheddar But they have the same volume can we figure out then which one s the densest Which one s the densest What s both alright You had a chance to talk about it let s vote again Do you think cheese A is the densest or cheese B is the densest After our little discussion Cheese A or cheese B A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar So we want to know who s more dense More dense yep Which one is more dense More dense Is A more dense or is B more dense Let s see if we get an agreement on our inference here about which one s denser Look at that we were able to change two people s minds just through discussion That s pretty awesome I thought it would be eight people Well we went all the way to 100 here So that s good That means that everybody agreed at least in terms of the cheese So as a demonstration What Well I need a snack this is really hard work being a teacher It s hard to be a student That s true Okay ready for demo number two Yeah So cheese number one number two first we need to talk about what sinking floating and suspending means I know it So in order to talk about this I have these fun objects I don t know has anybody stayed up late enough to see David Letterman Yes Oh gosh I lost an animal has anybody on David Letterman ever seen the game show he plays called Will it float Yeah I ve seen it happen Have you Wyatt What does he do Do you know what he does Well I saw it a while ago so I don t relaly remember So you re not really sure Anybody wanna guess what he does on the show He throws stuff in water He takes some stuff then he puts it in water to sees if it floats or not That s pretty much the gist of the game show So I have for your viewing pleasure recreated a game show So I have objects we re gonna play a game called Will it float And the first object you re going to predict this through the clicker Is I wanna know if our little dolphin friend is it going to float okay sink or the third option which is tricky you might not know this word suspend And suspends means hang out kinda in the middle of the water So you have three options alright We re gonna vote on this with the clickers Do you have a question before we do that When you put it to the test can I move forward Absolutely so if you can t see you can either stand up or you can squeeze up into an aisle yeah absolutely Yes sir Which one is it A B or C Oh I m gonna tell you right now okay So we re gonna see if the dolphin floats sinks or suspends And if you can t see when I do it we ll count and you can stand up and watch So A is gonna be sink so do you think it s gonna sink B answer B will be float C will be suspend Okay so sink float suspend which means hang out in the middle of the water Okay so this is an A through C option Okay A sink B float or C suspend Well that was fast Yeah that was really fast So let s see everyone oooo object is going to sink If it sinks what will you observe If it sinks what will you observe How fast It falling into the water Well he s going to fall into the water one way or another but where will he end up On the bottom At the bottom of that okay Some of you one person said that it s gonna float Okay so raise your hand if you re the person who thinks it s gonna float Okay thank you for taking a risk that s okay You don t know yet right it s for fun So if its floating what will that mean what will you observe That s she right When I put this in the water what will it look like when it s floating Like I don t know Will it will be sitting on the bottom No Where will it be located Floating on the Floating right on the top okay And then we had oooooh three whole people said it would suspend right in the middle Raise your hand if you think it s gonna suspend Oh yeah Okay Leia why do you think it s gonna go right in the middle I think it s too light for it to totally sink and I think it s took heavy for it to float so thought it would be right in the middle Okay so you re making the hypothesis it has something to do with its weight Okay alright so that s one idea Too light to stay at the top But too heavy would go to the bottom Is that what you said Okay yes So does suspend mean it stays in the middle Yeah suspend means it literally hangs out right here Yeah Okay that s not true Okay are you guys ready Yes So stand up if you need to be able to see Here s the game show there s a little song that goes with it like Will it float will it float Okay there s my game show you ready Alright it s very suspenseful Can you see Okay here it goes Yes Aww yeah So it sank So go back and have a seat please Now raise your hand if you have any explanation for me why that sank It did sink oh no We ve all been down to the bottom of the pool Why do you think it sank I thought it wasn t flat enough or didn t have enough space enough to float up So now we ve got two different ideas about sinking and foating So Leia brought up the idea of heaviness you brought up the idea of surface area See if I were to put something that has a bigger surface area is it gonna float No Yes Maybe did you tell me that if it had bigger surface on top of the water Okay should we try this Yeah It s gonna sink Oooh Okay so maybe Aaaaw It got swamped Now it floated for a little while right So maybe the shape does have something to do with it and maybe weight has something to do with it Or what it s made out of might have something to do with it So we have all kinds of ideas now about sinking and floating Yes sir Is it because it s denser than water So here s another idea it has something to do with the density of the object It s denser than water So here s a tough question so think about this one What is the difference between how dense something is and how heavy something is If Leia talked about heaviness now we ve got density and now we ve got shape and what it s made of and all these different things so I just want to know this one thing What s the difference between the weight of an object and the density of an object This is a really hard question take a second I want you to rotate back to your partner talk to them about what you think the difference between density and weight is Okay when we talked about number of particles it s later than mass Mass Mass so the relationship between mass compared to the object Okay Okay who spoke last time cause I need a cheddar Oh yeah A cheddar who s willing to talk Emily what did you guys come up with So density is like how much mass or how many particles are in the object And weight is how much gravity is pulling down Okay So would that mean that something That s heavier automatically sink Hang on one sec And then we ll try to work through this one If something is heavier than something else will it automatically sink Are ships heavy Do ships sink Occasionally right Especially if you re on that cruise ship like last week did you hear about that It depends on the Okay now we re talking about depends what it s in So now we ve got all these different ideas working Holy cow Yes ma am anything else to add I was gonna say I don t know why I m just gonna hook on this whole list of things but like a tin can will float if it s empty because of the air that s stuck inside of it holds the object up So if that was hollow I m guessing that it would most likely float So the ships are hollow in the bottom the air that keeps it up but the bottom how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn t hollow That part sinks but the air in the boat will keep it up and that s how things float 
 First are your group activity your group creations Now you all created in your group Sorry You created in your groups eight counts of dance that incorporated in some form or fashion the time step I don t want don t grade right now just look just watch the first one What are you noticing Good right So I was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread or I can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread We re going to keep the white bread for right now Pop push Then this made me laugh Think about this as the heel of the bread I don t get it I m glad to know that you re like I don t get it There s a piece of bread and there s a heel of the bread Oh The butt of the bread Yeah Oh that s why Because you call it the butt of the bread Oh But it s the heel of the bread Ok so not so funny So we have pop push step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread good flap step dig right So today we re going to do pop push step good flap step dig as a review on the right and on the left And then we re going to do pop push flap we re going to add another ingredient flap step dig Okay Flap step dig Now remember this is important why It s the ingredient barely comes up think about it Good flap because when you step flap means that it s two sounds to Boo ya Remember it s two sounds and that s why you say Good flap and to get it up she said real high Alright everybody up spread out Pop push Pop push again is spank kick It s exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board Put your right heel out I need a good pop push Ready and I need a good step As we step what do we do What happens to the body We swing right We sure did pick up that foot Good flap step dig Alright do it one more time Let s do an echo Let me do it I ll do pop push step you do Pop push step I do good flap step dig You do Good flap step dig Right right And I go Okay I go Better Ok by now our muscle memory is either going I got it I ve worked it out or I don t got it and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory So here s what I want you to do Say Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Right foot out Six here you go You take Pop push step Good flap step dig Pop push step Good flap step dig You can do a shuffle Pop push step Good flap step dig You want to Okay Not too bad Look at y all keep on going just like wonderful kids Now let me take a dip What I need you to do real quick bunch up right here Bunch up Do me a favor and bunch up right there Do you body roll Not really Yeah you do No Sure you do Ok well I got it wrong You don t body roll but you will You rock you rock knee right No Come on right hand Flap step dig See you re doing this really well Alright point your leg listen We re going flap step dig Flap step dig Ready And right foot step flap step dig Yes How is this group doing Okay everybody look everybody look Here we go Five six oh you precious thing Are you ready Deep breaths You need your right foot out Six ready and pop push step Good flap step dig Almost left foot Pop push step Left foot good flap step dig Okay let me tell you why You re doing a shuffle We do pop push step lift your foot up good flap step dig on left foot Pop push step Good flap step dig These were all two things Okay body roll Do a body roll Now you can t do a body roll back here Hold my hand Here we go Pop push Step Shift it over Good flap step dig right here Good flap step dig Did you get all this Again the right foot Flex your toes Good flap step dig Good flap step dig bring it in Oh no you gotta body roll Bring it in Good flap step dig That s better And since the problem is your weight distribution it s back here and it s hard to do it like this So you gotta do like this Yeah Okay Alright let me see the middle group Middle group Right foot out Ready oh sorry I got all excited You were ready Six ready and pop push step Yes okay Let s go pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig Ready Right foot And pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig Yes Left foot left foot left foot Six ready and pop push step good flap step dig Almost almost I saw it on the right do it on the left real quick Left foot and pop push push your heel down Base Let me hear some base do it again Pop push step pick up that foot good flap step dig Good flap step dig Left foot good flap come on baby With the lift With the lift Oh sorry my bad my bad to the right Good flap step dig That s it Show some love very nice Alright this group come on Right foot out Six ready and pop push step Oh I got overachievers I love it This time with the hold punched in it Now let me see the hold Six ready and pop push step hold for a second good flag step dig Left foot Pop push step hold for a sec good flap step dig Love it Let s take out the hold Let s take out the hold Pop push step good flap step dig Pop push step good flap step dig Five six right foot ready and Pop push step good flap step dig And ready stop You know what Not so bad Alright this is what we re going to do We re going to move on we re going to move on I want to see pop push FLAP Pop push flap on the right foot Put your right heel out Put your right heel out We re gonna go pop push flap Where s my head Over you Over the front of the body that s right Five six ready and pop push flap Five six ready and pop push flap Yes five six ready and pop push flap Five six ready and pop push flap Not bad Five six last time in push and freeze We re going to take a second piece of bread that heel and go good flap step dig It happens with the left foot Five six ready and good flap step dig You already know that part Isn t that fabulous So we re going to put together pop push flap flap step good Five six right foot goes pop push flap flap step dig Oh Wah Say it for a second Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Say it Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Pop push flap flap step dig Let me see the next move In the shower Be careful you might slip That s a hazard always safety first Yes Okay Andra In Walmart In Walmart really Love it Okay I do mines in Kroger Do you find okay I do mines in the kitchen You do yours in the kitchen Does your mom yell at you No Be careful Like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there all year Okay so Jasline do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class No cause I m quiet Because you re quiet Well number one I m super proud of you for practicing everywhere And do you find that you do it all the time In the store in the school So it s not just something that you re going to do in class You see this And what you re going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go Oh well I continue to do this and I m not even taking tapping I wish I could go find and tap more Okay when that s gonna happen because it is going to happen to you it s like a bug it s like a virus you just get all excited and all that Go to Youtube for me and on Youtube there are lots of how to videos Do you know you could look up how to do this time step on the Youtube video Now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc buck times step No No it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich a different kind of time step So if you re ever curious and you want to continue this through like because you re gonna Do you have to have tap shoes by the way No No What do you have to have Hard floor Tammy sit up for me You what A shoe with a hard bottom Yeah Look I m in heels right That s all you have to do Now one of the things that I wanted to point out to you as we re about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers I want you to look at weight distribution Say weight distribution Weight distribution What is weight distribution Can I use an example Yes Like when we re doing the good flap ball change you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step beat Okay so great Jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back and sit it back down for the step dig Anybody had something to add Shift your weight Yes you re right you shift your weight which way Opposite of which way you switch your knee Oh opposite of which way of whatever foot I m using because if I have this foot up I ve got right Does my body have to turn No No but it kind of does don t it Got some hip action going on right here Alright anybody else see any weight distribution We can do the sink you re kind of down a little bit Okay I was going to say I was trying to get to you The weight distribution doesn t necessarily have to go right to left right Or front to back It can go up and down What is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered So we can move Move To have to have a better base for what Okay so we can keep the rhythm Because if the rate of speed speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it right Tell me how different how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males Anybody know the difference We covered this one Where s the woman s center of gravity In her glut You are absolutely correct In her glut right through here and that s where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers her center of gravity around her belly the baby belly and around Idk Oh Idk alright you don t know So where is the men s center of gravity Where do they tend to Torso Torso Right their diaphragm and that s where we get that spare tire from A man s center of gravity and this is what it means are we here There we are Here s what it means As the woman s center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you re fine and dandy A man if this is him he s going forward He s going to fall He s not going to be able to keep his weight So it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution Yes Let s look really quickly Oh how many of you have taught your significant adult You taught a significant adult and you taught the time step What did you see anybody Sometimes your parents got the rhythm has lost If your parents are a little older than most average parents let s say like 40s to 50s Good good Their rhythm has kind lost it It takes a longer time to teach them They have to be concentrated because they re like Uh uh do that again do that again Okay Jasline that is awesome I m going to put you on hold for a minute because I have heard from you several times Let me hear from somebody new Come on Audrey I found that I really got my skills from my mom My fast learning skills You got your fast learning skills from your mom awesome She learned real fast She picked it up good Alright who else Instead of teaching a significant adult I taught my whole family to tap You taught your whole family Rock on I found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother So why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom I think she slowed down over the years Over the years okay Okay let me hear from somebody up here because I haven t heard anything from up here While I was teaching my mama my daddy got excited and he wanted to so I taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and Right competition And my mama she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time once he got it he could do it over and over again He actually got pretty good like speed wise See Tap is for all ages guys It ll keep you in good health it s something fun it ll keep you active You don t have to learn a certain you know we learned a step and I hate to teach a step but that s the beautiful thing about tapping it s you can come up with all kinds of stuff And you know Hey look here I want you to hear How many of you like step step dancing Oh all around the room Oh we love the step dancing right Step and tap are similar do you see the correlations You re making rhythms there are prescribed movements So we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing You just never know You might have tap groups all around Let s go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick I want you to watch the screen Now what I want you to watch 
 Why do they keep getting colder Why do they keep getting warmer They add water to it Maybe they add water to it Okay what else The thermometer What about the thermometer They could have lights Lights well did they turn off the lights afterwards Okay at this point at that point Maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer Maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it The thing is ultimately are we gonna know what they did Unless I was video taping you during that whole process There are a couple things I wanna point out here in a second I think several of the ideas are possibilities What happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially What do you need to do As soon as you put it in there what do you need to do Do you immediately start taking readings Yes Everybody agrees We immediately start taking readings As soon as we put it down in there like the first second we start taking readings We take a thermometer put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings Like what s the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point Okay so we need a starting point What were you going to say If you put it in there like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature It wouldn t change immediately Yes so it goes 22 21 19 18 It s going down So what could have been the issue here They took it at the very beginning Good good They just didn t wait long enough Look at this one I saw this in one particular group Because by the way you guys realize you were doing some very very different things right As we were doing and collecting this data there were some major differences What could have happened What was going on here Just the obvious stuff Observation what s the difference in the pattern Yes Ma am The hot water is like consistent like it s just gonna stay at the current temp Hot water stays hot Right Cold water is doing what Increasing in temperature It s increasing in temperature The room temperature water is doing what It stays the same With this same group I just happened to catch this Cold water Luke warm water The person was doing this This is the warm water Oh laughs body heat Keeping it warm Insulating it What was happening Transfer of heat We re gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks This doesn t seem like a big deal right I mean would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this You ve gotta start thinking like scientists though Because that could be a huge deal if we re doing something with temperature right Okay good Well the obvious or the observation What s going on with the cold water It s increasing It s increasing okay Luke warm water Staying the same The hot water It s getting cold It s getting cold Okay What s different from the first slide Yes The hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water Did it actually happen to somebody Did it actually happen Yeah Let s do this first Let s go back to here what word would you use to describe what s going on here What s all this heading towards Room temperature It s all headed towards room temperature There s a fancy word that starts with an E We may have talked about this last year The fancy word The idea there s a word I want you to walk away with The word is Equilibrium Okay how does this show equilibrium Rebecca how does this show equilibrium With the hot water how does this show equilibrium Rebecca It s Sierra It all goes toward the same it s kind of like the hot is increasing and it s temperature The hot is what I m sorry I meant the cold The cold is increasing in it s temperature and then it s going towards the room temperature It s going towards room temperature The hot is Decreasing in temperature and it s going towards the room temperature also Is this what we would expect All right so what happened Because I don t have any idea What happened here Yes In some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out So maybe that one cup was under a lot of air We do have some powerful air vents What do you guys think Is that that s a huge amount Any other ideas Yeah I think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature down for a hot cup Is it possible there s human error here And they just they looked at the wrong thing Maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot So there s mixing the water thermometers maybe just read them wrong So you guys think some kind of human error then Yes Yes Let s go back to this and let s go to the next step Kind of like what we ve done in the past I want you to think of this at an atomic level a molecular level what s happening here In order to do that we re gonna play with BBs I ve got enough sets of BBs here each group is gonna have a set of BBs All right So group up a little closer together Alright so you two maybe go around you guys Here s what I want you to do Within your group one half have one set Actually the two of you can Marcus Good here s what I want you to do The BBs will be what Atoms Atoms and molecules Okay are atoms and molecules just sitting No When we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower Faster When we take away energy they re going to Go slower Or rather than take away when they release it I m gonna give you a couple minutes I want you to talk within your groups I want you to be able to do three things I m gonna call people up here in a second I m gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your BBs I want you to be able to simulate the top line the middle line and the bottom line So getting cooler room temperature staying the same and getting warmer I also want kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium All right talk to each other real quick Some are getting cooler Some are getting hotter Some are staying the same temperature and how would you show equilibrium I ll give you about a minute or two All right everybody Take a look at your BBs Hands off BBs I got a volunteer What were the BBs again Atoms Atoms And we re trying to show what Movement towards equilibrium Movement towards equilibrium What Energy energy and movement how those go together Energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it Okay everyone take a look at the chart Here s the graph Show me the top line And tell me what you re doing Make it faster because it s hotter It decreased because it s going down and getting less heat Okay so it s gonna start the BBs are going to start going fast and then Slowing down Slowing down Could you show us Yeah we re in an awkward spot Getting warmer the bottom part of that chart At first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it s getting warmer Thank you I m gonna do room temperature I think room temperature would be this and it stays the same Kenny what Well it s gotta be moving right Room temperature would just be this and I have to do what Oh I probably should have picked the same group The two of you working together how could you show us equilibrium Of going towards equilibrium She s going to do cold Okay and you re going to do hot Okay good now time out What did you do Or were you not done I started out fast and she started out slow Why did you start out fast Because I was hot And you were Cold Cold And Lauren what did you do The same speed which was getting close to equilibrium Show us one more time Good Who disagrees Nobody Good Thank you Here we go keep going A couple more things real fast Most of you guys had this going about six seven eight nine anywhere from six seven to 15 minutes of data If we did this for an hour what would this look like They would eventually all be on the same line for a while And it would be pretty boring So this would keep going well what would be the lowest point Room temperature This would be the highest point Then this would still continue the same What s the word Equilibrium Here s how all this started This whole lab that you guys put together and created It s a demo Here s how it all started I asked you a question yesterday a couple days ago Jar bag with some water in it scarf although I told you gloves and then aluminum foil We came up we felt all four of these things And you made a predic Well the question was If we put these outside left them there overnight you look outside your window 
 Has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees Why do you think it s more light around him I don t know Just to show that to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture What is the dark force symbolizing Why is it a dark force Why isn t it like a bright light Yeah I don t know It kind of reminds me of what Jack said Dante started going through the forest It kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff Hell s not a very bright place so it reminds me of that One thing the light and religious paintings Jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he s pure or more religious But What d you say I said but Dante isn t pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn t as pure as like Jesus Okay so I want to come your statement in a moment because Kailyn had something to offer Why do you say he s not pure Is there any indication that he s not pure Well it s kind of an inference because he s man We all assume that the purity is in God or Jesus or Buddha or whatever He s not because he s man and men have faults Women have faults A human being is just not divine I guess But it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously So he kind of is the most pure one Not like Godlike but he is more pure than the rest I believe So do you think that s why Dante went to hell in the first place To go see all the bad people Do you think he was going there to learn a lesson Or going there to prove that he was right Because remember this is a fictional This is fictional So can a character cause you re right we infer that man is sinful But can a fictional character be perfect Can be flawless Can be sinless And if so is Dante trying to go a different way of inference Is he trying to infer that he is from what you ve said that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he s not already So can a fictional character be pure One of the questions I think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent I kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything Like a wake up call You re going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways They were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing He was considered a fraud by the other team I guess side So I think it s more of a like he s going to there to see what happens when you don t be the best you could be I guess Who judges where you go Is it the devil or is it a higher power I thought it was the gods that judged that Are there gods in this story Do we ever hear much about the gods We aren t sure about the gods Yeah really Who judges where all these people go Cause they re talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that We didn t really read the hell part as opposed to the Yeah yeah So maybe in the other books it would explain Where the gods are And you said who judges where they go and everything Technically we don t know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating Brutus Cassius and Judas But in the book on page 41 lines 8 9 Minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go So he s kind of like boss of hell sort of Forty one lines eight and nine I have a question Are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something Because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell That s what I find too Meaningful But in their own perspective they are different Individual yeah So do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far What do you think depends on how far you go down Like the pain increases One of my questions are are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do I think it s what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are I think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes Couldn t it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life For instance in Limbo All these babies that had died and weren t baptized are now there but they hadn t really hurt anybody so they re not being quite as punished as let s say Judas who s in the center of hell having his head gnawed on He caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done So it depends on who they put it on Yeah So if they just keep it to themselves Like gouging out the eyes That s not really hurting anyone else Right Where s the gouging of the eyes Where did you just pull that from What piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out Oh I m sorry I got confused Oedipus Oedipus He punished himself for it in a weird way But do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn t torture other people Think before you respond Think about it because I want you to respond to this This is huge I want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we re going to do for the end of the year Okay So write down your question Mainly she has brought up just like I heard you guys doing with these pictures a different text Didn t you bring up the Odyssey with this Yeah Do you want me to write Oedipus specifically Yep write down the gouging of Oedipus eyes Where would Oedipus have ended up in Dante s Inferno Okay so pretty much Yep And I want you guys to answer and then I ll move on and come back I love how you bring in another text That s one reason I brought this picture in so you guys hit on that I love that you brought this up This is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we ve read and you have to develop a theme so right there s a good start Okay you ready for them to answer it Yeah Okay The pain that Oedipus caused wasn t intentional So I don t really think he d be punished as harshly I do believe that he d be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and I believe a couple other people during that fight So he would be punished but I don t believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment Cause really he didn t knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally So really he shouldn t be punished for something that he didn t know he was doing But he still killed somebody He did kill somebody And the gouging of his eyes I don t think would lessen that I think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him Although It did cause him a lot of pain I believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes May I clarify something really quick here So you re saying basically because she asked where in hell would he be So f irst of all what level do you think he d be Gouging eyes or not where would he be in hell Where would Dante run into him He would be with the murderers With the murderers okay So you re saying that he wouldn t be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging No That is just his own Retribution Yeah He did that to lessen the guilt in his life In himself Cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes And also even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with like suicides Right Cause there s the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell Or they destroy their possessions I didn t quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had I don t know maybe a couch or something If you destroyed that you d go to hell because they destroyed their own items Right right In Circle Nine and that s what important about this in Circle Nine those people that destroyed or take from You know you have Canna after Cain Everything is allegorical Every part of Circle Nine there s an allegory There s Ptolemy there s Cain Everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins Because of what they did to humanity Like Ptolemy murdered people in his In his He was a ruler He just murdered people Mass murders So he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin That Hitler type of sin So everybody in that level too Which would be interesting to see Talk about some of our other literature Talk about The Odyssey a little more I have one more question about sin Do you think is everyone s definition of sinning the same Actually I don t believe so We were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in Limbo Goes along with what he said was no I didn t steal so you stole and then you lied Yeah So you double dipped So you half and did different things Oh interesting so what d you come to We came to they d go to the serious one Yeah Whichever one s more serious Why Basically the one thing that impacted the world more like in a bad way is going to take the worse punishment So if I stole a penny or I lied to the king I d probably get punished for lying to the king That s what we kind of came up with Yeah So I want to ask you a question If you re saying you lied and then you lie about lying or you steal and you lie about lying I don t steal sorry Yeah they re two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes Okay so does that play into that Would you suffer twice the punishment then No it doesn t bring up any of that in Dante s Basically everybody s got the same punishment But still wouldn t you get like harsher Well depending on the circle Yeah but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people Will you give me an example Well let s see Ulysses and I forget the other guy s name they are in the same flame and I think he said the flame was burning brighter I would assume that d be a worse punishment than other people if they re burning If they re burning yeah Some of the less worse um lesser punishments It s like magicians get their heads turned backwards You could see where you ve been but you wouldn t cry over it Unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again Yeah Then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again Yeah Yeah I want to ask you guys a question because we ve studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying Oedipus And I don t know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together but there is what is her name Antigone s brother s name that was dead Polynices Yeah Polynices Was it the one where she was like leaning over his body Yeah by the rock Yeah Okay now that you ve read The Inferno do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur I can relate Okay talk to me about that Because it reminds me of Dante being lost in the forest in the beginning and then it reminds me of how Oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn t see anything and so he didn t know which path to take He had to rely on somebody else He had to rely on Virgil to get him through what was to come Then Oedipus he had to rely on Antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically Nice Nice That s what I got Well as I walk away I want you guys cause I m going to leave this here I want you guys to talk about other literature Cause you said yes I can relate some You just did I would like for you to relate All right Okay Okay 
 All the water goes into the jeans and this water dripped out the bottom Mmhm So it ll drip out the bottom as it dries and go into the ground Okay Other ideas about A Other ideas about A Okay How about B It disappeared It no longer exists It s gone forever Maybe not forever but it s gone Anybody choose B No choosers for B Okay how about C It s in the air in an invisible form Kyle I think it s evaporated into a gas and you can t see it It evaporated into a gas and you can t see it Okay other ideas about C I just have similar to Kyle s but water vapor you can t usually see it Okay so it became water vapor which you can t see Alright How about D it moved up to the clouds Lots of Ds How about Mina What do you think Well I think it evaporated and then it went up so It evaporated and went up And when things evaporate they form clouds Mm no Okay So who Can you explain your ideas Well it was like actually it did go into the clouds because the water s still wet so Okay so when it evaporates it goes to clouds Alright Other ideas about D Moving to the clouds Luke I do think that it turned into water vapor Okay But I think that maybe clouds are there and then it gets soaked up by clouds sort of Okay So okay Let s talk about some of these ideas So I m hearing the word evaporate from a couple different people What does that mean to evaporate What are your ideas about that Emmie Doesn t it mean to like when the water gets at a certain temperature it turns into a gas Okay so when water gets to a certain temperature it changes to a gas Other ideas about evaporate or what that means When it changes to a gas what s happening Ideas about that Mitch Well maybe it first comes out of the machine maybe the sun could make it heat a lot and sort of the bubble question like maybe it could be a heat bubble under each town Not be an actual bubble but go up to the water cycle and then go come back down Okay so when you say go up to the water cycle what happens to it It s evaporated up It s evaporated And where is it when it evaporates In the clouds In the clouds Okay other ideas Jake Well when it evaporates the way it works is the heat makes it so the atoms get go farther apart and that makes it change into the state of gas Okay the atoms go farther apart So is it still water Yes but in a different form Okay Okay Other ideas about evaporation And how about clouds So some people are saying when it evaporates it turns into a cloud What is a cloud Ethan share I think it s like a gas Okay But then I think when it evaporates and goes up to the cloud and then I think it will be turned into rain I agree Yeah So first it s a gas when it s a cloud and then it turns back to rain Uh huh Okay Jamie other ideas I think a cloud is like water turning into mist and it gathers in the cloud So when it gets dark it builds up with more water and then when it rains all the the cloud gets too heavy with water and then it rains Okay so it s a mist Yeah Is it a liquid or a gas A liquid slash a liquid slash gas Okay a little of both Okay Okay alright Let s move on How about E It changed into a new substance No takers for E new substance Okay How about F it went to the sun It went up to the sun No takers for F either There s a lot of hands I m not seeing up How about G It broke down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen Alex I said that because well it goes up into the sky and it must be really humid because it like I can t remember is it when the atoms separate or and because we re humidity ing it Yeah Okay so it becomes more humid and that makes the atoms separate Is that what you re saying Well not exactly It s hard to find the words Okay Can you try It separates and that s what makes it humid Well I don t know I guess I ll come back to you Keep thinking about it How could you explain your ideas Joey what are your ideas I can I go off of Alex Yeah Oh so when hot air rises so when the water gets to a certain temperature I forgot who said that but it the atoms spread apart and change into a gas And it would be more humid because hot air rises and the gas rises into the clouds Okay so as the hot air rises the gas rises with it Is that what you re saying Mmhm Okay And the water becomes hydrogen and oxygen as it goes up Mmhm Okay Other ideas Dylan Well so there s oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere and the atmosphere is gas and gas doesn t sit at the bottom It s in the air which means it s obviously floating I guess And so if water turns into vapor which I think most of us know and vapor can float and obviously it s turning into a gas like oxygen and hydrogen And so how would water be able to float if it s turning into gases it s breaking down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen It s still almost like a liquid gas but if it wasn t a gas that consists of things like hydrogen and oxygen how would it be able to float How would it be able to turn to clouds Okay so it can t be water still if it s going to be floating around in the air Well yeah Is that what you re saying It s still water but it s in a different form that it has components that make up it s pretty much a liquid gas almost It s a liquid gas Yes yeah Which makes it float in the air Well yeah gas Gas can float and hydrogen and oxygen Okay So it becomes hydrogen and oxygen in the air Well as it heats up then it breaks because as it heats up then it creates vapor Water evaporates and so as it heats up when it gets to that point then it breaks down into atoms and everything else Okay when it gets to the air Yeah when it turns into vapor Okay when it turns into vapor that s when it becomes hydrogen Because yeah that s how it when the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen break down I m guessing that that means that that s when it s turning into vapor Okay Okay okay great Luke other ideas I think it might become the combination of the two because I think more than just one because I think it does split into different atoms which makes it a gas And then um and then also it could go into the clouds or something like in other parts of the answer Okay so maybe it turns into this hydrogen and oxygen gas but then goes to the clouds Yeah because I think that that s kind of the only way to go to the clouds and I think its probable that it would so Okay Okay okay Lots of different ideas We re going to move on so that we can get to the others How could we observe this What could we do to know if some of these options are the right option or be able to eliminate them as possible options What could we do Turn and talk to your partner quickly What could we observe And see what happens Okay Would we be able to eliminate any of these if we agreed with Owen s suggestion Eliminate F How come Because the sun s very far away Okay And it s really really hot so Okay if we did it in the classroom would it be able to get to the sun No it d be stuck in the classroom right Okay Are there others that we might be able to eliminate if we did that Good Okay let s hear your ideas What could we do How could we observe this scenario Trenton I haven t heard from you today Okay so to eliminate some of them if soaked into the ground you could check if the ground was wet or anything and it moved up to the clouds You could check if there s any clouds Okay See if a cloud forms Okay Miley other ideas I agree with Trenton but I think I ve seen them where the area s curved over like our roof and the sun is out you can see mist kind of stuff coming out And I think if we did that then maybe we could observe something that could be useful Okay what would we have to do though to set this up What do we need Owen You can wet a paper towel and then hang it from somewhere and then heat it by a light and then or you could have a fan Okay heat it with a light or a fan So perfect I like your idea So we have a cloth It s wet Is it wet Kind of Kind of It s not wet enough Should we make it a little more wet Yeah Okay let me make it a little more wet That better Yeah Okay And in this scenario this is hanging outside right Well we re going to hang it in our classroom And since we don t have a lot of sun today we re going to make our own light energy with this lamp So don t look at the lightbulb because it s real bright There we go And we re going to set it up here So as we watch this which one of these or which ones might we be able to eliminate So as we observe what can we how will we know which ones are true or not true Let me give you a minute to think I want to hear from someone new I haven t heard from yet Who haven t I heard from yet Augustine A because I wasn t sure if the ground was wet or dry Perfect yeah It can t soak into the ground right So we ll see if the counter is wet if there s a puddle there then we ll know that A is the correct answer Excellent Others that we might be able to eliminate just by observing Jake B it disappears and no longer exists because nothing can t disappear Something can t disappear unless it goes into a black hole Okay will we be able to observe that though No Not really yeah So that one might be tricky but that s good prior knowledge Jamie others that we might be able to eliminate We can tell if it moved up to the clouds because there s no way it can move up to the clouds because there s a ceiling Yeah there s a ceiling Well so if we saw a cloud forming in our classroom right then we d know that it makes a cloud But if we don t see a cloud then we ll know that we can eliminate that one That one s wrong Good Others that we can eliminate Miley F it went up to the sun because it can t we don t have a sun in the classroom If we saw it right gathering up the light right that might tell us that maybe F is true But it can t get to the sun because it s stuck in our classroom Good Any others that we might be able to eliminate Emmie We might be able to well C because if the cloud isn t wet anymore and you can t see anything or feel anything we would know that that s true Okay okay So if it disappears we can t see it or feel it in the cloth but we can t see it anywhere else maybe we ll know that C is more likely Okay good Very good Excellent So we re going to keep observing for these things Those are the things that we want to keep an eye out look for a cloud forming look for water puddling at the bottom look for water gathering at the light See if it chemically changed into a new substance we might be able to see it right in our classroom somewhere So we ll be observing for that Is it going to happen immediately No No so we ll have to come back to this one Keep looking back as we go In the meantime uh oh No here we go We ll go to the next one next scenario What s in the bubbles So turn to that scenario in your notebook if you re not there right now What s in the bubbles So Hannah is boiling water in a glass teakettle She notices bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle that rise to the top and wonders What is in the bubbles She asks her family what they think This is what they say So who agrees with Dad Who may agree with Dad Owen Well since it s being heated and being heated from the bottom the bubbles will form on the bottom as heat and then the heat would make it rise to the top Okay the heat makes it rise to the top Good Other ideas Other people who agree with Dad Mitch Well I agree with Dad and Calvin Okay And for Dad if the bubbles are heat maybe the heat forms the bubbles and then the oxygen in the bubbles makes it float to the top Okay okay So let s move on to Calvin then Other thoughts about Calvin Who agrees the bubbles are filled with air Reed I forgot Okay we ll come back to you Anybody else agree with Calvin Anyone I haven t heard from yet today No Trenton anything for you to contribute Well I didn t at first and I don t really know if I do still but like I kind of do because with the water all water has oxygen in it which is kind of like air and then the air could be in the bubbles because the bubbles would probably heat up and be at the bottom and then the air would fill up from the water and go into the bubbles and then Okay so there s air in the water and as it heats up it comes out of the water Okay other ideas Miley I agree with Trenton and Mitch because they could be both filled with air but they could be hot because it s where the source of heat is Okay alright Reed did you remember Yes Okay go ahead Well the heat can take the air out of the water The heat would take the air out of the water like Trenton was saying And since air s lighter than water it would rise to the top It goes to the top Okay good How about Grandma The bubbles are an invisible form of water Anyone agree with Grandma Rupo I said I believe with Grandma because I thought that they d go up to the top I thought it was just invisible because I thought it was just going up and the cloud s just evaporating higher and higher Okay so there are the bubbles are evaporated water And then go away Okay Matthew Well it had to be a form of water because it came from water I guess and they re invisible so yeah Okay so it had to be water because it s coming from water and you can t see it so it s invisible Uh huh Great How about Mom The bubbles are empty there s nothing inside them Who agrees with Mom Who agrees with Mom Jonathan I think that there s nothing inside the bubbles because how could anything get in the bubbles in the first place How could that turn into bubbles Okay how could anything be in there Where would it have come from Yeah Okay Anybody else agree with Mom Anybody else agree with Mom Okay how about Lucy The bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen that separated from the water Lots of hands Who haven t I heard from today Jodie Well I don t really know why because it just sounded more scientific Sounds more scientific Okay Any other reasons No No Alright Kyle can you add on to that I think in the water when it s not hot that there s oxygen and hydrogen and other things in it and then when it heats up it forms into I don t know It rises up Okay so where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from I think it s part of the water It s part of the water Okay Good Emmie Well I know that I m pretty sure water is made of two oxygen molecules and one hydrogen molecule Opposite Oh other way around Yup two hydrogens and one oxygen You re right Okay and I m with Lucy because bubbles usually kind of probably form by the water and inside and since the water s the molecules that that s what s happening Okay so water 
 Let s go Okay Continue Yes All right scholars here s my question What do you think actually let me start by quoting the passage So it says they can either trust or predict what Chacko s attitude would be and they were trying to hide that get rid of it all before Chacko returned So what do you think Chacko s opinion of all of this chaos would be Could you just be particular with the chaos you were talking about What s that The entire situation the steamy love affair and the reaction on Baby Kochamma s part And Mammachi s part Got it I don t think he d be happy about the love affair cause as it says it s like she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one blessed personally by the Patriarch of Antioch Antioch an imperial entomologist and Rhodes Scholar from Oxford so it s like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long and just thrown it out the window I m gonna have to disagree with that Becca I mean I think that Chacko is a liberal type He is very progressive he s a Marxist he didn t allow his father to beat his mother as most Indians Traditionalists probably would be OK with I think that Chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if some guy was having an affair with his sister As a social ideal I think he would be fine with everything I agree because I feel like oh God I had this whole plan of something to say and I can t remember Sorry No it s not your fault Well what is the only thing that made Chacko upset at Mammachi Was it that she abandoned her children Oh I got it Yeah I feel like the most of this passage though it s third person narration it really feels like it s coming out of Baby Kochamma s mouth and it s like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff The whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black To quote the passage once again So I feel like that all really Baby Kochamma s words and not necessarily Baba s beliefs and I feel like they have really contrasted beliefs Yeah I mean I feel like all the diction you were talking about for instance when it says Mammachi s rage at the old one eyed Paravan standing in the rain drunk dribbling and covered in mud And it repeats mud a lot and I think it s that s just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they re trying and almost like mud covers things up So it s almost like it should be covered up And they were trying to cover it up But don t you feel like they used Chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do Oh he s coming back so we have to do this They kind of use him as the excuse to do it Well it s sort of like Chacko could intervene and so we have to do it now so we can t miss our chance to do it again I think that s important actually I think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here It wasn t their fault when the whole thing spun like a deranged top I think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie In the movie for example when Mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if Kayani gets married but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around I think that s this book and movie is really trying to say is this is what happens when you set up rules and don t adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change I ll just go In the fourth paragraph they talk about having a plan It s very orderly and they said that Kochu Maria was a midget lieutenant They had this very organized and planned out even though in the second paragraph she shuddered with a school girl shudder It s like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff Yeah on that I really want to say cause it says school girl shudder at the beginning And then it back in the fourth paragraph when it s talking about their plan they re referred to as the two old ladies So that s contrasting in a way to be described which obviously it s important Yeah I think that s one of the themes of the passage Conflicts between age and which one is ultimately I don t want to say better but a better advantage I guess Like in authority Between age and youth you mean Between old and young Yeah age and youth Which one can have a better life according to them They also play with age When they locked Ammu up it s kind of like putting her in time out like they tricked her in to her room which is also a parallel I saw in the movie when they locked Kalyani up so she couldn t get married It was to keep them from doing stuff I just want to bring up another theme of the passage Where it s the very beginning where it s before we are completely ruined by the It kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs what you do In this society at least affects everybody around you And it kind of contrasts Ammu s individualism with what societal hierarchy and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy so they have authority over her and so they re telling her not to do this And they re presenting their authority over her And Chacko s even higher than them just cause he s a guy When the passage lists the life cycle events the weddings the funerals baptisms and birthday parties it says for generations to come so I feel like what Peter was saying it affects all of society That also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people The funerals are when you die The baptisms are when you are just born So it s saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life that s how profound it is And even that sentence that Peter was talking about before it goes any further Before we are completely ruined I think that s also just family selfishness because they re just projecting what her the consequences of her actions will be for them Not necessarily for her And in the movie where the leader of that house of she s just really concerned about herself She ll sacrifice all of the other women just so she s comfortable But does she also use a we I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti say the same thing We re gonna be ruined by this We we we In regards to that I think In water you know how all the widows they sorta put them together and they sort of create this unity It s all out of despair because they all lost something In a sense Mammachi lost her former love and so did Ammu Ammu had babies without It wasn t a formal tradition The way she had her babies And so in a sense she has She s in grievance and so those two aspects unites these women Yeah they re all widows Yeah they re all widows and that really But does that give them right to be Oh understand that s why I feel like it says we Not we like our family but more of like we women who are widowed Austin what do you think Do you think that gives them the right to because they ve also lost and because Baby Kochamma and Mammachi has also experienced trauma so that also means Diti as well Her husband died when she was young Does that give them the right to take that I don t think so cause that was actually one of my questions Especially when it says Her tolerance immense needs as far as her son was concerned became the fuel for unimaginable fury at her daughter And then just my question was is Baby Kochamma s actions motivated by Indian society or her own emotions So I don t think that they should be able to from their past experience take it out on everybody else I think that what we re talking about right now maybe be reason that Ghandi appears at the end of the film Because Ghandi as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism And it s when he shows up nice Diti sees that may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain Ghandi s existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women I think that Ghandi in the movie represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once Ghandi takes power The widows will gain power The untouchables won t be untouchable anymore They ll gain more rights So I think they look at him as not really rationalism because some people think that he s just crazy The Brahmin caste don t see him as rational so I think it s more of a hope in an idealized society Building off of what she said how Ghandi represents re birth I think coincides with the movie s title Water For me at least the way I saw it I felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie They washed themselves it was washing away their sins Being reborn I thought who s the girl The one who killed herself Kalyani I thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself Because the way she was killing herself she was submersing herself in water and I thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff she in a sense she was clearing away her sins And so she would go to the next life sinless I think that the drowning of Kalyani parallels to how Sophie Mol drowned How it s like the innocent life was taken by the water Which isn t really innocence too But was Kalyani innocent I think that if she hadn t been forced to do things she would have been she didn t feel right about what she had done I m gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way in both the movie and the book It says the fisherman had already found Sophie Mol She They drowned trying to cross the river and Kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who Norian really is The river is important in both works It s an inescapable wall So I don t think water is portrayed as a good image I mean it could possibly be both I think Peter made a pretty good point about it Sam did with Kalyani s death and Sophie Mol s death But I think it could be both I think it s a duality thing And then going on combining what both ya ll said where you said it s an inescapably and the way they view it as washing away their sins View it as a cleansing thing also for example emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs And they re cleaning themself in this if water is just viewed a symbol they re cleaning themselves with something that s bad I also don t think that They depend on the water too to get their food from it They wash themselves in it Yet it s also it creates this it s something that the Paravans are trying to overcome A lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier but they depend on it They still need it So it s contrasting what they believe Just like a duality thing Yeah It s the family and God s talkings Their immediate family They depend on each other because when you re a child you have to have an older figure to help you grow up But they are also They cause the turmoil with each other They create their own problems pretty much It s like you can t live with them but you can t live without them Susan did you have a question Yes I did Well a lot of them are about similarities between characters But one thing that I thought about was how Norian dealt with his lover s loss and how Velutha was able to deal with being separated from Ammu And do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations Sorry I missed all this So she I heard Well Norian because he was a Brahmin the highest caste I think he said we ll either going to Calcutta or India to start his life You mean Kolkata Or I m sorry or England To become a lawyer So he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education and he could provide for himself Velutha was an untouchable so he had no opportunity 
 tilted towards the Sun you re closer to the sun which is heat which means you re going to be warmer When you re tilted away from the Sun then there s less heat because you re farther away from it it s going to be colder That s what changes the seasons Once again it goes in orbit Like you said the closer we are to the Sun or the father away once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit I think that tilt causes the seasons and the closer we are tilted to the Sun that means it s like Summer or Spring then if we re tilted back it s Winter or Fall I m kind of understanding what you guys are saying Because I m thinking of it as like say like the globe that s sitting right there say that Ben was the sun You can use that if you d like Say that Ben was the Sun the Sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe because the globe s tilted So there wouldn t be much Sun at the top of the sphere because that s the most tilted away from the Sun So it would cause Summer lower and on the other side it would cause Winter Why are you shaking your head I disagree I think the Sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom because like Antarctica and stuff always cold and it s at the bottom So I think it hits more in the top and in between like by the equator Because as you go down South it s more warmer but still if you go down way down to Antarctica it s totally freezing they don t get no sun That s not right Because there is like sunlight in Antarctica and stuff It s just cause like the latitude and longitude and like because Because Antarctica s at zero degrees So it s cold down there I want to know when the Sun is going in its orbit if it just goes from this to this like boom or if its turning and its like facing the Sun like that like I don t understand that Okay So our question is what Like when you re going around the Sun and its on its axis like this tilted and it goes around eventu Does it just like go like that Like real quick And then it s like shifted so the bottom is getting more light and that would put us in Winter What do you think Kaylie You haven t said anything Do you think that our our tilt s going to just change No I think it s like whenever we re rotating like it goes around the Sun in the orbit Can I show She s saying that as it s rotating it s staying the same it s just that it s changing because you re changing position from which way the Sun is Can I show an example with the globe Yeah please Say the Sun was in the middle Say like the globe is right here Say we re right here it s Summertime really close and the Sun s right here And as we go around like maybe like we re right here and this is Fall and then we go to Winter And as we turn this way for the Spring and then we re back to Summer again because we re going around the sun so But the only problem with that is we re still going to be tilted away when it when we go over towards the Sun We re still going to be tilted away won t we Well the Earth s always tilted Yeah but we ll be tilted away In the Summer you re tilted towards the Sun Let s go back to does the tilt change Okay so we re definitely talking about this tilt and I m guessing there s a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt Yes So if you think you understand the tilt help everybody else understand We re not getting this tilt in what you re talking about So explain it the best way you can and help each other okay so I don t get this tilt Does it just flip flop What do you think Anna I think it stays the same What about you Shana You haven t said anything yet Well as the Earth goes around in its orbit it shifts just like a little bit that way you re like closer to the Sun And then during the Winter we re father away Is that how it is We re closer towards the Sun in the Summer and we re father away in the Winter Yes Who doesn t think that Could I try something with the globe real quick Yes Could I borrow Nick to be my Sun Yeah Be his Sun Nick Come on Sun Go out there and stand in the middle Pretty dark Sun Yeah you are Okay we re gonna say that this little pin here is where the Sun is hitting today All right And we re spinning woah spinning that way It s spinning it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning but it never it never tilts back towards the Sun That s what I don t understand does it just go like this This is a really good question This is a really good question Now I want wait don t move yet I want go ahead be the Sun still And I want you to walk around and explain to people what you re talking about Number one show us the tilt Okay that s the tilt Show everybody the tilt Okay everyone this Nick move you re in the way of people Just duck down just crouch And this is the way of the tilt the way it s tilted that way But as we go around it s still tilted that way And this side here is still far away so what It s going to stay Winter all the time Or is it just going to like flip And be like Hey guys look Now we re Summer but we re upside down That s what I don t understand He has a very good question okay His question is why is what hemisphere are you talking about The Northern Hemisphere Okay So why is the Northern Hemisphere always tilted towards the Sun how he s walking away Because his argument is that Oh I have it right here Go ahead It says Because the Earth s axis is slightly tilted when the North Pole is laying towards the Sun and South Pole is laying away from the Sun And when the South Pole is leading towards the Sun the North Pole is leading away from the Sun It says As a result the number of daylight hours in the Northern and Southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the Earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator the hemisphere that leads towards the Sun has a long day and short nights Does that have to do with anything See I Wait Does that have to do with anything That s Sabrina s question Does that have to do with anything So summarize what you just read to us Does the tilt have like also have to do with like the days and like the short days and short nights Does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights and long days and short nights Shawn you re shaking your head yes You think it does have to do with it Say yes Yes You think it does have to do with it Why Who could help him explain why would a tilt change the length of day Move over Lucas Because like it s if like it ll be indirect Sun if it s tilted away from it And instead of like I don t know I think it is because I think another thing in the direct rays because the way we re tilted it s the number of daylight hours because of the less Sun as much of the Sun because of the tilt and how the Sun hits it when its on its tilt I think like see how it tilted that way No why don t you use it Why don t you boys sit down and let Pass that globe over to Byers and let him explain What I think is You know how it s tilted this way Maybe it ll tilt the opposite direction for the Summer Like instead of it being tilted towards this it ll tilt the other way for the South Instead of the North be showing the South would be showing That s what I think Where is the Sun That s what I m not understanding The Sun would usually be in the middle You need a hand Yeah Okay go ahead be the Sun again The Sun s in the middle And that s why if it s tilted this way we re getting our Sun but I thought if it would tilt the opposite way like instead of being tilted this way it d tilt that way then the South would get more Sun Okay So how But what you re asking is the same question as Lucas Yeah How does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the Sun That s what you re trying to figure out Whenever Lucas walked it around the whole time what hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun The Southern Hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun And the Northern Hemisphere was pointing away from the Sun Ben No I thought it was the Northern was pointing to the Sun and the Southern was pointing the other way But it remained constant the whole orbit Yes That s what I couldn t figure out like how did it just like did it like flip around and all of the sudden Maybe the Sun it changed What do you guys think Does the Sun move JJ you haven t been in here yet I think like every day it moves a little to the other side Wait what does The Earth The Earth moves everyday Yeah it might Like it tilts every day It tilts the tilt is changing Is that what you re saying So the tilt changes What were you gonna say I think the It The Earth like doesn t move like when it stays in one spot I think it might like flip Like kind of like just go around like Can you show us Do you wanna show us Sure I ll try I was gonna say maybe like as it s as like the Earth turns around maybe it like tilts forward every so often and backward So you re telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips Yes Okay so what are you saying It just goes around like this and eventually it just like spins around So it spins on top of its rotation Yeah What do you think Brad I think yeah I kind of agree with him Wait with who with David While it s like going around its orbit it just like tilts So the tilt is changing Yeah What do you think Alec You haven t said anything yet I don t agree with him I think that it spins while its moving around Don t raise your hand you don t have to raise your hand Only this like what Nick just did or maybe every day it goes a little bit and tilts like this And the Sun hits more of the Southern It s like everyday goes a little bit little bit little bit so where the South starts to get more Sun Because like when we re in Summer and Australia has Winter So when we re in Winter Australia has Summer So And it s in the Southern half and we re in the Northern half Wait Tiffany you were shaking your head Do you agree with what he s saying Sort of yeah Because if one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight the most likely it s gonna be warmer than the other Like he was saying when we get more sunlight and the temperature s warm up here the temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere get a little colder if they don t have as much sunlight and not as much warmth You see what I mean Like say I m right here the Sun is tilted so you see how the Sun s right here And then it tilts a little bit like this We re still getting Summer sunlight but Australia s getting more sunlight I have to agree with what JJ said earlier It tilts everyday So the tilt is changing You think that the tilt is changing Morgan you think the tilt is changing No I don t think it s changing I think it s staying the same because even I think the rotation helps because if it goes around the orbit even though its rotating it helps Like Nick you re the Sun like and the axis stays and when it rotates the Earth rotates and it s like kind of it like helps us I don t know like indirect sunlight I don t know Something like that I can show what she means I think Go ahead I think it s also about the gravitational pull Like when it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull As it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull Okay when you do this Grace please explain to me what it is So that everybody here that s watching can try and make sense of what we re talking about I think what she s saying is like say Nick s the Sun again Since the Northern is that way I think she s saying is it doesn t rotate but this is but we re kind of going around kind of like this So then it changes So now the Southern is towards the Sun and the Northern is that way So now it s changed She did something very different in her orbit Did anybody catch that Yeah yeah Like she it didn t move it just went around like around the Sun What do you mean it didn t move The Earth stayed still and just moved at one point It didn t do that Okay let s do it again okay And I want you to make sure that number one everybody sees where you start and everybody sees what happens to the Earth as she s showing you how it s going around So explain to us What is this Where are we starting Okay we re starting out this way with the Northern towards the Sun and the Southern away from the Sun And as we are rotating I don t know if all of you guys can see this But as we re going around Stop there It s not moving So since it s not moving now the Northern is kind of like facing away and the Southern is facing towards the Sun now Keep going And then just make sure that the camera can see what you re talking about as you go around Okay So did everybody see that Who doesn t understand that Who didn t understand what she did right there Okay So Now I don t understand actually wouldn t it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis and then start rotating again I m not sure what you mean by that Like you spun it like this All right But the Earth is going like this the whole time Would that end up stopping and then it go like this Or is that still happening It s not turning like that It s just rotating around the Sun Wait Sabrina you had something to say Okay So here s what s happening Lucas is a little confused about your explanation okay So we just have to go through it again What did you have to say Sabrina The earth doesn t change its tilt It stays like an exact same position but when it goes around the Sun it gets like different ways like the Sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers Okay wait why don t you try to show him Maybe it s just a different person Maybe it will help explain it okay So the more people we can get information out of remember the more we re gonna understand So start and tell us what s happening And just make sure the camera can see what you re doing The Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun and the Southern is facing away So this causes colder weather and up here where it s facing the Sun causes warmer weather So when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here the Southern is facing towards Wait is the Southern facing towards The Southern s facing towards the Sun And the winter is facing away Which causes it to be warmer down here and Winter up here Who can help her out because What I don t understand is Go ahead go ahead I don t understand it because it s still changing from day to night but then it s shifting so wouldn t it have to stop spinning and then shift If it stops spinning we re gonna die Not necessarily Okay wait Ben start from the beginning and explain what s going on Nick is our Sun still Put your legs in so he doesn t trip Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun Southern s away And it s still spinning it doesn t change Okay And so stop there and what s happening The Southern Hemisphere s towards the Sun and the Northern s away from it And what happened to the tilt the whole time It didn t change It what It didn t change It didn t change it stayed the same But that made more sense Like I couldn t figure out why it wasn t spinning but now I do And then it keeps going And then it just goes back Now I understand Okay Let s use this model and try to figure out where are the seasons happening So where do we live Anna We live Yeah where he s pointing What s that called somebody America North America North America let s get bigger Northern Hemisphere What Byers The Northern Hemisphere Okay so we live in the Northern Hemisphere Right now what s happening It s Summer It s Summer in the Northern Hemisphere Does everyone see that Yes Yes Anybody not see it s Summer in the Northern Hemisphere see it Yeah Okay so 
NFL Yeah So here s like you can see that the professional players who can pay that money They re really rich so there s so much sponsors that they pay for their helmets But like in high school football what they want is long pass cheaper material So they don t care much about The health about the guys they want to go just Their problem is the money of the helmets How much cost of helmet is like helmets with Kevlar or that stuff like they use in the military equipment So how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can save these thoughts So what kind of ideas you guys have How could you design a helmet so it s not this big or really neat and super expensive The type of padding we use So what ideas do you guys have So what kind of So you play football What kind of padding right now is inside of the helmet I mean they re not soft It s like it s air glove It s almost like a hard balloon stuck to your head So it s just one on the side and the whole top is full and one on the other side and one in the back But that s it I mean you could actually feel the hit But it you just don t get a concussion unless you re heavy So have you ever been hit Have you ever had a helmet to helmet contact So where did you get hit My head Almost like right here On top of your head Right but there s padding there Oh but you said you could still feel it I mean I could feel it for like a quick couple of seconds or so Then it just goes away It s because of the padding I guess It s umm It s like So is there any way that you would change the design of the helmet that you have now Um more cushion Okay So that s kind of going back to what Angel was talking about So how can we change the design to make it more cushiony but Because if you have something that s too cushiony right is that going to decrease the time or increase the time and decrease the force if it s really cushiony Oh that s really cushiony Yeah Oh you mean like it will just go Yeah No Right So you re saying you want it more cushiony you re saying you want it cheaper you re saying you want it smaller I think like what Matt s kind of saying is more for comfort than for safety Right Right So why So can you relate sort of to what Angel s saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous Umm with the head rattling Like if it hits on this side it s quicker to hit the other side Is that what you mean what So how So think about how the padding is right now How it s stiff compared to something that kind of gave So think about relating this back to force times the change in time You can ask If it s built too soft it s going to hit you with a stronger force So what could happen to the time It s going to be slower it s going to be faster It s going to be faster so what s going to happen to the force The force is going to increase So it s going to hurt even more and it will be more dangerous So what you need is like a stable material that not too soft but at the same time So besides Kevlar which you brought up which is I was thinking like like for example when you are hit and you re hit you want that like bulletproof that the force spreads in all the space of the body of the helmet So is you are hit here all the force is not concentrated in this place but is moving over all the helmet So it displaces the force so it s not on one area So I was like thinking like maybe like this big the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits it spreads to all the helmet So that s you versus less you spread all the force on your head so you have like less Something that will transfer the motion Yeah I like this idea But what I was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something cushiony on the outside so that it takes time for you to hit the helmet And once you hit the helmet the small cushiony so that it takes time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again and then hit you So kind of like an atmosphere Yeah it will have like little layers It will probably have to make the helmet a little bit like bigger But not like Don t make it like huge but have layers on there and then incorporate his idea when you re making waves So something like that first layer could help dissipate the force So we have cushiony against cushiony like boxers use And then they have the hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping So we have the cushiony part first So it s going to take time and I think that s what they use They put cushion on there so that it takes time for you to actually feel the force So that the force will be less And if you have cushion with cushion It s because you are increasing the time Yeah because if you have two helmets that are hitting each other that are cushion and cushion it will take longer for them to hit each other And then the force will be decreased My question for Matt is How big is the helmet Oh The padding It s like thick It s kind of thick That s just the padding and then you have the helmet which is like that much more Yeah It s like that thick How heavy is the helmet Like when you re wearing it does it feeling like it s weighing you down Yeah it takes time to get used to it And that day you re neck will hurt That s how heavy it is Another version of like what we are trying to do I think it d also be cool Maybe like helmet were like it was fitted to like the head and then it d have like inbetween kind of like a net structure which is a part of uh kind of like what he had but something that is hung I want to kind of imagine it like the bridges How they have like a whole bunch of little columns But just a whole bunch that is attached to the outside of the helmet I will draw it and I ll show you guys You had your hand up do you want to share while he Yeah I was wondering since we re talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the type of brain damage that you can get Just like an actual name Like I heard concussion Other injuries other names Can you tell What a concussion is What is a concussion Ask the group Well a concussion is when It s when you your brain between your actual brain and your skull There is a liquid like Spinal fluid is it and that s supposed to cushion your brain from touching the or hitting your skull But a concussion is when it s hitting and it s going back and forth I mean gradually it will go back to normal but That s my understanding of concussion And you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest areas of the impact So what part do you think is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain on your brain The sides What do the sides control Well it wasn t like that I thinking like in the structure of the of the skull So the sides where the nerves enter like Your optic nerves Yeah So I think that s like less pain It s like a really big hit here can kill a man So I think that hit is worst You re saying the skull is thinnest right there Yeah It s not as thick as the other parts It s thickest like right here What does your frontal lobe control So that s what kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most developed frontal lobe And then on the sides is more of your sensory stuff and then in the back is your actually your Occipital lobe for your eyes is in the back a long with your movement your cerebellum So different spots that s why you have padding here and here and back here is to protect all sides of the brain So a concussion is just like your brain keeps vibrating basically after the blow So I like to think about it and I meant to bring this in and I apologize So if you have Think about your Tupperware and inside the Tupperware you have an egg You just cracked a nice egg inside and then you shake it So imagine that egg is your brain And that Tupperware is your skull So the harder you rattle it what s going to happen to the egg It will break It s gonna break right The yolk s going to break right I mean your brain doesn t really break But you can think that It s just kind of the movement Because if you think about what does Newton s first law say An object that s in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by outside force So if the brain If you get hit here which way is your brain going to go That way Until it hits the skull and then it s going to thunk So that s what they call rattling your cage I was thinking of like when I play baseball when I swing the bat and I hit the ball and my hands keep like I can feel it inside and like even after a minute it will keep rattling So now take that and think about how that would Okay So David can you uh Explain what you have so we can This is kind of like the bridge idea that I had where like there s like different columns that go around like the frame So in this it would kind of be like the head goes right here and the helmet s right here And these would be like some kind of material that s bendable So when something hits it they would bend in so to absorb kind of the impact Kind of like a cage in the racing cars Like how racing cars have a cage inside of them Just in case they roll over the cage still protects the person Yeah kind of No but Yeah kind of like that but these are like cushions Yeah So they absorb the momentum So like a coil Like for your bed The bed spring that when you jump up on it you rebound back so Wouldn t that be more dangerous if it s elastic Yeah it s elastic and when we did the little cars When it was elastic it completely transferred all of its momentum to the other car So when you get hit it will just like swing and then all the momentum will hit you instead of both of you sharing it So if you share it d probably be better But I don t know if that s Because I was also thinking of mattresses A little sleep mattresses and how they talked about the coils and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger over here than over here and then they have the new ones now that are like foam The Tempurpedic ones Yeah So I was thinking also if you like spread out where the momentum goes Saying if you spread out where it won t be in one certain area Then you won t get hit really hard right here And if you get hit hard like over here it d probably be better than getting hit hard just right there Yeah It will probably be less of a force So when they design like a helmet they ve got one piece thing where it s like your body their shoulder pads connected to their helmet So your body absorbs some of that too instead of just your head So that depends how you turn your head And would it be good if your body have you guys ever heard that people who are like drunk drivers they kind of walk away from a car crash and it s the passengers or the victims are the ones that get hurt the most So think about what s different between their body in motion and the other person s body in motion So they re looser right They re not tightening their muscles compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact We flex right Just waiting for it and so by being more rigid your body doesn t move You re trying to fight against the motion So you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that Because you It hurt your body more because you re trying to fight against what you re body is actually going to do instead of the other person who s just like really loose is moving with it so there s not as much impact Well I ve been playing football and how you play like you want to win You hit someone you want to After that you re still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like I know What he is saying is like if you see someone about to collide with you you want to hit him back instead of Yeah Why is that Related that to momentum Because momentum is vector right So you have to think about the direction and of the way that things are moving So think back to When we were playing with different cars So you had the greater mass in one car going this way And had the smaller mass going this way Right So what would you want to do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the Raise his speed Increase the speed right And so by knowing that you re going to get hit you re going to run a little faster So then what was the what is the ending result there So like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass Mean like how do you think is like Inelastic I don t know like So what s going to happen Are they going to stay stuck together So it s elastic so it comes off right Think about it like a rubber band an elastic rubber band You can stretch it so elastic is is saying something that s going to rebound whereas inelastic you re just rigid There is no motion I guess you should say I thought that was inelastic when you hit something it will both go off completely and elastic it will stick together And inelastics magnets 
 How do you know Because my dad works Oh okay See I want us to think about that because that was something that came up yesterday Sometimes we think Oh that s only stuff men do or That s only stuff women do But especially mechanics working on engines and stuff like that we think That s a man s job But you said your dad works with a lot of women and Kyle your dad s a kind of a mechanic too and he works with a lot of women too So girls think about that kind of thing Okay thank you very good All right now Carter come up please Carter All right Carter Tell us about the job works on people when they are injured firefighters work on burning equipment and carrying test hydrants and inspect businesses Okay so your job is Say it real loud so they can hear you A firefighter and a paramedic Okay and what are the skills that that job uses Math reading writing computer technology There it is Be proactive begin with the end in mind first thing s first think win win synergize Great okay So all of the seven habits right Okay interesting who s next And are there women firefighters Yes and paramedics Absolutely Good job Carter Okay Taylor Taylor Green All right Taylor tell us the job A machinist And tell us a little bit about what they do Repair and turbine engines for helicopters and tanks Helicopters and tanks and they use what Math technology be proactive Okay very good Do you think women can do that kind of job Yes Absolutely Okay so we said math technology are big ones there working on the helicopters tanks things like that Okay next let s have Lexi Lexi Wilson All right Lexi All right tell us about your job Furniture showroom manager I assist customers with furniture purchases inventory the furniture we have on hand update customers orders All right and we use what skills Math science Oh I wasn t watching you That s okay not so much science Reading writing computer technology Be proactive put first things first think win win and synergize Okay now I m gonna ask you a hard question Science the person with that job indicated they use science in a furniture showroom management position How do you think they use science Maybe they make the furniture The materials maybe they use and stuff like that Good good job all right thank you Okay so we can see that all of the skills that we re learning in school right now especially technology skills computer skills reading math even science our parents are using those jobs uh skills in their jobs right now in real life So someday you re gonna be using exactly what you re doing right now in a job as well as our personal skills our seven habit skills being in charge of ourselves thinking about things ahead of time planning ahead putting first things first good job All right now we re gonna take our group cards and on the cards you have a job listed one of the jobs that you re looking at in your group and a skill that goes along with that job What I want you to do is as a group discuss how can we show the use of that skill in our job that we have okay So look at your cards figure out how you re gonna use the skill listed on the skill card and then we re gonna role model to the rest of the class the use of our skill and show how we use that skill in the job that s on that card okay So start discussing and then in a few minutes I m gonna call you back and we re gonna start showing the rest of the class our skills We re the paralegal We could do well for reading skills we could do filing or we could prepare bills for clients But to prepare bills for clients we d have to read you know who they are and then for filing we d have to read whose bill it was Class when your children get ready for heading where they go down to gym for the program this morning we are right now in the process of calling kindergarten we re gonna get them to head down the hallway to the gym first and then we re going to have second grade come on down third grade fourth grade and fifth grade Okay so Payton is gonna lay on the floor and then I m gonna get to do a knee surgery on him First I ll like get a pencil pretend I m cutting the knee open and pulling it and then cutting the muscle and replacing the broken parts of the knee bone with Like using our skills we can measure the wire right here And we could measure how long it could be for the house electricity circuits and we can measure how long the wire is and somebody could be in the house and we could measure how long the wire is So let s do the thing we did yesterday When you re laying on the floor and I m trying to put the breath back in you and then I ask Carly what happened okay So you two are doing it Do you think maybe a table and chairs and maybe a couch Yeah a sofa and then you ll get over behind the table and everything and then I can say what day and what time And that s writing down what Writing skills Writing skills Very good very good We re gonna show like you you would be like typing on the computer and you would be and I would come up and ask what you re doing and so the other people would know what you re doing on the computer I would come up and ask what you re doing and you would say I m making a blueprint Like cause if we did use set up machines for production and we use synergize we d have to work together to do it and how do we do that Miss Kimberly Yes ma am How do we act out setting up for productions setting up machines Well since you re act you want to show synergizing now what does synergizing mean Working together Okay so you need to involve Working together Yeah okay And certainly with being a mechanic you re working on what Machines Machines and so what you wanna try to demonstrate is everybody working together To build a machine Possibly that would be a good one I think All right we re going to go ahead and start our demonstrations So I m gonna ask Morgan Landon and Abby s group to show us their skill And tell us what your job is tell us what s your job A paralegal A paralegal and your skill is Reading Okay Let s see how they re using reading Second grade and third grade please come on down to the gym thank you Okay great that s good Now what were they doing Filing reading Filing exactly very good good job Okay let s have Luke Destiny Payton and where do you guys wanna go Up here All right Tell us your job Certified surgical tech Wonderful and your skill Put first things first First things first okay Clear Okay great So what were some Luke what was the first thing you did The first thing first I had to gently cut his knee open and pull it apart And then Cut his muscle and pull it open and then get a mini saw and cut the pieces of the knee bone and replace it Okay and then what would be the last thing that a surgeon does Stitch the knee back together Okay all right good job Clear Good job first thing s first Okay all right now we wanna see Reagan Mackenzie and Logan let s see y all And where do you wanna go In the middle Okay that s fine And tell us your job Electrician that uses math skills Okay electrician Come in It s over here He s measuring how long the wire is 3 feet Okay okay Now what were they doing Measuring the wire Electrician and you were say it again Say what you were We were measuring the wires Measuring Measuring okay so and measuring is part of Math Math very good All right good job good job Okay all right let s have let s see it ll be Josh Alyssa and Taylor G Our job is maintenance mechanic 
 The corners The corners that s fine How do you get exactly one painted face Which one of these have just one color on them The middle Yeah just the ones in the middle on each face And how many of them are there Six So that s 6 out of 27 So that s fine And realize that if you did it right those are all your options Each of these cubes has either zero colors up to three colors Nothing has four colors So that means all your probabilities should add up to what 27 27 out of 27 Does it No No so what s the issue One of these numbers at least has to be off So figure out which one that is See if you could figure what one So keep in mind these look right But realize these are all probabilities because you re picking them out of that hat So these should all be out of 27 Right because there s 27 cubes you re picking from Right And if you did it right and these are all the cubes then they should add up to what 27 Right does it Yeah it does 27 okay so fine Good So when you do the next one it should all be out of We can figure that out You can figure that out Isn t it 16 times 4 so 64 So where are you getting these numbers from My mind Okay so I get no painted faces There s just the one cube that s right in the middle So that s one out of Because you re picking them out 1 out of 27 You gotta do a probability right But then how many have one painted face How d you get six Which six The middle ones Sure the middle ones And there s six faces so it makes sense 6 out of 27 How do you get three painted faces I didn t do that one Okay The corners So that should be eight And then realize if you did this right it should all at up to what 27 27 out of 27 So how do you figure out how many have two painted faces Just add these together and subtract them Yeah you could do that Now there is a pattern to the two just like the other ones But you can also subtract and figure that out So yeah good Oh that brings up a good point Everybody for your first cube For your very first cube everything should be out of what number 27 27 All your probabilities should be out of 27 Is it possible you can reduce the fractions when you figure it out Yes Yes I m gonna tell you don t reduce them Leave it out of 27 Even if it s 3 out of 27 don t reduce it to one ninth Just leave it at 3 out of 27 it ll help you down the line So those look good And you know One of the ways you could check if you did this right is all four of these should add up to what 27 27 And does it Yeah It adds up to 27 out of 27 So you got all your bases covered So that s good Okay good keep going How many have no painted faces Four Why four which four The four is right over here inside and then there s four Okay but let me ask you this there s these four But you said go inside a layer And then you re right there s four underneath But then there s another layer underneath that So there s eight So there should be eight And one of the ways you know you re right about this besides just hoping that you re thinking about it the right way How do you know there s three painted faces Which eight are you talking about The corners The corners So you know you re right with the eight but these should all add up to what And they do so you re okay Okay good So keep going and you re good it s all out of 64 So that s a good start Will this still have one painted face Well there is a pattern to it just like the other ones But it s fine if you can t figure that out yet Just keep going you ve got the right number So see if you can figure it out now for the 4x4x4 How are we doing on the front side Everything good So let me ask you this about this stuff I assume you all have the same answers Yeah So you said one painted face there s six of them Which six Just one color painted Sure the center of each of the six faces And there s six faces so six times one is six That s fine No we got 8 out of 27 for three Because which ones are you looking at The corners No painted faces there s just one in the middle If you added all these up what should they equal But what does it equal up to Not 27 So what s the issue What s the deal there No idea Where is there something going wrong Because you know that one has to be eight You know there s exactly one because it s the center one in each of the six sides So you know that has to be six The issue is with the two painted faces It s not eight Now you can figure it out by subtracting and just figuring out what adds up to 27 Or you could go back and just look at those how many of those have the two painted faces Where are you getting eight from Which cubes here have two painted faces These ones So that s four on this front side There s four on the back side That s eight Two on this side 10 12 12 Does that make sense And that adds up to 27 then when you add all those up So now do the same thing for the one out of 64 Okay Good How we doing These should add up to 64 shouldn t they They should add up to 64 How do you get no painted faces How do you get the four with no painted faces The center pieces So over here let s say these four in the middle But you re not looking at those Those have one painted face but you look a layer below that And that s four right there But you can go a layer below that So that should be eight So does that mess up something else I don t know how you got the other numbers So the equation for this it d be distance divided by two to get three Does that work up here You re on the right track You re thinking the right way Minus two Does that work I mean once you get this I would try to do a 5x5x5 cube Even though I didn t write it down there See if it holds up Yeah because there d be 27 in the middle That seems to make sense And that ll help you on the back side when you get there So these look fine Let s talk about this one for a second If you add these up you have 24 24 18 4 If you add all those up what do you get Do you 60 60 Right now you have 60 out of 64 So there s four squares you haven t counted yet Where did they go And you kinda know you re right with the three colored cubes because you know which ones they are Which ones are those So would we add it to the non painted faces Why You can t randomly What s the pattern Which ones have no painted faces The ones on the top So basically you have these four right here but a layer below right But there s also another layer below that Oh so it s eight So that s where there s eight Does that make sense Oh yeah I see that So that s where that s coming from So now it adds up to 64 It looks like you re probably good Why don t you try doing it for a 5x5x5 cube before you go to the back side so at least you have some patterns you can detect It ll make the back side easier But it should be a breeze now to get the 5x5x5 cube Wow Chris You re on a roll Smart idea making a graph And that should be eight over what Over here how many squares do we have We have 27 And you got that because it s Three cubed Three cubed And the other one is four cubed If you do the 5x5x5 it would be five cubed So if you have an nxnxn what is that n cubed So everything should be out of n cubed on the back And you re right that it s eight out of n cube for the three painted Why don t you try the no painted That s probably the next one to get But what there s the one middle How do you figure that out And this is where you gotta go back and look at the pattern you got for no painted faces How did you figure that out And maybe the numbers help but maybe just look at the picture and figure out how did we know how many had no painted faces Right What do those numbers have in common Okay How we doing Well you re definitely right with eight over n cubed That makes sense right Because always the corners in the cube It s always the same How did you get 6n here And you got it over here You guys have 6n in different places Well see I thought I got a brain blast What But it didn t work out I mean I felt really smart for two seconds But I was thinking that since there s six sides it has to be six times something Okay Okay that s not a bad way to think You know the answer here was 12 Yeah That was with the 3x3x3 cube Does that work If n is three you would get 18 But that s not what you got on the front side So there s some discrepancy Okay But that s not a bad way to think Some of these things have to do with six faces Like there s some multiplying by six involved You know the corner ones are gonna be eight no matter what That has nothing to do with six faces Right Right that s just the corners How do you do this Go back a second Sorry a lot of flipping You feel confident about these two sets of numbers Yeah So why don t you try doing it 5x5x5 cube even though I didn t ask for it But see what numbers you get for that because it ll make the back page a little better Because now you ll have more numbers to use and try to find a pattern You guys have different numbers Why is that What do you mean On the front side What do you mean Sarah has 8 out of 64 here You have 4 out of 64 here Oh blood Oh my god Do you need to go Go go Go to the bathroom I don t care I care go Do you have band aids now I don t know I don t think I do Go to the bathroom Things still happen So you have eight out of eight cubed That s fine We know the three painted faces are going to be which ones The corners The corners And there s always gonna be eight So that s fine Eight out of n cubed How do you figure out how many have zero painted faces It s always the ones in the middle Yes always the ones in the middle So when you had a 3x3x3 cube what was in the middle One And what s the dimensions of that cube 1x1x1 When it was a 4x4x4 cube what were the dimensions of the middle That you couldn t see 4x4x4 Well 4x4x4 is the whole cube 2x2x2 2x2x2 If it was a 5x5x5 cube what would be the middle 3x3x3 3x3x3 If its an nxnxn cube what s the middle You kinda have it If it s 6x6x6 what s the middle I don t know I m kinda lost Okay go back for a second You lost me at the 5x5x5 one Okay you know its 3x3x3 And the center was 1x1x1 That s the ones you couldn t see any color 4x4x4 cube what s the center 2x2x2 If it s a 5x5x5 cube let s say What would the center be 3x3x3 3x3x3 If it s a 6x6x6 cube 4x4x4 If it s an nxnxn cube n minus two Times n minus two times n minus two So what s the pattern for no painted faces n minus two cubed Exactly That s the sort of pattern you need to find for those first two now How are you figuring these out when you actually have a concrete 5x5x5 cube Is this what you re supposed to do Because it s saying that n is the number of small cubes so you can t just say it s a 4x4x4 n is representing the whole 125 cubes right Right So is this the correct equation for one painted sides For one painted side Yeah For one painted side Well how are you finding the one painted face Or how many painted cubes did you have here I had six Six which six It s basically the one in the center but there s six faces so we multiplied by six So I get where this is coming from The multiply by six So n represents the 125 n represents how many across you have Oh I thought n represented the whole No I mean 
 5 03 5 03 All right let s talk for a minute before you continue with your little test First of all let s talk about motion What do you know about motion Motion is the way that you get from one place to another It s changing position Changing position so just now Bailey was running was he changing position Yes Yes all right so how do we know that he was in motion Like when he is running toward me how do I know he s in motion That stays there and you can see him coming up Nobody else was moving around So that s our frame of reference He came over there so we know he s coming toward us All right so you guys did a trial How many times did you run Bailey Three All right so what are we gonna do now We re gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three Why are we dividing by three Because we did it three times Okay you did it three times You re finding your average What s another word for average Mean Mean good All right so let s find his mean or his average And then we ll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number Okay what did you get 5 21 5 21 is that what everybody has Nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that Let s name some things that are in motion What do you know that s in motion The earth The earth is in motion yup But I don t feel the earth move so how do I know it s in motion Cause sun is the frame of reference Okay so if I was thinking of the sun which is what they do and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference What else do you know that moves Animals Animals Insects Cars Insects cars Boats People People books Boats Boats All right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what s something else that I need to know besides how long it took him The distance The distance traveled which is a hundred feet So what difference did we do Hundred feet A hundred feet Okay so what s the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet Yes You did that and chalk marked it Good all right so let s We re talking about the average time taken All right so let s do that now 19 So let s talk about what that means 19 19 Feet per second What s that mean Feet per second 19 feet per second So if I say feet per second can you explain that to me What does that mean 19 feet per second Every second I would go 19 19 feet Good okay so if I m driving in my car and my car s going 70 miles per hour and I m on the interstate do I say my car s going 75 No No you d say miles per hour bleh 70 miles per hour Can you tell me Nathan why What does that mean 70 miles per hour 70 miles per hour means you re going 70 miles per each hour For every hour so that s good to know for vacations right Especially when you have little kids who are saying Are we there yet You gotta figure out how long it s gonna take you Are we there yet Right okay All right you re going to go into your next part and I ll be right back to check on you Who s the next person Jordan It s gonna be Jordan All right Miss Jordan Hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up He thinks he needs one more piece of tape Ready Ready Set go 1 76 1 89 Okay so why don t you write them both Do you have two spots Only have one You have two spots write one there and one there That s what you do there just like that What did you get 1 89 1 89 All right let s come talk about what you re doing So let s get the three kinds of balloons that you re testing Just gonna bring over here Dan why don t you get the um come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one We might try that one here So we have A big round one A big round one a green one okay A long one Okay And a birthday one Did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions Different Different predictions what do you think The Happy Birthday one You think the Happy Birthday one Long Long Long Long Can you tell me why you think Happy Birthday and then you ll tell me why you think long At first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it But now there s wind blowing It blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster It d be like this wind Yes You had this big That is a pretty good prediction Why do you guys think it s gonna be the long one I think it s the long one because it s more smaller and the air can come off faster and it s more stretchier Stretchier Tight it s more tight All right all right we had some wasn t going all the way so we changed it to 20 It would stop about maybe three feet away from the end It would stop so what did you decide to do We changed it to 20 You moved it to 20 Okay so What else could you have done besides move it to 20 Blow up the balloon more Maybe blow up the balloon more Maybe the little one wouldn t have worked though huh It s not that much in there We tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped The little one I think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far All right so All right So let s come back this way Watch out behind you Megan Dan you can go over to There s motion in the wind huh 176 and 108 All right so here we go What are you gonna do first Let s do the round balloon first That was nobody s prediction right Nope So let s do that one first What are we gonna do 20 Add both up And then what are you gonna do Divide by two Why are we dividing by two To get the average To get the average Why did you do it twice Why didn t you just And there s two the two trials Why you did two trials Why wouldn t you just do one Why do you think that would ve been better to do two Divided by Then we wouldn t have to divide it we wouldn t have to find the average at all But I guess we d get a better result What d you get there 2 35 3 73 That s what I got 2 35 You add these two together and you divide them Remember this is the average Can you have four I divided by two but I got 3 73 Let s try again On the calculator I always do things twice to double check 2 35 2 35 Everybody s good Okay so let s go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed So what s our formula for that How do we figure out average speed You do 20 because of the Okay so that s when we took 20 because you see we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30 So let s cross out you changed it to 20 And I think it was Dan that said if we were to probably no Hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon But changing the feet that ll work Now how fast did the first balloon go 19 35 by 20 Look at your formula again 8 52 Your distance is 20 so you re gonna do your distance divided by your average time Good 8 51 Okay and I ll come back to check on you you All right let s see how these guys are doing This one s a runner The line s over here right Jordan 16 16 We re at the end of Nathan s so let s go ahead and figure out Nathan together I ll come sit in your spot They re in here So to figure out Nathan let s talk about it together while we re doing it We need some more calculators over here Wait what s this 641 Everybody please do catch up Got your pencils Wait wait 641 575 Tell me again what we re doing average time 6 08 Does everybody have six Read it back correctly Six point O eight Is that how you read it correctly in math Six decimal Do we say decimal Six Six point zero eight Do we say point Six and And Eight hundredths Six and eight hundredths Ohhhh Gotta get it So let s look just at our average time for just a second Stop for a minute and let s look at the top at our average time How do we know who is going the fastest when we re look at just the top part just the time Average time The lowest The lowest number right cause he s getting in the fastest time So now when we go to the bottom and we re figuring out the speed how do we do speed Whoever s the lowest number The highest number The highest number it s going to be Let s go ahead and do Nathan and then we ll compare then we ll let Demi do hers 16 point 16 point 16 44 right Yep So let s look so far at the bottom Bailey Jordan and Nathan Who is the fastest So far Bailey So far Bailey okay so how can we instead of looking at this this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me What can I do visually just to make it a little bit clearer Make a bar graph Okay we can make a bar graph with this Anything else we can do Line graph Maybe get each person to make a line graph Take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times Because that would be you right over time That would be a great idea So we can do the straight line graphs That s a good idea with the line graph Bailey So when we make a line graph we ll do that at the end using this information and then we ll do a bar graph using this information Does that sound good All right Demi s turn s up Let s go Let s see how we are doing here Okay we re at the very end So which one ended up being the fastest The long one The long one But I think that Devon had a very good prediction I think his reasoning was good See that wind blowing In a race when you re in a race and you re running or when you re in a foot ball team what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you re trying to get that ball to the other side You want the wind to be with you right Because if you re against the wind the wind is pushing on you so I think Devon had an excellent Good job Devon next time All right we re at the bottom Why do you think that balloon was the fastest I put The shape of it the wind went right past it All right remember there was unbalanced force So the force inside the balloon where was the force The wind the air The air that Devon blew inside that balloon the air inside pushed the balloon and that s what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go It probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it s on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes That s a pretty good idea too It s kind of like when you re driving a car if you re on vacation sometimes your parents you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler Why do you think they would do that Because the wind blocks the Because the wind is blocking 18 wheel blocks it The 18 wheeler s blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour I mean you can get better gas mileage doing that If you ever see your parents doing that Some people don t like to do that though because of rocks Rocks yeah it could be dangerous Yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks Good job 
 Counting on that I agree with AJ but also I think that What I want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what AJ was saying it s good to have a backup just in case you want it And we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there So we know that so we re having other people work with it but the problem is is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that What if they messed up What if they blow up or do something wrong And if they re not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there s gonna be a lot more problems and if it s not able to do the same things that s going to be completely bad too Okay Eric said Go up to fix things What would be some things that we would need to make sure that we re going up to maintain in space Just to kind of follow up International Space Station Okay International Space Station Some of the satellites we have in orbit Okay satellites that do what for us Television and communication Okay Ms McCall what s that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares You can just write Sun Probe Sun probe That s fine Excuse me while I turn this on And the Hubble Hubble s gone a lot longer than they expected it to so if it breaks we d want to repair it Especially since we don t have a new one Alana I know how Mer was talking about the risks like with the Challenger and that was really devastating but I remember the wife whose husband died on Challenger She said that he knew the risks That s part of being an astronaut and being in NASA and willing to go up there and you re risking your life It s not like they went in there totally blind about that I think that s kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now We have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that I say go for it Okay Blanca and then Megan I get what she s saying with they risked their lives but you re also risking the money and time that everyone has put into it They spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space And like the Challenger it just exploded and they didn t even really get that far just for one minor error And I don t think they should cut all the way like they were saying Have it just when you need it but it s still a lot of money that our country doesn t really have right now so maybe it s not the most important thing and there s other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that We ll go Megan then Bieber So you know how we re paying Russia to fly up to the International Space Station I think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station Because then we have more funding for NASA and then we have a shuttle Then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to Russia to fly up there I feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up not for free but we can fly up with the United States and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in They can pay us for it and then we get the money Okay Bieber you need to sit close Eli then we ll go Rachel I don t know what color to show but Russia s not making a profit off of us riding up there They re just trying to cover their costs It s not like we ll be doing good business ferrying people to the International Space Station It s not like a tourist attraction or anything It s pretty bland up there Russia s just trying to pay to get us up there That s the cost of flying somebody there They re not making profit out of it Okay good that s a downpoint Rachel I agree with what Eli said and also people were talking earlier about jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs And I think I read somewhere that they created 25 000 jobs or something like that But if you think about it if there s 300 million people that s still less than 1 of the population So while it seems like a big number it s still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else Especially with the economy so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on NASA on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on NASA and spending billions of dollars Amber then Clark I was going to say I kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now Any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now at this point in time So I don t think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that s also putting a lot of people out of work Clark The statistics with the jobs created are probably from when NASA was being used a lot and now that it s been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut And I don t think in this economy people need jobs requiring that much education not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that People just need regular jobs in general So you re saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe And like in science and stuff and not everybody has that That s a downpoint Luis Going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things I found out that the funding for NASA only accounts for 0 7 of the US government spending I feel like if you just cut all of that that s not really going to make a huge difference when the government s spending 99 3 on other things We ll go Hallie then Troy Going back to the risk of sending people out into space I researched and I found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened As we re pushing for more people and more money we re actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back The risk is just becoming more and more That s an interesting point As we re slowly cutting back on the budgets already we re automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts Troy I actually support them cutting the budget because for one when they cut budget they re setting aside money to buy more space exploration from private companies Those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government which also stimulates the economy a lot more I mean if everybody s employed by the government like what could happen to Greece Okay Shannon hasn t spoken Bieber Kind of off of what Holly said with the risk and everything going up I did a little research and with NASA there was only a 4 1 fatality rate Out of something like 439 astronauts there have only been 18 deaths I feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut Okay so even with the budget cuts we re not seeing this huge increase Jillian A lot of people are making the points that it s only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles but at the same time I don t think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide put off by one shuttle launch It s 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it s killing the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone not just the people in the space shuttle So you re taking the environmental aspect Besides looking at costs besides looking at jobs there s this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide What is the issue associated with carbon dioxide Jillian The ozone layer depleted and global warming Thank you global warming Tyler To go along with what Luis said they only get 0 7 of the national spending but we also have gained more knowledge from NASA than any other government thing We can discover maybe how Earth is going to end and we can discover things that are more important than other government government spending So you re kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending We ll go Eli then Justin Also Luis said it doesn t account for very much of the US budget and if we cut that spending it s really not going to go to anything more productive Maybe more guns or something It s not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people It s just going to go to corporations and wars And then in regards to CO2 emissions does anyone know how much CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year Far more than a truck driver Cows and moose I think they can flirt over that I think that s just moose So you re making the comparison to say the idea that even though it s a human made craft if we look at natural sources of the CO2 emission And the relative frequency that a moose passes gas A space shuttle launch doesn t have that big of an effect on the environment Touche Anyone have a cup that hasn t spoken yet that wants to jump in real quick Justin Going off of what Tyler said if we stop funding NASA then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of Earth just doesn t allow us to see that far So it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future Interesting point Amber then Eric Besides everything about the jobs NASA has created a lot of things that have helped us today different technologies Like in someone s presentation they were saying something about they re creating lighter systems for firefighters and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff So there s a lot of technology that s been created because of NASA so I think it s benefited us a lot more than it hasn t helped us And so you re saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives It s not just useful for exploring many new things I forgot my order Was it Eric on that one I have a couple different connections One of them s with the cost Like they re saying it s 0 7 of the total budget but the thing is not only is it that low of a cost it s 14 billion just to give you an actual number It s 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of NASA This year just for this year alone To give you a comparison it s around 640 between 680 for the military budget That is 47 times more expensive Now you can say Well alright that s the military The thing is that first of all it has a lot higher mortality rate Second of all it s a lot less productive in general I mean we re pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet I m sorry but that s not very cool in general For one of those things we re trying to get a high fatality rate not for our side but the other side But the other thing is that for jobs creations if you want to create more jobs and you re going for a more positive feel you wouldn t decrease funding for NASA you would increase funding Because think about it If you increased it 47 times to the military I m pretty sure you d get a lot more than one million even a lot lot more than just one million jobs from NASA if you increased this funding a lot because imagine whole new planets Just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet and with seven billion people we can t hold that many people very long on this planet But there are so many other planets out there that we could easily fit everyone There s enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet That s how many planets there are So you re thinking planning for the future that it might be beneficial for us Holly As I was researching I found out that there s really no short term benefits and we re not guaranteed long term benefits Yes we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us We re not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from magnetic storms There might be some way we can save ourselves but we re not guaranteed that So you re saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into the factor We can keep researching but we may never find the answer Monique you got some info Yeah I think when Hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks we ve talked about what was up there The benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section We gain knowledge we need to study the sun probe and Hubble and International Space Station With jobs it provides a whole section of jobs having shuttles go up to space Not only that but they ve created new inventions through that and I think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital Going from there there s going to be more Not just stopping now So again tying in the cost benefit analysis that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs A J and then we ll go Alana I guess to counter what Troy said and what a few people have said when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money It s not just about the economy When you think about it NASA wasn t meant to help the economy at all and it wasn t meant for job creation even though it has employed so many people Through the research that I did there was a story from somebody that s going to be retiring just because he knows he d lose his job anyway He said that After 30 years this is all I know We re losing the most brilliant minds our country has because they just don t know what else to do NASA s been open for decades and that s their job Technicians and analysts they re not going to just become accountants or something There s nothing after NASA That s probably the highest most prestigious thing What do you do after that It s not like they re just going to fill minimum wage jobs which is what most people are looking for right now anyway if you re thinking about job creation It s a good point you have all these highly educated specialized people as A J points out Where are they going to go Are they going to be able to find jobs within our country Are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries It s a good point Alana then Troy I know we re talking a lot about the cost benefit and job creation but I want to go back to the safety and I have a question for everyone just to think about The main part in all the failed missions especially with the shuttle and the Challenger it s basically been human error You know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn t listen that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and everything but I ve been thinking what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human and the possible errors that we make Like robots we use robots to build half our cars and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate So do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make That s an interesting point We ll have to put that on the question board Troy what you got Kind of to counter what A J said these people are highly educated Minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least Companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now People that have highly specialized degrees they re really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance Those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees If you can do quantitative physics those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who s just a finance agent So your counterpoint is the idea that because they re so highly educated they will find some sort of a niche Yeah There s a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better Interesting Jillian Back to what Alana said if you re using robots to make it safer that s also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots If you re using robots as the engineers then you re having people lose jobs Interesting point So kind of a counterpoint to shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics there s some drawback association We ll go Rachel Going back to what Eric said a while ago he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget but I feel like the military helps a lot of people and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people because the military pays for a lot of people s education university and stuff I know a lot of people now since university is so expensive a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for So I feel like it should have a higher budget because it s creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren t necessarily has a doctorate in physics or something People that are really smart like what Troy said they won t really have that much of a problem finding jobs especially with a big corporation They don t have to necessarily work for the government or NASA or something So I think that the budget should stay where it is because that s pretty funny We ll go Megan and Tyler I don t know when it was mentioned but we were talking about how we re trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed and I feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now we re trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that s gone I feel like that s really important for the development of Earth is to know what it s going to be like when there is no more What can we do so that we don t turn into a Mars or Venus What can we do now to stop it from happening Good so you re making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there s an issue with our magnetosphere Potentially could we wind up like Mars So kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed future wise So almost like a selfish need to figure out what s going on out there and where we might go Anyone that hasn t spoken yet want to comment 
 We haven t talked about some things that we do when we are what Sad Sad Not sad He s ma Mad Mad He is really really mad He s got that mad face going Rrrr He is so ugly He is so ugly He is mad And it says sometimes I get mad Is it okay if we re mad Yeah Yeah What is No If somebody eat people I bet that way too That must have been Ow Ow Ow If someone s biting they probably would get in trouble because we don t want to hurt our friends Ow No No we don t want to hurt our friends Ow Ow Ow or push them out of the chair Or push them out of the chair you re right that would hurt our friends too That s a man And we don t want to do that yes sir look up there Alright what are some things that make you mad Nick When somebody hurt on fingers When someone hurt your fingers that makes you mad That can make me mad too Jakiah what s something that makes you mad People bite me If someone bit you who bit you Deion Your brother I d be mad too cause that hurts our friends doesn t it Kendrel what s something that makes you mad My sister beat me off the chair and my sister threw my toys When she kicked your chair and threw your toys And broke my TV And broke your TV Oh I d be mad about that too Alright this page You don t got a sister Yes he has a sister this says I do when I get mad sometimes I I hit I Throw those toys throw our toys I Bite somebody I may bite or I may Yell Yell Are those good things to do No Why not Someone might cry In trouble because Nick said some might cry maybe it would hurt them And get in trouble They would but we don t want to hurt our friends do we And pull our hair or if someone yeah we don t want to pull our friends hair either cause the would hurt our friends Or pull somebody s braids Or pull somebodies braids that would hurt and that is not a good not a is it My uncle had braids Did he I do This said this is not a good idea that is a those are what those green choices or red choices Red choices Those are red choices Things we do not want to do Alright let s see what our next page says It says When I am mad it is a good idea too who remembers something that we can do who remembers something we can do when we re mad that s okay to do I know I know What If somebody get mad Then what can you do Kick somebody and punch somebody in the face Is that a green choice or a red choice Red choice Punching someone would be a red choice What s a green choice we could make Do you remember one Yeah that be good What is a good choice That maybe share with toys Maybe we could share our toys that would be a good choice here Criss cross please I m by myself criss cross please Kendrel said maybe we can share our toys Yeah Alright last time we talked about some other things We can do what Talk to some buddies Talk to our friends good Nick and what do we tell our friends Um If they took a toy from us what could we tell them Sorry Sorry No not sorry If we took a toy from our friends we could tell them sorry but if they took a toy from you and you got really really mad what words could you use Say give it back to me You could say give it back If they were doing something that you didn t like what could you say Give it back to me You could tell them to Sorry To st To stop If they re bothering you or doing something you don t like you can tell them to stop or leave me alone We can talk to who To our friends To the Teacher Teacher And what could you tell me To give back our toys Maybe that someone took my toy and I want it back and they wont give it to me Toys You re absolutely right good for you Jakiah Because you want your toys Yep or we talked about this one too what is that Cupped push on hands Take those hands arrrrr Sometime when we get mad it s okay if we squeeze our hands That might help makes us feel better Make us calm down a little bit Alright I have some of our pancakes Yeah Yay pancakes The Pancake Game Alright Yeah pancake games and on some of my pancakes are things that are Coo coo games red choices things that we don t want to do when we re mad and some of my things are green choices and if it s a green choice we re gonna add it to our book If it s a red choice we re gonna put it on our plate Okay Alright so Jakiah you want to go first Yes Alright are you ready Alright here you go ma am I want the pink one Flip it Oh that went way high past my head What is that boy doing Not your thing What is he doing Bite He s biting Is he biting himself or his friends His friend His friend His friend Is that something we want to do when we re mad Yeah Should we hurt our friends No That is not something we want to do We need to be good So Jakiah does that go on our red choice plate or is that a green choice that goes in our book It s the red choice It is a red choice plate you are right All of our red choices go on our plate You were right that was a red choice Put is right on top Nice thank you high five Good job Scoot back sit down Alright Nicholas are you ready Flip that thing I caught it What are they doing on there They are smelling that flower and blowing out the candle Can you show me how to do that Smell your flowers Now put the hand on top Do it one more time for me Sometimes we need to stop and take a deep breath to calm ourselves down Nick is that a red choice or a green choice Green choice It absolutely is a green choice Here s your sticky stuff I m gonna put it right there Can you stick that picture right on top please Our sticky tack Sticky tack Put it on top please Sticky tack Sticky tack Good job Sticky tack Nice thinking Okay High five Okay High five Nice work Have a seat Alright Kendrel Lowel are you ready Yeah What about this one Woah Woah Somebody push somebody off the chair Somebody pushed someone else off that chair Somebody broke that head off Right there It doesn t look like he has a neck does it You re right Woah That s just weird Try and see me Criss cross applesauce Jakiah show me criss cross please Thank you Alright Kendrel is that a green choice or a red choice Red choice Absolutely why is that a red choice because that is very bad Don t know when to snack or probably our friends at the playground Why is that a red choice Because they gonna get left Because it hurts their friends Friends It hurts their friends that pushed somebody off the chair Yep Alright Jakiah Jakiah Kendrel where does that one go On the red On the red choice plate You re absolutely right Alright miss Jakiah flip that pancake Boom What is he doing Numbers Numbers They are One two three And what are they doing they re Counting Can you help me count to ten One two three four five six seven eight nine ten If we get really mad at our friends can we stop what we re doing take a deep breath and count to ten to help calm ourselves down Yes Would that be a green choice or a red choice Green choice Absolutely it is a green choice Jakiah is that a green choice or a red choice Red choice A red choice Is it a red choice to count No Does that hurt our friends if we stop and count No Teacher So that s a green choice Something we can add to our book Though it s the red choice That s a green choice We can stop and count Our red choices are That s a green things that may hurt ourselves choice and a green or our friends choice It is a green choice Can you put it right there on our sticky tack in our book Sticky tack Put the picture on top please I know sticky s cake Alright you ready Mr Nick Yeah Sticky Okay let s do one more Lets see what else You re sticky we can do We could can we do this one Oh What are they doing Walking Walking They re taking a walk If we get really mad and we just need to get away from our friends for a minute is it okay if you come ask me to take a walk Yeah Yep We could walk around the hallways So is that a green choice or a red choice Green choice It absolutely is There s your sticky stuff Sticky stuff Your sticky tack Sticky tack It make stick Put it on quick please Or on the book please Good job Let me see Okay stick it on there Nice job Alright so let s look at some of the things that we have that we can do Can you scoot way over here so your friends can see Alright you guys help me read this If we get mad it s a good idea to Talk to people Talk to our friends We can tell our friends to Give it back to give it back or to Give us back the toys or to Stop Stop We can talk to who Jakiah who else can we talk to Our teacher Our teacher and what can we tell our teachers To give us back our toys We could say someone took my toy and they will not give it back or someone hit me Give it back Teachers Alright we could stop and do what That guy What can we do Good Kendrel This one This guy What could we do Nick Smell that flower and then blow that candle away We can stop and take a deep breath Smell that flower blow out that candle Deep breath Smell that flower We could Push the hands Push those hands how hard can you squeeze them Jakiah can you show me Nick s squeezing Kendrel s squeezing Alright we could ask our teachers to what They get a walk To take a walk Sometimes we may just need to to get out of our classroom and that is okay You re loud That was loud You re right You screamed But you know what I like how you used your words and told him You told him that you were screaming and that hurt my ears Alright using your words I did You did too Alright what s our last one we can One two Numbers We can stop and Count Count We count to ten One two three four five six seven eight nine ten It makes my teachers happy when I am calm and not mad 
 Okay let s get busy So before we change the car we have two more times Okay let s look Jacob let s help It s 9 3 What is 9 three 93 93 Is there a way that we can maybe change to other things here to make it go further Like the car Yeah How Maybe the height How about you guys discuss Oh try it Put that way back like that It might need help for you holding the ramp how bout you do you think that s a good idea I m gonna roll it back Alright Oh Is it gonna stay you think Yeah I bet Awesome Let s see how far it went Watch your foot 105 What is 105 105 I love the way that you re making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in So let s take a look Jacob let s look over here Let s look at our data we have the roll one with just the normal way we had 101 inches And then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches And roll three at 105 inches Which way went the furthest 103 roll three Roll three Why do you think that is Because it s 101 that one is 101 and that ones 105 Well why do you think roll one is different from roll three Because ones higher then the other higher then the other Because ones higher then the other Okay so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle I think we should What do you think we should pick Take away the girl Take away the girl Nothing What do you guys think about Hailey s idea What did she say Jacob S Hold on what did Hailey say Say it again We shouldn t even try Okay Okay so how about Jacob since Jacob was trying to make the other car how bout Jacob tries to put on bigger wheels We should see what happens then Here Jacob Well look at this look at which one would we need bigger wheels on That one That one Okay So that car Go farther that one will go farther Probably will go farther you think with bigger wheels Yeah Cause the bigger the wheel the easier it has balance Did you hear what he said Bigger wheels have balance The bigger the wheels the more balanced it is I m saying like let s say you re Is that gonna work Is there anything else you guys want to do to this car Or do you just want to change one thing I just change one thing Okay it s your car So what about your ramp Ashley what about your ramp how do you want your ramp to be Maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way Okay 76 You want to try that way Alright That s true Whoa That wasn t go far Alright let s measure It goes a little bit She needs a little bit of help 72 72 We re gonna put this vehicle Alright so we re not going to change the car but what could we do 32 Whoa look Student Guys this is going to be affecting weight okay That box could stay here instead of Alright you guys try it You guys got it now 91 times 2 Well that s up to your group Can I make my car now No not yet That s not weight three yet Split weight right now so How you guys doing Did you guys try to move the weight in different ways Ok Alright back Let s do it together 56 Look at that let s see what happened No it s 67 Where s your data at Put the data over here so we re all in the same place 83 Okay let s take a look What do you have here 67 This will be so much fun Okay you roll it Ashley can I work on it can I have it Should we take something away first No No 42 I think we should put a little one Gimme that You think we should I m not sure Cause the blue one Wow Cool Oh Oh my gosh Here I ll Yeah And without these wheels Now Are you ready Go Here here we go Ouchie hold the end I ll hold it 77 No it s 67 Jacob 67 Might be 77 What is 77 We did it for two ways so they can do it last way That was way more Yeah but How many inches was that second roll Look Three feet so 3 F So what three feet equals 36 inches We re going to be focused on the inches so we don t get confused So hold on wait a second When we had that ramp the first way what did you do with it the same way as the first way No we did this way Just that Yeah We haven t done it like that I know just re adjust this Yeah So when did it go when you did just that 30 seconds no it went that What is that 73 73 So then we moved it to make it which way did we do it the second way Higher We did it this way what happened to the numbers It went lower It went lower So if we go it lower it goes higher I don t know let s try So what s another ramp that we can make Have you tried that way before Nope Alright let s see Hold on a second David we have to measure Nope your group can help you measure Let s see 35 Ooh that s seven Okay let s take a look again let s make sure What s that There we go So roll three let s try Now let s take a look at our data hold on That s not gonna work You don t think so Well let s first take a look here and then we can see if that will work It s probably gonna fall What happened with roll three where s the data Look at roll three what is it 35 And what s roll two I don t know 36 So what do you think happened whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher I mean a little bit lower I m sorry It changed It changed What happened when it changed The number I see let s focus It goes more faster It might go more faster There s not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp and you guys wanna try that Yeah Okay let s see let s see what happens Taylor What happened It fell I knew it would my box Well how about you hold that so we can try it again Try it again Oh no Fix em and let s see if it does that every time do you think it ll do it every time Yes Yes Let s try again I ll measure this time You ll measure Yeah Oh Oh We have to do it again Taylor you can go on the carpet This time I made it lower Oh So he just said something what did he say He made it lower He made it lower So what s happening every time he makes it a little bit lower It falls off When it falls off it still can roll I mean just keep it rolling when it falls off Uh oh I ll measure it Okay We don t have enough space to measure that one how about we change the car and try again But what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed What happened when it was super high It fell apart It didn t work so well can you imagine if you were in a real car and you were going down something that steep Yeah No That would be kinda scary wouldn t it But as it kept going down what happened It didn t go off It didn t fall apart you re right Alright go back and try to make a different car Okay go back and try to make it be careful your gonna make me nervous Alright let s see Jacob what do you have Come on over Nope Jacob come on over What in the world did you make That looks like a Mack Truck Girls do you see this Yeah Tractors throwing in something Now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you Big Girls are you watching Look at how that rolled Girls you next Okay This was all my idea That was your idea I love it Could we try it this way We could keep a hold of that you might want to try it Let s see Well we should be working on Correctamundo See I got a good review What do we got Jacob 93 93 So what can we do to change it I guess we could maybe We re learning something We are learning something what did we learning We learned the car the littler it is the harder for it to fall That is true It s your turn Is that what you re finding out the smaller the car Yeah The smaller the car the more it picks up Picks up Cars go over Oh were we going over No I It s your turn Preston Oh did you guys hear him Let s take a second and listen He was talking about yesterday s experiment what did we do yesterday We tried rolling little cars on the carpet Why didn t it work out so well Jacob Little cars on the carpet Because the wheels stopped them Why did they stop you think Because the carpets too rough Because the carpet s too rough Did you guys find that too So what are you finding about today That the bigger the wheels the on hard surfaces It s faster on smoother and hard surfaces it goes further So what are you finding out about the ramp That You guys are finding that How about you decide that for this last one you tried one way with the ramp And now we re going to try two more ways with this ramp and I want to see if guys can figure out how this works better with a ramp 
 That they need to make some sort of a change Like the turning point Like there s a turning point There s some kind of change that needs to occur Do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change No I think some no In Fahrenheit 451 how some people were assuming that Mildred already knew but she just didn t want to not like accept it but not be part of it She didn t want to be part of the change she just wanted to be in tune with society She never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point Even when she had the opportunity she didn t Right I think emotion plays a big role in that too because Faber let fear get in the way of him doing something so he basically created that little earpiece thing so that somebody else could do it for him and he could watch over somebody that s actually doing it Another person who s carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is Beatty because although he had all of the knowledge much more knowledge than Montag had about society and everything he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it then what s the point if he s not going to gain anything out of it Do you think also because he has all that knowledge he wants to use it to have power Since he knows all that he wants to manipulate keep them in control keep them in check and stuff No I don t think it s that he wants power I mean it s that he s seen the bad side of things and like all humans you don t like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it With education he knows it s good because it helps you think outside of the box and everything but it s bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything Then you realize that there s genocides there s slavery there s wars there s too much negativity The government also doesn t want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go The more information they know the more possible ways they can use it against them I like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff because I guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people Vulnerable Vulnerable It s like if the people were the government s subordinates so it s not the government s people who they re protecting it s pretty much who they re in control of I kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing like in Harrison and bridge around again You get to see the emotion or what George has to go through but yet he doesn t do anything about it Harrison does It says right here His thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm It s showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head or whatever but Harrison is the one doing the actions He s the one that wants to go against the government and George isn t So do you think their relationship and the correlation of George and Harrison is just like Montag and Faber s where Faber doesn t want to do anything because he didn t want to go to jail in the South George doesn t want to go to jail because he doesn t want to lighten his own way because he would get what was it seven years Yeah For each sled that he takes out And Harrison is actually doing stuff And Montag isn t doing stuff So do you think that you need that person the one behind the scenes doing the stuff and then a person that s actually doing it or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill I think that you need people who are I think that you need people who are but I think that it s easier to so I think that way is better So you don t get in trouble I think the people that have the people in the front lines are always useful They are easier to camoflauge They are the ones with the real plans These people in the front don t usually come up with them Yeah but you have the plans and then you don t do it but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don t know how to use it Well not every body s that brave That s why you need to I think people need the support system like Faber was Montag s support system He had a plan Don t let him tell you he sees walk away walk away I guess here s my question So in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow I want you to think our question is to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws right created by government I know I m asking you to respond with to what extent should citizens comply with these unfair laws But we re also talking about so who should act right So who should be the one to act out to lead to go against the government Because we re looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out We re looking at people who have knowledge who have strength who are talented But they re not leaders And we re also looking at people who may not have those qualities they have the potential to have those qualities but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push So when we say to what extent should citizens comply do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody Or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices Do you even think that s fair that it s a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole I want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we ve seen a group of people whether it is a whole group or just a couple of people who take charge who lead and impact change Are there any examples that you can connect to that Do you think that that s even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people I see it as a way every time there s a change or a law or something that affects a certain group of people it s never really based on the whole group of people Like all citizens It s more of a target and when a certain group is attacked or targeted it makes others not really I don t want to say care but it doesn t really matter to them because they re not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that Or yeah it s just basically it s that group of people who have to I guess express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right but I think it s necessary for a unit You probably need that one person who spreads the message and then I think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it s going to be your turn So here s my question because on your AP exam on your final exam for your argumentative essays you have to be able to generate your own examples So I know Omar you ve got a very clear idea but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific and that s what you can discuss Let s see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific You want to say hey let s look at this specific example where this actually happened Any thoughts on that Anything with slavery with Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists in the north They really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and I guess that s where civil disobedience comes from is the abolishment of slavery Well the need to abolish slavery That it really wasn t really blacks or Africans or whatever you called them back then Wanting to be set free was people that weren t even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free And I think that s more important and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery They re not benefiting they re not getting negative from it so it s like you really think that it s wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation It s saying that it s wrong I want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that s going on right now because I guess maybe not a lot of you are aware but there s I don t know if you guys heard something about the green eye That recently that s in the past And I think that s very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but I guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in That kind of stops them and discourages them from to keep going So I guess that idea is I don t know it s kind of opressive because they re trying to maintain you in that little it s just marginalizing you and yeah I think it needs more support So I want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests right People were really protesting that and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against right And when we look at the questions to what extent should we comply with unfair laws If that is an unfair piece of legislation to what extent do you then choose to protest How far would you be willing to take it Because we talked about this this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion Like look at Harrison right Dancing on stage as a ballerina Doesn t really seem all that tough right But for him he was taking a big stance right Not about borderline violence right I want you to look at what Thoreau did He didn t pay his taxes He wanted to go to jail He was happy there He was like don t bail me out Had nothing to do with violence right You hear a lot of people protesting you know Issues regarding the DREAM Act but to what extent should they comply with the laws Do you use violence Do you even take it there Do you use more creative forms of protesting I want you to consider how far do you take it How far do you show your protest What is acceptable and where do you draw the line Good reaction lots of reaction Let s hear from people we haven t heard from I want you to go back and think about your goals that you set I m hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions chose goals that might push you to speak up So let s hear from a few folks that we haven t heard from yet and share the air time Any volunteer Jesus what do you think Like Omar said like the DREAM Act has an ill affect on a lot of people It doesn t really affect me but I know a lot of friends that it is affecting It s not really fair that it really didn t pass but when we want to try to push something like Julian said for slavery it didn t really take it took such a long time for them to really get the rights There was the abolishment there was Frederick Douglass during that time But as time went then came Martin Luther King who was the center person who started the really big move for African Americans to realize their own rights He lead the protests marches if you gather groups of people over time if you speak up with your voice people will hear Even people like African Americans they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal There should be rights and everyone no matter what color you are So for Latinos like us for the it s such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights but the dream that was once dead but even though it didn t pass people should not be put down like Aw it didn t pass So they ll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights cause if we stay together anything can happen If we stay together as one something will happen I am hearing two things and we ll get back to Stephanie really quickly I think she s just itching to get in this conversation I m hearing two things One that it takes a collective group effort It s not just one person but it needs to be many people involved As many people involved And I m also hearing that it takes a lot of time So those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws That s kind of like right now that it s kind of more modern because You think so no no no I want you take this idea that Omar brought this idea of mental slavery of oppression of our intellect our intelligence Is that something that you think is just recent Is that something that s been happening over time I want you to think about that and see we might isolate one part of the problem but I want you to think on a broader scale Is it really just one isolated event or is this one in a stream of events Stephanie you had something that you were Yeah all of them were in the governement and I was thinking of the movie Milk How they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in California and to be heard which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way But he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard One part in the movie that I ll always remember is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he s gay and all of that But he just hangs up but yet he does it for him most likely because he wants people like that to be heard And that s kind of what my connection is I think another historical event besides the slavery and what you just said is the nine eleven I think it s the short term one It took actually really quick the terrorists going up there It just took one simple idea to tell them Oh let s just go 
 Like a long A Not long A Long O No I ll give you a hint There s some letters up on the front What is the sound Er It s er Er Everybody say er Er Okay What we re going to do If you remember last week we looked at some pictures And when you heard the er sound what sound did you make Er No E R What did you make Tweet tweet Tweet tweet because a bird says tweet tweet and a bird has er So my first

kind of quick I m going to put this on top of this just for now okay Thanks You re welcome All right Let s see Let s see how fast we can get those out Let s see I m going to say we can do it in 40 seconds Let me help you out Let s put all these out so you can see them You have a lot of words Shh Okay We re not putting them down on the mat We re going to put them up here and then we re going to pull them down to the mat There we go Economics Shh All right Let s see if we made it Are we all done Yes ma am All right Give the students another point because you did it in enough time Okay Miss Dodd has the words up here also the word parts So first let s look at the ending parts okay What do you think this says Er Er Very good Look at this next one What does this say Urt Urt Eyes up here Eyes up here Good What does this say Er Good What does this say Urse And what does this say Erve Okay These are the same cards that you have so we re going to make some words okay Okay First we re going to start with urt U R T So let s pull that down to where it says rhyme U R T Okay And I want you to make the word hurt Hurt Good job All right Let s spell hurt together H U R T Hurt Very good All right So Miss Dodd will pull down my H and it looks like everybody got that Okay Now I want you to take your U R Pull down your U R Okay And this time I m going to give you a clue I want you to make the word that is something that is on an animal Covers an animal Keeps him warm His what We don t want our H right now Let s see if you can figure it out You should have U R right here okay And now we re going to So what was the answer to my clue Fur Fur Spell it F U R Fur Keep your U R and I want you to make the word spur Spur We talked about this word last week A spur Okay Yes Who put the things out I did Okay Who remembers what a spur is Something that you kick Very good Here s a picture of a spur Remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and

Let s see Let s look at this one What did you make Spir But what two letters actually say ur in spur I R Not I R Remember U R Yep Let s put it up here so we remember it Spur is S P U R I ve got another one All right Dirt Okay Oh yeah How do you spell dirt Oh yeah Wait Oh yeah We might not have that ending but do you know how to spell dirt D I R T Very good All right Let s move on to another one Oh I see that you have G I R Gir What were you thinking when you wrote that Can you use that in a sentence No Okay This one is not a word okay Now we re going to pull out our E R V E E R V E Let s see how quickly we can get it up You all are doing a good job You re all probably going to get another point E R V E Okay And I want you to fill in the blank The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food What can we put in front of the E R V E that would complete that sentence It s got to make sense All right What is this word Erve Let s see What if I were to put an S What word would I have Serve Serve Does that make sense in my sentence Do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food Yeah So what word did we come up with Serve Serve Very good

 I m not too sure if I like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it I m not too sure about that It makes it less It s different in an awkward way I don t know how to explain it It doesn t have any depth to it It has no dimension Like she s standing there he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then It looks like she s laying down Actually yeah it does I mean he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop And I m just not feeling it I like the Mick Jagger one but I m not feeling this Taylor Swift one See I like pop art I just I don t know Did you notice that What I thought it was a green that goes in to this That s on them it s more like a quiet like she s sleeping softness But I didn t notice it that it goes into purple periwinkle and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side Did you see that Then it goes in to two and he breaks off the colors And it s like All right let s take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions And then we ll talk about a whole group discussion and see what we all have and what we want to write In a sense it would be a good picture for the stance that she s in You know the title of the album is called Fearless and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless In the way she s standing The way he did it it just doesn t look like her It s like the wind s coming back and it pushes her hair Yeah but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera But then her hair wouldn t have been like that Yeah but they just need some big ole fans it s Hollywood You can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back You would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless You have to think It s more of country music I mean I could see if you were saying like hip hop pop And you get like all forceful What s Up I m here But they re saying you know she s a pop icon If she s a country artist then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts Because she s mainstreaming into the different areas she s creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys You wouldn t compare her to Kenny Chesney Those who want newer generation of country Right All right let s just try and get to our last question and then we ll talk about whole group and get you back in here Let s go ahead and start you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer if you want your input put in So let s just talk about the describe section What we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words What kind of words would you use to describe this piece Let s start with Mick Jagger Bold Bold Proud Proud Electric Electric Okay those are good ones What about Taylor Swift It s more feminine More soft It s pale it s delicate and Delicate Soft You said soft It s like he s almost scared when he s doing Taylor Swift compared to Mick Jagger Because Mick Jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere I think he almost makes Taylor look almost intimidated She s kind of pushing away The position and you have all these colors around her With the selection and Innocence Yeah I think we talked about that with Taylor a little bit You kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well Plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it like paints a picture She has an innocent expression I d say innocent yeah Okay Fierce You say fierce Okay It s like her personality she just breaks it out with this bold pose All right good So those are some good words key words to describe it So analyzing Let s figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss Colors Colors Color s a big one In both of them actually Paint strips The paint strips it looks like it s a lot of paint It kind of creates a lot of movement with the way that it s flowing through the pieces All right so our big ones are color He said in the video color is everything And that s his main focus is color The different colors make the value in the picture the dark colors make the darker shades and light colors He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger than he did in Taylor And like the contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more loud I d definitely say it s louder Okay good Let s discuss the movement a little bit So if you look at it I see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair I like how the hair is like that and I like her position from the side because I think it adds interest Like I was saying a second ago if she was looking straight forward I don t think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side And that s just my personal opinion but I like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it s creating the movement through the piece And then with the Mick Jagger one the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me How he chose the green and the red to contrast each other I think that s big bold move in this area Good Now what are our focal points Faces Faces And what are the big things that factor in for that Why is that What did he do The colors around her make her pop The colors surrounding If you look the face is white right here and then her skin tone is pale as well So that kind of pops out against the bold colors What do you guys think about the materials The silk screen and the acrylic paint You guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars and just dipped in a couple different ones And just started coloring So what do you guys think about his process and the materials he uses He doesn t really choose what direction he just kind of goes with the flow It s very free if you watch him Mindless Mindless creativity He does what comes to him which is interesting Any other comments about the actual process or materials I think It would have been more amazing if he didn t use the silk screens So you d rather him just paint it than add the silk screen I think it would be more like a wow factor And some of his pieces are just paintings More of the people though like the Rollins he painted And the ones he did for President Obama President Reagan some of the Statue of Liberty And also some of the other people like Aerosmith and the Beatles as well And he s usually famous for painting his faces And he would go into the color 
 What part of soccer you really want to know What about the measuring or even the measure That s what you ve got to figure out Or how long you can Okay I mean how many like times you can do it Okay so you could sit there and count how many bounces kicks or you could sit here with the timing How much you can do it and how much time you need Okay how many per minute So you ve got lots of ideas You re going to have to choose that Do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other Yeah Okay so I think you have both come up with all four of you You guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one And you ll collect your data and you ll collect your data and then present it as a company How about that soccer team or company Alright Alright you ve got a good name Alright that s part of it It works Catch your attention I know Stephanie We re having trouble Because we barely decided on it We didn t do the friction one but the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle The little car that you pull back and see how far it goes Okay And the parachute one so I thought of the parachute one What do you think Yeah You re a team on it okay So what are you going to measure with a parachute Pardon Yeah you re going to use metric which is centimeters Stephanie s got control of the metrics So can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes Well we don t know how far Because we know we can t throw it out the window Oh no It s too far Okay but you know what Maybe on the counter You guys are coordinated I would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights How high you could You could do some test runs right Yeah Don t you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision Okay Yeah And you know what If you d like if we have time I want you to do test runs in here but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear That s what I was thinking Okay but I do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final But make your hypothesis what you re thinking because I think you re on a roll here It s going to be good I don t like his interview So how far In this experiment can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something Okay I think you re making another experiment right So what s your first experiment Just how fast it would drop by itself How fast from one distance Yeah Okay so one distance you re going to see how fast it ll drop And then you re going to compare that to from that distance Adding weights to it Okay alright Well I wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights Okay so she s got one experiment and you ve got another one Do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together You do yours and you do yours Because you only can change one variable at a time right Yeah So what s your variable you re going to measure I m going to measure the distance how far How high different distances And what are you going to do And you re going to time it right Yeah Okay and you re going to do what s your variable that you re going to change The weight Okay But you re going to see how fast it drops Yeah Alright so I think you re going to need another paper Okay Because you ve got two experiments going Are you going to support each other in each one Yeah That s pretty cool double points How are you guys doing Oh I like it Okay tell me about this one Okay so we re going to get two or three different size basketballs like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then Yeah And then we re going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there So like how high it bounces depending on its size Oh so the size of the balls to see how High it bounces Okay If it bounces higher What do you think I think the small one will bounce higher Because there s less material to like have to drop from there Like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn t go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher So based on your observations You re a good observer So your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would Whoa are these your averages Yeah they re my averages Wow okay Good So how are you guys going to present it as a team She s probably going to do like what we thought would happen And I m probably going to do the results of what actually happens Are you comfortable with that Uh huh Okay to make it really clear what you did Yeah yeah Okay I think that ll be really good because this is great this is great to show and then you re writing your conclusion with numbers in it I like that And then you told yours was rejected right Yeah Okay now does that mean you re a failure No Do you guys mind going first Sure Because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment I think that might give them some confidence and it ll take the pressure off them because they don t really want to go first Okay so let s go Aqui tenemos que cambiar la friccion sobre dos Tenemos que cambiar Oh wow the graph looks good And your data chart looks good So Jenni will you shows yours On the first dictation thing when we have to go up there do we have to go up by step like show everything What do you think Or just show our graph What do you think would be the best I say showing the graph Should we show like our question and then should we show the whole thing What do you think I don t know I think so Showing both Okay But it s probably the most important thing to convince them I d definitely show your data Okay we ll show his because it s better than mine Okay very good And let s see yes it looks professional So these numbers How many times did you do this experiment Three times wait four three twelve 100 I don t know Because there s five and there s three Okay We ve got one two three four five trials here Is that correct No we went up three but he wrote trials for these Oh okay So we can fix that Que dibujaste No tienes que poner esto Tienes que poner esto It s very neat So you added one two three and divided by By three Okay alright that s how you got the average Yeah Okay and who figured out the answer Me Jenni Wow Jenni We did was it highest to lowest Yeah Highest minus lowest divided by two Awesome You definitely should show this And then this would be uncertainty Yeah And these are the mounted distance with different kinds of What are these five things The shoes Okay The shoes It gets tiring when you have to do it three times Right Now my question is if you didn t have the shoes how did you get the data for it I did it at my house You did them at your house Okay And then what s this one right over here The socks Okay and that s one you definitely did at school Yeah we did it here and we also did the Vans here And the Vans Alright so that s good Would you explain that to the class Yeah That these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error Yeah because of the surface Like at his house it would have been not like floor it would be carpet or something like that Yeah what s your floor like where you did it Well I had to do it like outside during the rain Oh my goodness Okay so you ve got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any Yeah Okay maybe it would And so what would a scientist do in the next time Would have done it in a dry place Yeah do it in a dry place Yeah I like that Okay so you ll tell that for the next time Yeah But I really liked how you guys didn t give up How you actually did the socks compared to your Vans And you know how you pull those out what are research we could have done your boot Oh yeah my boot Yeah I could have Want to do my boot No I m good No My legs are tired Okay I m sure they are Well did you accept or reject your hypothesis Accept We accepted it And tell us why Because You ve got the evidence right there don t you The experiment like that one question we had it goes with the real world or something like that Could you repeat this experiment The whole thing Yeah or could anybody do this experiment Yeah it s easy It is Did you write your procedure so it s easy It s hard to write a procedure because it Okay and if you had to do this experiment over again would you do it any differently or not No Would you test for anything else Good point How much pressure right Okay alright any other questions Nice job Thanks Jenni s team Sorry to rush you guys but we got the idea What was your experiment Our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk uses four different pairs of shoes like Adidas Converse or Vans The Adidas would go the farthest The Vans No just show the data You were correct And you were correct because the Adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116 6 centimeters We accepted our hypothesis Jenni continue this Why me Because you re professional Well we were going to do an interview but we forgot to So what do we do It s really bad Why do you think it s bad Jenni I don t know Esta bien esta bien Well here s the amount of distance and here s the kind of and I marked them as the average they all went So we can see that the Adidas went more than the Vans did because the Vans were like the lowest Will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting Because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again Oh yeah Well it s because Jose did half of the experiment he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and I think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry So I think that affected the experiment There s probably different traction on shoes Si Simon What kind of shoe would you try next time A boot Oh like my major walking boot Si Alright What would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot If you look at the Well because it s soft so I think it ll go farther Possibly go farther Okay alright That would be interesting to try out Does everybody see how this can apply to real life Tienen preguntas Hablan en ingles no espanol Can you explain how this would apply to real life if you aren t just moon walking Jose Jenni Don t look at me I don t know Go on the actual moon Gym class Yeah gym class Does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class Sometimes Okay some people do I don t You don t Yeah like these shoes they slide a lot like in the gym Okay so it might be different shoes for different jobs Yeah Okay well thank you Nice job Good we have time for our last presentation Thank you Alright sorry to rush everybody I know you could talk more about it Thanks for being a good audience Hello class how are we doing today Good So our title was dirty water versus clean water Thank you Our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water

huh We still got one more thing to do Four bags Isn t that right Ms Moore That s right Caleb Only two more There s like one bag and then three in there Let s see you make some ice cream Shake it and eat it Yeah About 30 seconds of shaking Yeah it looks cool Why you think we put rock salt in ice It makes the flavor Oh it s so cold It keeps ice from melting It does keep the ice from melting Very good Is it cold Anne Carol What happened to that We have like this ice cream maker and we like put in it and then we turn it on and it makes good My turn Alright I m gonna get this My hands are gonna cold I m gonna try to get the bag in the center Why you think I m rubbing my hands so they can get warm Do you think it s a solid yet Rub your hands Rub your hands Your turn It s gonna take a little while Yeah you can warm your hands up Because what s gonna happen if our hands are warmer It makes more warm Yeah it s gonna make it easier isn t it Alright you keep making that ice cream I m gonna go check on the other group okay Help each other Help each other Pass it on to Thomas Hey Thomas It s on the side we have to get it in the middle And the other kind needs to get cold Oh Oh it s so cold Caleb My turn please My turn No you already did it My turn It s my turn now It s starting to look like it It s mixed together Oh my goodness Whoa that s cold You think it s gonna turn into a solid Is that what s gonna happen Solid and liquid A solid and liquid Yeah because it melts Oh if it melts it s gonna be a Liquid Do you think that is a gas Anne Carol No What do you think it is A solid A solid It could turn into a liquid Do you think that an ice cube Hold on Amy s got a good question What did you say Maybe sometimes it could turn into a gas state How would you turn it into a gas Boil it You boil it Very good It could melt too and turn into a It could turn into one as it melts My house is a solid Your house is a solid Anne Carol Good job It s so cold Shake it shake it Give it a good shake Alright I ll be right back guys Try not to squeeze it then it might pop Ms Moore Yes ma am Will you do it please You want me to help you Okay Let s re check it and see Have to open a lot of bags What is it still Liquid So we re get it right in the middle You wanna feel it Whoa It s still a liquid Is it getting colder Yes It did mix together didn t it We re gettin there It does look like that now doesn t it That s okay Alright ready guys We re gonna get it more in there There s like 50 pieces of ice in there There is a lot of them Alright here goes your turn Kevin Getting colder

 Please freeze for a moment Gentlemen what did you think about your performance I wouldn t say terrible but were you accurately on pitch all of you No No Like as soon as the ladies came in you were like Whoo and then you forgot what you were singing Okay So don t let them distract you They re trying They re trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off But hold firm men Hold firm to your position All right Let s try it again Here we go Sing noel sing noel noel noel Lock it in Sing noel sing noel noel noel Two parts Sing noel sing noel noel noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Together Sing we all noel The support Sing we all noel Two parts Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Back to the beginning Sing noel sing noel noel noel End song All right If you were going to give yourself a grade what would you give it Alison As a class Like out of A s and B s and C s Yep I would give an A minus Okay and why the minus What do you think we think need to improve The pitch was kind of off at some parts Okay So there was maybe some pitch issues What about energy level It was okay but this But one of the things about African music is it is something that is like felt in their soul Okay It is traditionally when you listen I mean they are just letting it You know when we see any of the performances or listen to any of the CDs we ve listened to it s just very gut felt I feel like you re Sing noel sing noel noel noel So This is so pretty Yes we want SING NOEL SING NOEL NOEL NOEL Especially on that Sing we all noel That s me We re singing It s like you re telling people We are singing Not Sing I think we all noel Okay So let s make sure that we re right there on that One more time See if you can get a little more weight to your sound I don t mean make it flat I just mean with more confidence more security more support Okay Here we go Sing noel sing noel noel noel Awesome Sing noel sing noel noel noel Two part Sing noel sing noel noel noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Support this Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Good And stop there So you get the idea That was awesome Did you hear the difference Yeah Awesome I love that you challenged yourselves You pushed yourselves there It s hot Those notes are kind of high I know that And you just pushed right through it So good job Let s review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time So I m going to come here so we can do our body percussion Real quick We are going to start with our bass part Ladies and gentlemen we are not going to use these right now because traditional African music is by rote meaning you learn it by hearing You learn it by doing If you are a visual learner these are our music stands by the instruments so this will help you And you know I want everyone to be successful so you use the tools that will help you be successful You be an independent learner where you decide If this is what you need grab a music stand Okay If you don t you don t need it Okay So there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick Okay So basses first Let s all kind of scoot over this way So bass section first We have starting with your left hand Sing oh sing oh sing noel Sing oh sing oh sing noel And you have that crossover Sing oh sing oh sing noel Everybody feel comfortable with that Any questions You look good You look like you have it All right Then we have the xylophones This one s a tricky one So we have for that part Let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time So we have Sing noel sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Okay So the trickiest part is how many G s All right So remember we have low C and high C So you have C C C C C C And there s four Gs over that syncopated rhythm G G G G F E D Okay So it s kind of like One two three down the ladder you go Okay So let s try that C C C C C C G G G G F E D C C C C C C G G G G F E D Got it Got the idea All right Then we go on to the glockenspiels And for that one we can just clap that rhythm because I think on the instruments it will be easier to see to show because they re so obviously a little so it s not really like that So here we go It goes Sing oh yes sing noel noel Sing oh yes sing noel noel Sing oh yes sing noel noel Okay Got the idea for that rhythm So I will come over and help that section and some of you may remember that from last time Then we have our percussion section Okay We have first the conga drum A real quick review on conga drum playing Everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you If we can kind of spin back here so I can show you When you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit And scoot over that way There we go So when you play conga drum you actually are going to hold it in between your legs and put your feet around the base and you re going to tip it out from you So that that way the sound can come out but you also have the correct play style Remember pat on the ends when you re playing And those are in You can pat this on your lap as well Right now practice on your fingers Okay So here s on this Practice with a good technique right now Ready Go This is the part of the conga drum All right You ve got the idea And that goes over and over each measure Then we have the log drum And the log drum And again the parts are right here on the stand if you need them You re going to have One side you re going to play Sing So basically And it doesn t matter with those Sing noel sing noel sing noel Okay So you can clap that real quick Sing noel sing noel sing noel sing Okay See how it fits Hello Welcome Thank you very much All right So Next we are going to have this part which is traditional African bell And this one you have Rest rest rest noel Sorry hi to low So it s Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel rest Can you snap it Noel Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel And you can try it Rest rest rest Hi and fast Noel Rest Get them up Noel Rest rest rest noel Yes Ladies and gentleman I m always spot checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we re doing this It s really important that I see that participation Because then when we go to pick parts I m looking to see who has it Yes there s choice but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing Okay So let s try it again Ready Go Rest rest rest Rest rest rest Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel You got it And then I love these shakers You are the pulse You are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song So it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together So again really important We might add in some other more African instruments They re kind of loud so we ll see if you can get the correct sound So what I d like you to do now Do you have any question All right If you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time I would challenge you to maybe pick a different one Okay If you were still working on it you re welcome to stay there But without any payoffs so just kind of selection I would like you all to go and pick an instrument part Remember we have glockenspiels basses xylophones and percussion So open Two glockenspiels open and a bunch of xylophones open Who was there first Who was there first between you and Ellen I was here You were there Okay So if you want to join the glockenspiels you can do that You can go to xylophones Oh nobody s up to the challenge All right Once you get there you can start practicing All right Hold up everybody All right Thank you Since we re trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually if you have the green mallets would you especially for you guys switch them out with the felt mallets instead So here s a set Well you need those for that as well So we have one There should be another one in there Oh here right here Nope those are green You don t want those Oh here s another one right here Here here you go here s a set That s awesome Thank you Because that s just going to make it a lot softer and not quite as angry sounding All right So let s listen to each part so you can know what you re listening for Remember when you are playing in an ensemble like this if you can t hear the other parts what does that tell you You re playing too loud Yes you re playing too loud And remember again texture is everything We want to be able to pull out the different parts so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that But for right now let s make sure that we can keep it soft Okay It s not a competition All right No one s going to win It s the whole class that we re trying to do this together So if we hear bass part first And let s go ahead and add at least shaker for right now and then we ll build in one or two sections One two ready go Okay Time out So you re listening for the beat She s watching me instead of the basses right Because you re doing their work a little bit and you need to keep it nice and steady What happened we ended up with three different tempos Did you hear that One two ready go Okay Pretty good And then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are Okay One thing that will help is adding the singing to it Okay 
 We gotta work quiet It s three and a half inches long and is it Seven centimeters Keep going gotta keep going Wait wait wait wait wait It s probably about one pound Okay yeah let s go I don t know how You measure it with this inches then centimeters One inch That s one inch One inch Yeah then do it across We need one inch one and a half One and a half Three and a half You got it It s a bone got a bone Pick it up It d be easier if we could pick it up Here s a bone There s one yeah You all let s put it in the middle We gotta tear it apart now We don t have to tear it apart even more It s a bone It s part of that Wait hold on hold on and feathers You all start pulling those ones It s on my finger There s a ball It s a bird it s a bird No look at this claw It s a bird it s a bird It s a birdy bird Look there s its wait where s its There s its teeth and there s its It s a skull You all be careful with those little ones Just broke it Oh my god I found something You guys are being mean A skull I found a skull right there How many skulls did you all predict would be in your owl pellet I put one One How many have you found so far Was it right We found a couple bones What about skulls how many skulls It s tiny Alright how can you determine what kind of animal it is How much did it weigh Ten grams Ten grams Do you think do you think its weight has anything to do with how many skulls inside Why would that have anything to do with Because the skull might weigh about two grams maybe I think here s another skull It s got a lot of bones in it Okay see if you can determine what animal it is Looks kind of like a teacup This is a rat skull because I can see its teeth right here I know Jake found another skull I think This is a skull This is so cool Let s get playing boys and girls You all I think this is what we got No that is a bone No look look Where s the claw And look at this claw I think it s the same And then look Look let s see Oh that s a skeleton Oh that is a skeleton Ooh my touching it A whale Ooh yay we found a skeleton Look at the skeleton Chloe It s a skull It s a skull Ew ew ew ew ew Put the feathers and stuff over here Or whatever it is Yeah we need to the feathers Look this is soft It s not soft it has something There s a little baby bone It looks like a squirrel Look I got a baby bone No seriously What animal did you predict you would find in your owl pellet A bird A bird a gopher and a rat So what have you have you decided what it is A bird How did you determine it was a bird We found like big claws like this How can you be sure that it s a bird claw Because these are usually as hard and like sharper We put this Oh we got the skull and we got a skull How many animals how many skulls have you found We only found like two This is what I was thinking You know how it has sharp stuff up there What s a way that you can determine what it is I think we got a bird we got some more claws However much bones you find Compare the bones that you found to the bones on the chart I found another skeleton Keep working It has to be a bone this might be something right there Let me get that out because I haven t got anything out yet We got two skulls I found something I found this Another skull Yeah I think Found another bone You did Yep We found all sorts of here s another this is a claw It s a bird Is this a bird claw or I don t know I think that s a Where s the bird skull Found something What is it Wait hold on wait I think we ll find another skull What do you think this is Daniel What do you think this is I don t know Know what that is I bet that s probably something I think this bone might be something found in its arm You all look what I found I think this is a skull right here because We got them two don t worry We got a bone we got a bone We got the same skeleton Have you determined what your animal is No we don t know I think this is an eyeball We got a bunch of eyeballs Here let me see that Look look look It s a tooth Eyeball Let me see Look I found this This is the part of the eyeball Look look I found the Ew I found the pelvis I found the pelvis The owls are on this chart I think that might be something wait With the tweezers Here s an eye socket Over there somewhere This is this I think We need to get the hair out of it Oh my word I think we got Look I got the head See how sharp these are 
 Plug in two You got it We got it All right First question is Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to your partner no Let s try that one more time folks eyes up here What was the rule on the darts The rule is don t do anything until you say so Thank you Don t act until I say so Go Yeah There could be a little bit left of potential Is that what you mean Yeah Well All right On three I m going to need eyes up here please One two th Don t flip your card until I tell you to I shouldn t be able to tell what your card is It should be much more secret They re colored guys I can tell what they are Okay Here we go on three hold up your card please One two three Okay We ve got mostly disagrees And then we have very one confident Oh we disagree So here s what we re going to do Put your cards down I m calling on Mark first So where should we be looking Mark At Mark Okay Okay So I strongly disagree because say So you know you when you You know how you eat food you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running And then you re out of energy you re tired you go to bed you wake up the next morning it comes back You eat more food and it comes back Okay So you re getting it from a different source Yeah Okay but that energy you have originally So that initial energy that you have and then you ran Does it go away Yeah you have plenty more but does that original energy go away No Where does it go Because you still don t have it right You have to eat more food This is supposed to be challenging Great job Who has another idea Or who can tell me where does it go It s awfully quiet Awfully quiet What do you got I don t think it literally Well I don t think it goes anywhere You just It just keeps making more It makes more So the energy I burnt right So I m running and I m running and I m running Where does it go Out Out where To the air To the air in what form Breath Now this is tricky This is where it gets tricky Breath is made of what Vapor Carbon dioxide Water and carbon dioxide And we call that matter We call that stuff Is stuff and energy the same thing No No and this is really a tricky idea in Science So we re going to keep working with you on that So where does the energy go Out into sweat Out into Now okay sweat is Stuff It s stuff right But where So where does the energy go Does anybody want to change their answer And say once it s used up it s used up for good Anybody Some people I think Now Tatum what do you think I think that when you run it s Some of the energy go into the ground How many people agree with Tatum That some of that energy is going to go to the ground Oh yeah Yeah Okay In what form does it go to the ground In static stuff What s that I think you said static stuff Is that what you say Yeah Okay so static stuff is Now this gets really tricky because now we re getting into electrons But you re thinking about the rubbing kind of thinking Is that what you re thinking How it rubs And then you shock people Okay So that can happen That s a little more complicated so I m going to put that on hold for now But what So if I m running and that energy s going into the ground somebody said that Who said that Tatum Tatum Okay So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground In what form is it going into the ground Yeah Energy transfer It is an energy transfer right This is going from my foot to the ground What form is it in Do you guys know what I mean when I say form Yeah Yeah We talked about kinetic and potential and heat and what else we talked about Elastic and Light Gravitational and light and chemical Sound Heat sound Ooh there s just hey is any of that sound energy No No Maybe it could be sound energy Yes Sound Because you re You re stepping hard You re Okay so if I m running I m probably going to produce some sound Anything else that could go in there Jason Huh Okay I think that as you step on You ll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on you all react to gravity to the ground So gravity s pushing down now remember what gravitational energy is is how far it is away from the ground right So how much room it has to fall basically So would there be If I go like this would there be any gravitational energy there Wouldn t there be if you raise your foot Now it s got gravitational Here s what we need I m really doing something to say But here s what I want you to think about this one Actually let s do this one more time I want you to re vote on this Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to each other for 10 seconds You re thinking it s going someplace else I don t know where but I don t think it just disappears for good I think it s going somewhere That it s somewhere but just not sure where Yeah All right folks we re going to re vote on three One two three All right put your cards down for just a second Here s what Henry just said and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry And we re going to talk about again guys we re not getting answers to all these questions today we will at some point I promise We re going to do it in the formal labs but not before I m through telling you Henry tell me what you just said I think that it s not gone for good I m not sure where it goes but I think it doesn t just leave It s still somewhere but I don t know where How many of you agree with Henry That you think that it s somewhere but you re just not sure where I don t know where though All right Do you know what form No No Anybody else Know where But wait Doesn t it just transform It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be What What kind of energy is it All right but here s what we re going to do we re going to move on to the next one If a person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out Ready set go What s the evidence that the box has energy What form of energy is that that s moving I don t know Well it s kineck kineck One more try Kinetic Okay Because it s currently in motion Yeah Okay All right So now here s what I want We re going do a challenge question What about the person What kind of energy does the person have who s pushing it That I don t know You guys all have it Okay here we go Eyes over here please Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement All right here we go A person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out On three hold up your cards please One two three So what you re saying then is you all think the box does have energy am I correct Yeah Okay Chloe tell me why What is your evidence that the box has energy I think it has energy because when you re pushing it it has a friction with whatever you re pushing it How many of you agree that there s friction there Because it s rubbing against what The ground It s rubbing against the ground There could be some rubbing against you but most likely it s going to be rubbing against ground But here s my question what is your evidence that it has energy It does have friction and now it gives you some sort of indication that it s doing what Moving It s moving What do we call that something s moving What kind of energy does that Just shout it Kinetic Kinetic So it has kinetic energy So here s my next question so does anybody disagree The box does not have kinetic energy Tate I didn t believe it I thought it was transferred I thought that it was energy transfer Yeah Okay So you think energy s being transferred from the person to the box Yeah Okay but the question is still does the box have energy Even if I m transferring it there Does it have energy while it s moving Yeah Well do you mean before the person I mean while I m moving it I m in the process of pushing the box Does the box have energy Yeah but don t you think part of it would be from you and part of it I think all of it is from you Oh But does it still have energy Yeah Yeah it does So what s your proof Chloe just said it What s your proof that the box has energy Friction It s moving That it s moving Okay now the friction is proof that s it s moving perhaps But you also see it moving that would be the proof that it s moving Okay so here s my other question I m going to make this point this is too easy for you We re going to make this more challenging What about the person pushing the box So here is me this is how I push a box So if I m pushing the box what kind of energy do I have Think about it Jack what do you think Kinetic How many of you agree with Jack that I have kinetic energy How many of you think there s something else going on there as well No So I have I can only have kinetic energy right Because I am Moving Pushing Because I am moving and I m pushing Okay What other kind of energy must I have I have to say something else like it s kind of helping to and what disagrees Yesterday you told us the classic pool You re talking about energy transfer You guys know what she s talking about We re talking about the pool and handle Yeah I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the because you have the stick in your hand and you have the energy potential energy and then you start moving it and then it s kinetic and it goes through the stick and through the ball and it moves So you re saying that I have some form of potential energy as well Yeah before you start And then In what form is that potential energy Because I think Emily was about to say this too Think about this guys Where am I getting my energy from Is it gravitational No Muscles Okay so I ve got my muscles I ve got my body But where s that energy coming from Food Which is a form of what Marcus Fuel Which is a form of what Potential Time out We re asking Marcus Marcus what form of potential energy is fuel Um This is hard Did you want a lifeline Yeah Anika can you help him out Chemical Chemical right Make sense Yes Okay All right we re going on to the next slide Are you ready Yeah Woo hoo hoo Okay here we go Now goodness gracious Okay this is a hard one Cold moves faster than heat Ready set go And but also I remember my mom on hot days she s like Don t go upstairs because it s hotter Heat rises So is it is it move So your evidence that it s moving faster is that it goes up Yeah and also when you put it in hot hot water it s looser because Okay so you re saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well Yeah Faster than heat Okay How about moving in other directions other than up Is there Do you have any Wind Okay so that would So does one move faster than the other Tatum what do you think All right Think about it All right here we go Okay here we go So on three hold up your answers please One two three We ve got strongly agrees We ve got an in between We ve got an ooh we ve got a strongly agree And we ve got a couple in betweens All right We re mostly in orange land we ve got one green So here we go You ready Yeah And stand together you re going to back them up Yeah So okay so we agree that Are you sure No Just kidding Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain So you re a strongly disagree Okay Well I read it wrong I thought it said heat Yeah I thought it said heat moves faster than cold Okay so tell me why you strongly disagree then Tim Well because there s just as heat rises So it has to be lighter to move And so it must be moving faster Yeah How many of you agreed with this How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing Interesting And how many of you Nope you guys it never crossed your mind Okay Let s hop to another Tatum do have anything else to add to that No What is your evidence that cold moves slower Because he was just saying heat was rising do you have any evidence that cold would move slower Let s see Alex what do you think Well because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules they move faster when they re hot The coke can Yeah the coke can investigation Okay so I m going to ask them for specific evidence So what was your specific evidence in the coke can the hot molec that they were moving faster Well there was steam coming out of it and then in the solid everything s Molecules in solids are super slow And then as they move on to liquid then gas they move faster Okay And then you need heat to make liquid into gas How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold So let me ask you a question and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds then we might move on let s see What is cold Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold What is the idea of cold or coldness Okay think about it for a second Ellie what is cold Well it s like It could be water that s frozen in I was thinking that heat moves faster than than cold because if something was frozen the molecules wouldn t be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that Oh then it might be Okay so she gave me an example of what is cold But is coldness So what what does that even mean What does that even mean Anna Shivering What s that Shivering Okay shivering is because you are cold What is coldness Okay I think it s when the temperature is really low and everything s kind of darkness when you think of the sun warm it s really warm when you have the sun But it s when you think of something cold it s sometimes Okay I want You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is Here s what I want to think about Okay how to phrase this Is there a such thing as cold And if so how would you define it It s a hard question Oh You got to answer Get ready to answer Get ready and do one quick response and then we re going to put it aside for now and we re going to move on Come on Hunter No because it s just heat that s a That s just water that can be heated or Heat heat is cold Heat is that Yeah it s like Heat that s cold Yeah Oh So it s all just kind of a scale Like you got hot over here and cold over here and you re talking about there s less heat over here than there is here Heat has cold molecules Heat has colder All right So here s what we re going to do we re going to talk more about this later We re going to move on to the next question for now Here we go 
 Gina I wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids example Alka Seltzer Maalox and Tums can effectively neutralize Okay so far we ve been listening to this are we talking mostly the same equipment same supplies Yeah Right Maybe some beakers maybe some pipettes and some base Right Okay is this similar to Juan s This one is right So maybe we can start grouping these two together Christina The goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective Tide Clorox or OxyClean by determining which is most basic Any concerns Yeah Adrian How do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic Maybe there s some other factors that go into that and they re it s just basic ness Juan That some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors I mean Some of them have safety warnings that say like don t get too close to the vapors that come out Okay so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn t use them Is that what you mean Yeah Okay okay we use them in our homes but don t bring them to school right Yeah I m a little concerned too about your idea that it s about which one is most basic Okay Cause the active ingredient in Clorox I think is bleach and bleach Sodium hypochlorite Is sodium hypochlorite Which has a pretty interesting smell I d stay away from that And then we have Tide right Tide is not bleach all right I m not sure what the actual detergent active ingredient is but I m pretty sure it s not bleach So this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test and that it makes sense why we re testing it Okay All right we ll come back to this And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays so it doesn t matter it wins anyway I think he died didn t he Yeah he did it s too bad You know that guy must have made so much money I better not complain Adrian Go ahead I will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory To do this I ll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker I ll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate After as much precipitate as possible has formed I ll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected Any ideas Jimmy I m kinda wondering why it s important to you like you said to make the lab meaningful Yeah it should be So Adrian do you have a response It s just cause bottles that don t have molarity kind of annoy me and I feel like I should there should be like a label that says the molarity I just kinda You know my room is open fifth period every day you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations I don t have a free fifth period After school s fine too That s cool that s cool What concerns me is I thought the theme was titration right Is the theme titration Okay where is the titration aspect to this Do you know what I m asking here Yeah I know I just didn t realize Because you re mixing you re doing a precipitate reaction everybody see it that way I think you re doing a precipitate reaction and so I just feel like you know this you had the wrong theme going on here Anyway we ll move on Nicholas Artel Artel Sirhan Sirhan although he was a bad man though I think right He was accused of being a bad man Go ahead The goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more Vitamin C per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate crush them dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it I would also use a pH sensor to see what the solution to see when the solution is at seven to see when it s neutralized Doing this will let me know which company I should buy from for my Vitamin C pills What do you guys think Vitamin C is ascorbic acid I don t know if you wrote that Did you No okay so if it s an acid you can titrate it right Is anybody concerned about like anything here Jimmy Don t the pills tell you how much Vitamin C is in them Like the bottle Wait let me make sure if you buy a Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of Vitamin C my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets and you crush it and you do this experiment it s gonna be close to that 100 milligrams So are you testing because you think they re not accurate Yeah Oh Okay so you re testing for accuracy on their part just to keep them honest Because I mean 100 milligrams it s kind of a non specific number All right Ian Actually another way you could look at it is that just because it says 100 milligrams that s how much of the Vitamin C is in it that s not how big the tablet is Being that sometime I mean you could have and say just arbitrary numbers you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin C or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it actually had more stuff in it per density Okay but is that what you want him to do I thought are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100 you don t care how big this tablet is unless unless what s the danger here Some of that other that tablet contains acids or bases in them then that would affect your results right One of them I have is pretty pure it s pretty much just ascorbic acid the other company I have does have some other stuff in it so I was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly Vitamin C Have you ever been to like the CVS and looked in the section I mean I could find one I just haven t There s a bunch you could even What d you guys figure out It s turning yellow Why do you think it s doing that Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic I didn t think it would be that big of a deal because Wait Hang on so you mean so far what you ve done is you ve crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue Yeah And that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want That s right That s what you re saying Yeah What color should it be Blue I guess It s kind of green It just looks as if this coloring is just green dye Have you thought about using like phenolphthalein That has a distinctly pink color otherwise it s clear No we did not think of that You wanna try that Yeah Yeah that d be better So the phenolphthalein is gonna be it s probably going to be behind If it s pink it s acidic right No if it s basic Do the bubbles matter All right could I just stop and ask you guys did you guys get your color change you were looking for Yeah So the titration is working out Yep Very clean What So tell me what you got here This is a disinfecting Clorox we re just starting out we re just trying to measure out 10 milliliters That one we re done with we got it to the brown like it didn t stir anymore that was it That s as far as it went We put in 61 and that was it Now we re going to start this one And that worked with the one molar So is this oh so this is a different concentration Or how is this one different this is just a different This is a different type and it s a different percentage of the hypochlorate That s disinfecting spray and that s bleach With a different type of Clorox cleaning product All right Did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous No we did not make sure But they re I just wanna you know we don t wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here When we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing And this was fine like it said it should be done in basic and everything Okay God bless you Excuse me How s everything going Not good with this one What s in there It s red wine vinegar But it hasn t changed color The treatment s too powerful Yeah we re thinking it s too So we re gonna do the white What s the solution to that then Why don t you just use less Less of the vinegar Right All right So we use five milliliters instead of Well I mean right If you use less then don t you think you ll be able to titrate it Easier Well you d need less base to get there Right Okay Let s go over here see what happens over here So squeeze that out What are you guys so you ve got Vitamin C crushed in there you used is this bromothymol blue what did you use Yeah we used BTB and now we re gonna see how much base we used Just out of curiosity why did you use a graduat what is this about 50 You didn t want to use like Cause that is are you gonna All the other ones were like dirty Yeah they were kinda And I think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment s limit All right coming along okay it looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hi You re adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue Yeah Is that too much Well has it occurred to you and it probably hasn t it s okay bromothymol blue itself is either a weak my guess is it s a weak acid it could be a weak base but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases So we always want to use a bare minimum amount Therefore how about if you use something that has a distinct color change roughly at the neutral point like phenolphthalein Cause then it ll go from pink your This is acid These are acids so they ll go from clear to a pinkish color Okay okay but do you think the pink will be able to be seen Well Like the blue one You know the blue you need to use a lot more to get there although I don t know I suppose since you already did this one I mean we could remeasure out You may wanna well we don t want to run out of time here so right Stay consistent and then consider it how you can make improvements later Okay All right Now that s very nice You guys have questions What was your results in comparing what the company says and what you There was a little bit less since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure pure ascorbic acid As in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to which is it s pretty close and the other one was around than what you re probably paying for But But that s then again it could ve been because Because not all the powder dissolved some of it was still settled on the bottom So they could be really accurate Yeah they could be you know dead on For the trials did you guys use different amounts of stuff for the two trials For the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill and then for the third trial we used 100 right A hundred And then for those trials like the third one you said you used a different concentration of NaOH Yeah Why did you use a different concentration First of all there wasn t much left of the 567 and also you know who s to you know maybe that could ve been contaminated it might not have been 567 so it s also good to use some different stuff sometimes Right You can t always base it you can t have it all on one thing Yeah that s smart How did yo actually figure out the amounts What was the math Oh We did the stoichiometry Yeah but we assumed that it was a one to one ratio one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one OH from the base And so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C Do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one H plus No we just assumed that for the experiment Maybe you should look that up Yeah Yeah The other thing anybody else So the other thing is and I just wanna make sure when you said 500 milligrams that s 5 grams right We did it accurate with Yeah cause that thing the scales here give you two sig figs right Okay I mean to the hundredths hundredths of a gram right So you crush this thing and you weighed out 50 Yeah That s what you did it How much was left in the I mean of one tablet when you you know what I mean When you crush it Yeah How much We had excess I mean one of the pills I had was 1000 milligrams so we you know we had about we had a like about It is my fault for Oh you were using 1000 milligram tablets And then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven like milligrams That s how we removed So we had to we removed mass Oh well how bout this if it if they say 500 but the thing weighs six What d you say six or seven hundred Oh yeah Then aren t there other ingredients already in there Not that were listed like Yeah they weren t listed It just said it just said Vitamin C Because they might just list the active ingredient right Yeah In other words if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim my guess would be there s more of something else Okay Because here s another thing Don t you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the Vitamin C in a clump Do you see what I m saying Yeah yeah And they ll typically use some there s gonna be some certain chemicals they re gonna use that s in there So I have a feeling before you write the company be careful they re Yeah yeah They probably added other ingredients Yeah Because what I think might ve been even better is if they claim 500 then why don t you just crush the whole thing regardless of how much it weighs And then titrate that You see what I m saying Yes Cause then they re claiming there s the You see what I m saying So that would be taking further just simply Yeah that would be The experiment Wouldn t that be like the next Yeah Thing that you could try Same thing with 1000 right I mean if they claim 1000 Yeah Go crush the whole thing and see what 
 So our question was What are the reasons why Holden has a sudden acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up And I got this question because I feel like the carousel represents growing up because you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you re not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you re just sheltering them and they re just going to live a sheltered life So they can t really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing Yeah I agree with him with Damon because I think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life Because it never really stops just continuously goes around and around And the goal is to grab the golden hoop And I think that symbolizes I don t know happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it And if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants it s just like no I m not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want They re sheltering them from their own happiness kind of Because I also agree with Brandon but I also think that let s just say Phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off I don t know if Holden would go to her but I think based on his character he would But then I think that would be bad just because like Brandon was saying if you don t let them fall if you don t let them make their own mistakes then they re not gonna learn from life So like my dad he s so overprotective I think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves Not necessarily because I think that s their fear learning from their mistakes So I just think it s better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life I think people have a hard time letting go of any child whether it s their brother their sister their actual child because it means that they re leaving soon and they re actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister they don t want you to experience the same thing that they did too so they re like telling you what to do and it seems like they re telling you how to live your life but they re giving you advice I think parents the reason that they re so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss because it really is and innocence is in a way you know because you don t know And so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they re actually making them sad if they just won t relax so they can And also I think a lot of kids don t understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you ve been born They preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they re trying to shield you from everything but they re just trying to look out for what s best for you But you can t think of it like oh once this one chance goes by I ll never have it again Because it really is like a carousel You re gonna keep going on and you will have another chance Going back to the carousel I also thought that the carousel it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it So I think Holden kind of realized that even though the carousel he knows have different people on it you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can t always keep them the same like the carousel it s not a real machine or something We all have to grow up eventually Just listening to you guys what do you think about when I was home in Los Angeles my nephew at that time was about six months old And at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that like leaves You d show him an apple and he s like Ahh And then he puts a leaf in his mouth And you re just like Holy You have to dig it out kind of a thing So in one respect I mean it s just like there s this idea of let people figure out things on their own but in that respect he ll die if you let him figure out oh you can t eat that So I m just trying to think as far as a parent goes how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them And I think that s part of the conflict Holden is having he s trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against Me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like I know that I have to let you go And I think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are Like if you do what you re supposed to do and you show them that you re working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you That s true and I also think that it s not really based on yourself mostly It s based on your parents and how they ve grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it s just nature you just know when they re ready That s what I think I don t think really it s just based on all of their mistakes I just think it s pretty much based on Interesting I think when people start changing and stuff like their attitude because I ve noticed my little brother he s starting to change and he has an attitude now He s starting to get a little rebellious and stuff and I think that s when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own and it s not just being told what to do and stuff You have to have that experience to learn from Every person has their own free will Like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can t make it drink You can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can t force them to do anything you can just have an influence on them And that s something that parents have to understand You can t force your kids to do their homework but you can ground them if they don t All right guys I want you guys to keep going You guys are doing a great job I can see your notes are also looking pretty good I m gonna move on to another group okay But keep this going because I think you guys can come up with a lot more okay Thank you guys You guys are doing an awesome job with your volume we re gonna come over to this group over here All right can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up We have a couple of questions we have like Oh okay Let s just come up with tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about The first question is my question which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people And I kind of came up with that question because Holden he kind of was denied of his childhood because Allie died and so that really impacted him And since that he s kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of Phoebe Like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she s too big for it He s like No you re not He s trying to help to her keep that innocence or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied It kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing It goes against like parent versus child So a parent when they have a child they kind of want to live their life through their child And they make them do all these chores to get into because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn t want them to do it So they kind of Interesting I said that I just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps I had these two other questions because I was reading the book where I was wondering why I was trying to get more in depth with why Holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye Okay so I kind of answered it and I said it s very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can t get back up Just like when you lose your innocence you can t get it back because this experience happened If you get exposed to it you can t magically forget it It just stays with you and that s a part of you that s just lost Interesting That kind of relates back to the question about It seems like Holden is kind of holding onto his past and so he s still living in that innocent stage and when he s living an innocent stage he can t make a wrong decision which is very hard from his now because he s 16 he keeps transferring to all these schools and he can t really grow up because he still has that memory and so that s why he s confused about his identity Good point Going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people it kind of goes through influences too Like he was talking about James Castle and when he died he said that James liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about oh yeah that s a pretty great idea It s not bad but why would people be waiting for that It was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas And I think going back to that question again that sometimes parents want the best for their child so they convince their what they want their child to be If that makes sense And at the end sometimes you can t force the child to do what they don t want to do So in a way it s kind of like you guys said the parent versus the child They wanna form their own identity as a teen but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them Is that what we re kind of getting at through everything They re so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go Is that what we re saying Yeah kind of Like Holden says he s trying to protect that innocence because he s always referring to There s a part where he s walking down the sidewalk and he called Allie to help him cross to the other side And that s kind of interesting because usually you don t think an adult would say that A child would say that And it s because he s mad at his parents because they won t talk about it so he s kind of just living with this Interesting So he s just trying to find a way of coping Is that possible Yes And then there was another kind of question about where Holden comes to Kiana said Why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on And I thought of this question because when Holden was inside just his room Phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like You don t like anything You don t like anything And he was trying to make up stuff that he did like Like he did say he liked Allie and she ll say he s dead so pick something else And he was arguing with her saying that just because he s dead you don t forget him and you can still like someone who s dead And he thinks that Allie is thousand times better than nicer than people who are alive today now So that just proves how he s holding on to that and he s not planning on forgetting that and he holds that near and dear to his heart And so that s probably why he doesn t like a lot of people because he compares them to how Allie was and his innocence his maturity level how it was then and how he sees how people today because kids don t understand he s holding on so he doesn t really understand what s going on Anything else to add on to this No I like what you guys are doing I like how you re tying in the death of Allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing What about the carousel first of all I don t know it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all Cause I know he would probably ride it too Did he ride it I was thinking of repetition because how the parents feel it rotates around and round And whenever Phoebe passed by he would tell her how pretty she looked She was never changing That s kind of what he wanted he wanted her to stay in that stage and nothing to change Nice All right guys I m gonna check on another group I want you guys to keep going with this you guys are tearing it apart Good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together All right and your notes look good as well too I like it I think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more Okay hi guys You guys the volume is doing really well So you guys fill me in Okay Tell me what you guys talked about Just mostly like and symbolism in the book Start getting louder 
 All right so we re going to need someone from all the groups to kind of summarize for us Grace Guys raise your hands So I figured okay you guys should All right I need everybody on the floor and you two groups sit right here okay Everybody s on the floor criss cross applesauce in five Five four three two and one Okay I need you to stay where you are and just turn around and I ll just have the people come talk to me and they ll talk to you all right We re going to start with let s see We re going to start with group one all right People from group one raise your hand Okay Will you girls come up and tell me what you guys talked about And I m going to listen Our question was select three characteristics that you think is most important for school and tell why So we had our score card and it said stuff So then the first one we did was my manners because if you re nice that means that you re polite and then you get more friends All right Next Following directions because you won t have good behavior and you won t do good on a test if you don t follow directions and you don t do like your study guide or study then you won t do good on a test And our last one is behavior in class is because behavior is sort of like not listening because then you probably won t listen if you re just doing like All right Thank you Now tell us everybody we re doing this and everybody can answer So how do you think that relates to a job Behavior Yes If you have good behavior then you ll get somebody to hire you because you can work good If you have good behavior most likely you ll get hired because you Anybody else Nobody else Yes ma am Um it s sort of like what they said but if you have good behavior when you re working your job you won t get fired Okay You won t get fired And you know good behavior is one of those things such as coming to work on time okay If there s nobody there to work your position then your teammates have to pick up the work or the work doesn t get done Okay group two let s see Lauren go ahead come up and read your question and answer please What is a non traditional career for a male and a female And um Go ahead We wrote for a male a fashion and a nail designer That s right And then for a female a pilot and a car designer Good good Can someone thank you Can someone give me some more ideas about some things let s see I m going to call I m looking at colors I m going to pick somebody with this color on And you can take your jacket off and I m still going to call your color if it s your color red Give me a job that you think might be a non traditional career One for a woman What did you I mean you can use the video as an example You want to think about it Construction worker A construction worker as a woman My color s red Yes sir For a woman or a male It could be for a male or female Or you can it doesn t even matter Skyler For a girl maybe a football coach For a female definitely a football coach If you guys watch Glee you see the football coach is a male a female And so yeah But now Sakwan we re going to go with you last and then I m going to go to group three Um for a male probably a teacher A male as a teacher Exactly So let s have Grace not Grace Alex Alex Mallory Mallory do you have a V under your name Yes You re from group three So let s let me read yours and you guys answer You can stay there Let me read it and you guys answer So group three was using what you have learned about non traditional careers what would you say to someone when they say that a boy can t do a job or a girl can t And I will just let you guys read I would say that it doesn t matter if you re a male or a female as long as you like your job and you can do your job well Nobody can tell you that you can t do something just because you re a boy or a girl Good Does anybody disagree with that one No Does anybody agree with that statement Okay All right Sakwan come up do you guys are going to do number four and we re going to move to the next activity Our question is what plans do we have for being successful in schoolwork We wrote do your homework follow directions paying attention being respectful good grades and not shouting loud And the oh yeah And don t have some like yelling or like stealing things like Report cards Yeah but no Yes Well we did a couple like Writing is a little challenging Reading easy some books Okay So they went with the idea of you know not too easy not too hard Good Thank you Now what we re going to do now is we re going to do some research on non traditional careers Now some of you will be where the purple papers are Some of you will be where the white ones are And it s just so that you guys will be able to talk about this later and say okay this is what I experienced on a policy job and this is what I experienced on the other one So everybody point your attention to the front and I m going to go through one of the worksheets with you I m going to go through the harder worksheet with you okay Just point your attention to the front And I m going to go through this one with you because this one is the hardest one and then all the other ones are the easier ones Okay the worksheet that we re going to do today is going to tie in what you guys talked about with careers subjects When do you all get report cards We got it yesterday You got them yesterday What I want you to do is I want you to think about your report card your favorite subject whether it be English math science social studies whether it be PE art whatever it is and I want you to pick from this site You see this site It says www bls gov k12 okay I want you to pick from that site your what subject you did the best in or what your best interest is There are some of you I know somebody here likes nature They will pick nature and in that job if it s a boy he s going to pick a job that he thinks mostly females have Who thinks they can give me an idea of what job mostly females have Molly Maybe a veterinarian A veterinarian Most veterinarians I ve seen have been female So I would go there And if I was a boy I would read through this sheet On this sheet it has some questions It says how to get ready You ll find that tab and you ll give me a summary of how they get ready for this job It says what is this job like You read that and you ll give me a one or two sentence summary of what the job is like And it says are there other jobs like this That s to the bottom And you can write those jobs down Another one says what about the future And you ll write a one or two minute summary of that section Also we have some reflection questions at the bottom of this worksheet and the reflection question is one is what did I learn about careers The other one is what s a non traditional career and the last one is what did I learn about myself So make sure you answer all those questions in the worksheet Now if I was a girl and I went to nature what job do you think I would pick Alea What job do you think most boys have that s over here for nature Zookeeper Maybe a zookeeper So the object of this is to do research in the area that you find most interesting Is this what I have to be when I grow up Mr Nealy No You just have to do research in that area So the big important part is to have research done in that area just so that you can explore different jobs And I think was it group three that had that question Yeah Group four that had the question about what would you tell somebody Who had that question Us Group three had that question and I think you guys gave a pretty convincing argument Okay I m going to tell you who s going to sit at the purple stations If you re sitting at a purple station you re going to click yes you want sound And your worksheet is already there And I want us to compare and contrast the different information you get from the two worksheets Okay purple station Skyler go to a purple station Mr Y 
 Clipart Okay You show me well if we wanted to insert a Clipart picture where do you think would be the best place to go Click on insert And then where is Clipart Here you go And I bet you we re going to find some really cool spider pictures Click on spi type in spiders and see what you come up with Hold on I ll be right over Yes Wow look at all those spiders You have tons Oh your project s gonna be neat cause you have all kinds of neat pictures Um I think something in our computer is off Okay Let s turn this off These computers sometimes get a little fussy and it s making bad choices When I get em I just keep pressing enter Well it s sort of like hitting an elevator button But you can t really make it go any faster but you feel a little better about click click click click click So go ahead and look over here Hopefully that will come up a little faster Sometimes it just is a little slow Start with there you go You know what to do Okay there s a big picture That s a huge picture That s a neat spider I think that ll be a neat one for your for your project Yeah Okay Um well when we when we clicked on the uh and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before Yeah We did want to do that We did And we clicked no Okay So that s probably why Okay So let s go onto Clipart office online and you re going to be able to find some really neat pictures here too This is the same thing Type in squirrel Let s see what we find Make sure you spell it correctly Q U I R R E It s a hard word I R R E And then the color Can I put S Doesn t matter Hit scroll or anything Okay And see what you can find Look at all those squirrels You should pick that one a moving one Yeah Okay So you copy it to your clipboard Now here s the problem You need to accept the service agreement and you ll have to do it again Yes Okay Now click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard Three times I I know Did you copy it to the clipboard Did you click on it Okay Then go back to PowerPoint Let s see if it works Uh You know how to copy and paste things so go ahead and paste it in there Yay He ll move but not right now When you go to make him a little bigger though I would say Make him fat Now you can check to see how he s doing If you wanna go to your slideshow and from the beginning and see if he ll move for you There he goes Yay See Now you know he worked Yay Good job We are entertaining using second person stories Last time we were together we started a story here today called Aliens in the Library You saw that I put my name up here on the line and it says Aliens in the Library The introduction page is the part where I underlined those you s Did you notice how these you s are underlined over and over again The reason is because we don t typically write like this This is kind of unfamiliar for us We had fun making the beginning of this story We only wrote half of the story using this graphic organizer Do we remember why we only wrote half of the story Why did we only write this side of the story Because that was like the one story Right There are two main things that you can choose from If you look up here at the board everybody should be looking up here you can see that there are two choices for each one You have your introduction and you have your two choices We only did this half of the story so right now we re going to hide the other half because we re not even thinking about it yet So the story was that you re in the library you hear a noise like what did we say rats in a blender And so you go out to investigate what the story was Now that s the coolest part about this project guys The reason we are making our own stories rather than me grabbing the book from a shelf and copying it on here is because we want to use information in our own way What s that called when you take someone else s information and put it on a piece of paper What s that called Who can remember what that s called What s that called Copyright infringement Copyright infringement or there s another big p word too that we talked about That s a tough one do you remember what that one is Plagiarism Plagiarism And if you take a story of someone else s and stick it on there it s a problem And so when you have a story in your mind you want to make sure that it is your story and your story alone The best way for me to describe this is right now for reading team we designed our own t shirts for a t shirt contest Maybe your t shirt isn t the winning entry and the team doesn t make your shirt on their shirt But you go to the competition and another team from another school district has your shirt design on the front of it How would you feel about that How would you feel if someone took your idea and walked around with your shirt on Your idea that you came up with your in your own brain How would that make you feel Kind of angry It would make me feel angry How about you Sad Sad is another really good word for it I would be furious if we used our exciting words for our writing But I would also be really disappointed Maybe kind of flattered that someone liked my idea so much they put it on their own shirt but it s the same thing Is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle Yes You think it s wrong Why is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle Because that was just like stealing You steal without even asking Right And that would hurt someone s feelings and it s illegal Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Why is wrong to steal someone s pencil Because it s their property Because it s their property and it s not yours So stealing someone s ideas is the same idea So when you go to write your stories boys and girls and the reason we re writing our own stories is because we re making this our own We re making this our own design And I think that s really important for us to remember because the more that you use your own ideas the better it is for you You have all these ideas in your heads and I know you all have wonderful creativity so we re writing our own stories We re not taking the story of a TV show you saw last night like SpongeBob and you re not making a SpongeBob story I want this to be your own idea So we have Aliens in the Library and we have our half here You re a librarian you hear a strange noise it sounds like screeching rats in a blender what should you do We decided our two choices were open the door or hide under your desk If you open the door you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway I think we had a majority of people here I don t know if everyone here likes the cutest little alien idea but this is our story and we re sticking with it It has a big pink bow in her hair antennae and a pink polka dot dress What do you do You could either invite her in or slam the door in fright You invite her in She surprisingly speaks your language She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded when her spacecraft crashed She asks if she can come home with you What do you do You have two choices here You can either take her home or find another place for her to stay Lott is a great house guest she even helps with the dishes You re glad you decided to take a chance on making a new intergalactic friend You guys have seen this before We made this story and I m not going to go over this story again and again but I wanted to review with you what we talked about because over here I m going to show you what the final product is going to look like This is what the story is going to be made We did PowerPoint together You re familiar with PowerPoint We ve done dozens of PowerPoints by now at least And so on our screen here I m going to open up my document that I made while you were gone and it is what the PowerPoint is going to look like when you re finished It is a choose your own adventure PowerPoint And this is showing that you ve mastered the skill of being able to use PowerPoint You need to show me that you understand how to use this This is kind of like our I would say our final exam for PowerPoint so we know we can move onto the next thing or the next project the next exciting idea that we re going to do So while this is loading you re going to see that there are hyperlinks and we re going to work on those as well which will take you to different parts of your document So up here we have Aliens in the Library by Mrs Albright I chose pictures that are graphics from PowerPoint or from Clipart The reason I did that is because we own those I did not take them from the internet and drag them here What happens if you take them from the internet and drag them here They re someone else s ideas remember They re someone else s pictures Yes You have to put the date and you have the put the website We have to what do we call it Cite those But we re not even going to do the citation because this is more about the writing of the project So we re going to do that instead My Aliens in the Library I m going to show you the start of this and then you re going to go start writing your own story So here s my Aliens in the Library story Now the best one from this class the one that we find or two that we like the best we re going to put on my website so the younger students can access these from home which I think is a really great idea These are not going to be graphic or bloody You can have some things happen but you can t have guts falling out and eyeballs popping out of heads Okay Because this is for a young you have to remember your audience This is for first and second graders to use in the library when they come So we are not going to make a big bloody messy gory story Okay We re going to make cute little alien stories apparently This is what we made last time together All right You are a librarian You stay late one night working on your computer and you hear strange noises coming from the hallway It sounds like rats in a blender What should you do We chose to do open the door So when I click on the button that says open the door it should take me to that page Ta da You open a door and you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway She has a big pink bow in her hair and antennae and a purple polka dot dress What do you do next We re going to invite her in If we invite her in she actually speaks your language She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded on Earth when her spaceship crashed She asks if she can come home with you What do you do I want to see what you guys pick for this one Who wants to pick one Who wants to pick a direction What are we going to do take her home or find her another place to stay Find her another place Find her another place Let s see what we decided for that part of the story You hear her shuffle down the hallway You may have missed the chance of a lifetime to meet an alien but at least you are safe The end Now notice my ends always go back to the beginning So this is PowerPoint that you re familiar with used in a different way Are there any questions about what we did here Yes How do you get the green buttons That s what we re going to talk about and that s a new part of the skill that we re working on but right now we re going to just be making these I m handing out these You re going to be in your groups and we re going to start writing our stories After you re checked and over there you ll make your PowerPoints and I ll help you with your hyperlinks individually in your tables Does it I m sorry she s talking Does it have to be Aliens in the Library No no No no no That s a great question It can be anything you want Any kind of story that you re interested in As long as it is not Bloody or gory Bloody or gory or Violent Violent or what s the other thing that we just talked about Inappropriate Inappropriate or guts you guys are really stuck on the guts Copyright Copyrighted by somebody else I wanted to show you a couple other ones that you can choose when you come for book exchange One of them looks like this This is actually a non fiction choose your own adventure about George Washington crossing the Delaware and it s about you changing history which I think is a really neat idea If you re not much of a reader but you still wanted to read some books this one is very similar to actually what we re making here in PowerPoint It has graphics it s called a graphic novel and there are different pieces that look almost like comic books I have several of these also I have the newer versions of the old ones that I showed you and read out loud The ones from 1986 remember I told you how I liked them when I was a kid a few years ago This one just has new covers on it so if you re looking for those And then this last one this is a brand new series that I m hoping to get more on it s called The Golden Path and it s the same idea just different characters and a different set of authors that made those So if you re looking for a choose your own adventure story and you go to type it in the library catalog you can type in choose your own adventure The problem with that is you need to know how to spell adventure A D V E N T U R E That s exactly right Thanks I wasn t even expecting that The other thing to remember when we re keeping in mind I m going to be coming around to help you with your PowerPoints Remember we have to use that rubric that rubric Show me that you know what I m talking about Which rubric am I talking about Show me Show me your papers Yes This is the one that you need to do Also you can put that down This other one that I want you to remember the other thing to keep in mind is we color coded these and we numbered them The slides need to go in the order that you need it to be This is a review of PowerPoint so this shouldn t be anything new that you haven t seen before This is kind of our graduation project for PowerPoint so that we can move on to the next project next time So we re working with PowerPoint Who remembers how to insert a text box What were the directions We went over this before and we went over it a couple different times How do we insert a text box You go to insert you go over under the text box click on it and then you ll drag it and there it is There it is And how do you make it change color Does anyone remember how we make it change color How do we make it change color We re on insert and text box And make sure you make one down here Yep And then you can type in it and then you do what with it That s not wanting to cooperate is it That s okay Let s work on this one together If you click on text box you make the text box and you start typing in it Who remembers how we change the color of the text box That s what we re going to need to be able to do for our buttons and our hyperlinks that we talked about Who remembers You double click on the box and it will show up Right You double click on the box or sometimes even triple click until you get those three a s at the top then you can change your color I ll be around to help you Are there any questions about this right now Anyone have anything that they want to talk about before we get started Every slide has to have a picture What happens if you do not have a picture that you like from Clipart What do you do I want you I m encouraging you to use Clipart because it s something that s already there and we don t have to worry about where the source came from But what do we do if you want to find a different picture somewhere else What do we do Find your picture You can find your picture under Google images Then what do we do Then you copy it and then you put it back and then we copy the source You have to have the source Very good Very very good Okay If you would like to have a whole separate slide with sources you can do that And we ve done that before And the date And the date is very important I m glad that you remembered that Okay so I ll be around to help you go ahead and get started back again on your project Make sure the slides are in order Do you want to format your designs You go under design you two can agree on a color scheme Do you like that one That s good Let s look back at your thing Let me see which one was number two That was number three Click on number two And it should be exactly boys look at how you did that You put the words at the top now I did check the word vial on yours and it s spelled wrong V I A L Maybe my writing is hard to read And then you have the two text boxes here at the bottom If something gets stuck can I have you guys be the experts and go over and help them Sure Okay great Thanks Yes Can you help us Sure What s the problem We can get Well this one we want to get rid of Remember when you go to do the insert and you insert a new slide you want to make sure that the layout is the title only Remember how we talked about that one So you want to insert the text box You show me what do we do Right And then what do we do Okay so you drag it What are you typing in there Okay So you need how many text boxes then Exactly All right so you go ahead and type in there so you can show me you know what to do with that Can you click on it and then use typing Upstairs Okay now you want to how do we make sure you pull that up There you go Are you okay with all the pink I don t care Good Make sure everyone s input is added though Maybe he can help with the graphics Everyone needs to be able to do something We have to make sure this is fair for everybody You re working the mouse you re working the keyboard and he s holding the paper Let s maybe switch it up a little bit closer okay So everyone has a turn 
 Also causing habitat loss Anyways Indirectly through our use of C02 emissions It says that It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and we want to keep that right We want to keep it naturally occuring we just wanna work on our Levels Yeah Because our impact is not exactly natural It s not like we re trying to stop the unhuman related processes Just like what we re doing to increase it Because like it s been staying at a level until we started releasing a bunch of CO2 and then it went up so it s kind of obvious that we re the cause of that So I don t think it s going to go down then what it was before normally Yeah I think it s highly unlikely that this would ever happen Yeah and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius is a lot too I highly doubt this would happen If we reduce the CO2 emissions in what we re doing this is kind of ridiculous Give some more evidence for that Why Yeah why Explain why do you feel that way Because carbon dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle yeah But we re contributing to make more of it There s so many economies and stuff that are dependent on it right now that are not going to get rid of it for a long time Therefore there wouldn t be such a drastic change in the amounts of carbon dioxide that there wouldn t be a drop of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius Because we don t plan to tamper with the natural Flow of the carbon cycle We just want to tamper with our which will take a long time anyway So we re going to be up and up and up for a while But we kind of already did tamper with the CO2 the natural ones because yeah we re trying to reduce our own personal emissions now that we re doing it now but we ve already gone in and tampered with it We ve already cut down millions and millions of trees We ve already so can we talk about I m trying to touch into what we ve done in the past and how if we kind of try and back out now then we leave the Earth in a sticky situation Does that make sense Well I do have a question I don t remember does the greenhouse effect exist naturally even as like a little bit right Yeah we just made it bigger So it s like they re claiming that without the greenhouse effect the Earth s average temperature would drop drastically well obviously because the greenhouse effect exists naturally but we re making so much of the greenhouse effect that we re trying to bring it down to normal levels We re not trying to bring it down below normal levels I think they re saying that this is going to happen if it s below the normal level but the problem is that we are already above the normal level so if we bring it down it s not going to make it a complete effect anyway I mean they are right saying that it s going to get significantly below as everyone said it s not going to be to the point where life will not exist But I mean the process by which sun penetrates the earth like some of the heat is retained because of that effect And what we re doing is enabling the Earth to retain more heat than it normally does So by releasing some of it by reducing emissions we are making the Earth much much cooler But we also can t get rid of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere So those would stay there and our temperature probably wouldn t drop as much probably still would drop maybe not as extreme And also we live in a world where we use so much carbon dioxide there s no way that we re going to get it to the level of just the natural processes I mean at least not in a ten year period I was wondering how long it thought we were going to slow so called global warming It doesn t really give us a projection I don t think we re going to have another ice age for a long time I mean we re having a mass extinction as it is the way we are right now I think if anything reducing it would help stop the mass extinction I think we ve kind of talked about all we can at this point Alright so at this point if you feel like you have talked a lot in an effort to get you to stop I m going to have you actually I want you to scoot your chair back like a foot or two for the next one to give some other people a chance to talk Yeah I have two you want the good ones with lotion The next one sorry is Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Somebody want to read Okay Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas Today Mythbusters Daily exclusively reveals what climate scientists have been hiding from the public Water vapor is actually a much more prevalent and potent greenhouse than carbon dioxide Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere between 30 000 to 40 000 ppm while maximum estimates put CO2 around 370 ppm Due to its abundance water vapor s a much more important greenhouse gas so human inputs of CO2 are negligible We should stop focusing on CO2 and refocus research and funding on reducing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere Would that be parts per million for ppm Yeah parts per million Water vapor unit really really Okay We have a whole water cycle I know we have the whole carbon cycle and everything but we have contributed so much to the carbon cycle I mean and global warming hasn t really been a problem until recently gee I wonder why Maybe because I don t know we are emitting a lot of carbon I mean it s not like we ve been emitting more water you can t create more water Okay Yeah I m done I m sorry I think if you explained what the greenhouse effect actually is it will disprove the water vapor theory Because the way the greenhouse effect works is completely unrelated with water vapor How Well because like isn t the greenhouse gas a gas that lets in sunlight but it prevents the heat from leaving or whatever or something right But water doesn t I don t think water does that I thought it was a greenhouse gas We learned about that in chapter 20 But We did it on the worksheet maybe or the thing that we had for homework last night It s considered a greenhouse gas That s all I know You know what effect it had Sorry No it is a greenhouse gas I remember reading that But You can grab a textbook if you d like Keep talking Elizabeth Water vapor has always been there It has always been at this level Am I wrong Well I mean if our CO2 emissions are increasing and global warming is happening then you would be releasing more water vapor I mean heat would cause that to happen But then technically this is an effect it s not a cause then Is it possible to be both Maybe Like a positive feedback loop What do you know about water vapor It s a greenhouse gas We know that now Isn t it when water evaporates Clouds Nope that is an excellent point Hold on you guys what do clouds do They block sunlight So if the global temperatures rise there would be more water vapor because there would be more fluctuations of creating water vapor Don t look at me look at your people And people who are on the outside are not supposed to be talking Well just like Well she can finish Sorry sorry no go ahead Go ahead finish She said you could finish Oh Okay Well when water vapor think about it when you like boil water it s hot and it creates water vapor So increases in global temperature there would be a possible connection between increased temperature and increased water vapor Hot air rises Which way would it be though Because if increasing temperature causes increase in water vapor does that mean increase in water vapor causes increase in temperature Well you said that water vapor is clouds so wouldn t clouds would block sunlight so wouldn t that decrease temperature But that s kind of like contradictory Can that happen though Like how hot air rises and cold air drops so maybe forgot what that process is called Well it s like sometimes when you re on like islands or something that it s like all cloudy but still really hot and humid so maybe it can increase the temperature I have a question At what altitude do clouds form It depends I mean they can form at ground level That s what s basically fog What s the highest altitude that clouds are going to reach For the most part like on average I have no idea that is an excellent question But like what part of their is it under the stratosphere There s a laptop over there if you guys want to get it No one s ever asked me that That s a really good question I don t know I know that they re throughout the troposphere but I m not sure how high up in the stratosphere they go That s a really good I don t know Can I read something really quick Four natural greenhouse gases in the troposphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide These gases have been present in varying concentrations in the troposphere during most of the Earth s long history Fluctuations in the troposphere concentration of these gases especially carbon dioxide and methane plus changes in solar output are the major factors causing new changes in the average temperature of the troposphere over the past 400 000 years And then it just talks about how from the beginning of the industrial revolution human actions have led to significant increases in carbon dioxide and therefore it correlates the relation to the increase in temperature of the globe I just read another thing Additional clouds can have a warming effect positively back by absorbing and releasing heat into the troposphere Or a cooling effect a negative effect by reflecting more sunlight back into space So they can have a warming effect So should we be worried about water vapor more than carbon dioxide No Why Because doesn t the CO2 cause the warming which never mind No no keep going That was good keep going That was it Okay Well based on what she just read and based on everything we know about carbon dioxide we know that carbon dioxide can lead to a lot of effects A lot of them bad And one of the major things is that it does lead to more water vapor and if water vapor is such an issue in terms of global temperature increase then you would think their first thought would be decrease carbon dioxide emissions But no Can we directly regulate water vapor No Can we directly regulate CO2 Yeah we can decrease our emissions We can switch to alternative vehicles We can find other sources of energy I mean there are a lot of options with water vapor we just have a water cycle We can t tell the water vapor to stop rising into the clouds like Yeah can you just pause for a moment No we can t do that because it s a natural cycle Are we done with that one So what do we have so far Nida Well that heat would cause the release of more water vapor and clouds can trap and release heat but they can also cool And concluded that clouds are water vapor first of all What we were saying should we worry about water vapor more so than CO2 Probably not because we can regulate CO2 but not water vapor And water s a greenhouse gas I call that using science I have a question for you In nuclear power plants how the steam comes from the cooling tower Is that water vapor emission That is considered a water vapor emission Okay so maybe we could control that aspect of it control the steam One additional thing to just sort of keep in mind and we ll talk about this later is what we call residence time Does anyone know what that is Residence time is how long a chemical stays in wherever it is And so one of the things that we re concerned about when we look at a chemical is its residence time So if we re talking about a water pollutant what s the residence time How long is it going to stay in water Is it going to break down quickly or is it going to be very persistent and is it gonna last for a really long time So when we were looking at greenhouse gases we re also looking at what s the residence time in the atmosphere How long does an average molecule stay in the atmosphere And water vapor tends to cycle in and out of the atmosphere a lot quicker than some of our other greenhouse gases Its cycles are usually on the order of days whereas others are on the order of months to years versus like do you guys know what CFCs are The ozone depleting compounds Chlorofluorocarbons we ll talk more about those as well CFCs are also a greenhouse gas but their residence time in the atmosphere is more like hundreds of years Hundreds of years to thousands of years That would be something we would be more concerned about So like the residence time of something radioactive could be like its half life Yep And then a third factor that we look at is also how potent of a greenhouse gas it is Some gases have more warming potential and some gases have less warming potential So we also want to look at what is its potential for heat trapping versus its concentration And we ll talk a little more about that too Alright we have two left I d actually like for you to pick one I m thinking maybe you should do the freezing temps one because we already kind of talked about the cloudy one but if you want to do the cloudy one you can do the cloudy one You suggest the freezing temperature one That s my suggestion but I won t be upset if you overrule me Let s do freezing temperatures Does anybody want to write 
 She saw sparks in the sky and a beautiful panda bear appeared in front of her Don t be scared I m your Fairy Panda Bear I will turn you into a beautiful princess so you can go to the parade But I don t have anything to wear I will wave my bamboo wand and I will take care of it The Fairy Panda Bear waved her wand and suddenly Daisy was dressed in a lovely gown On her neck was a dragon necklace that glowed Don t forget when the fireworks are over the magic is done Daisy walked up to the celebration and everyone looked at her No one knew who this beautiful princess was The Prince of China saw her from across the parade He went right to her and said Hello beautiful princess I like your outfit Do you want to hold my dragon puppet with me Sure Daisy was having the best time of her life at the parade Suddenly she saw the fireworks show in the night sky and she knew she must leave before the magic wore off Sorry I had a wonderful time but I have to go Daisy turned and ran but she caught her dragon necklace on a stair post and it fell off It stopped glowing as it hit the ground and the prince picked it up But I don t even know your name I feel nervous because something bad might happen The Prince looked all over town for the girl who would make the dragon necklace glow He went to Daisy s animal farm Out in the distance the Prince saw a little shadow by the animal pen Could that be the girl from the parade Can I try the necklace on Daisy tried the necklace on and the prince smiled when the dragon lit up like the sun Tomorrow we should be married right in the morning Alright then we shall And they lived happily ever after Let s give our puppeteers a round of applause Bravo Bravo That was awesome you guys Class Yes You re going to earn yourself another smiley Class class class Yes yes yes Boys and girls if you are on the list of children that are going to go out to work on an art project could you quietly stand up and walk to the door If you are staying in with me for our work will you sit hip to hip with the person that I ll get it No Ms Turner wants to do it Please sit hip to hip with your partner Good job Zoe that was awesome That was so cool Okay just a second then Alright turn your bodies this way Okay Criss cross applesauce Okay Who s your partner Zoe Can you sit hip to hip with her DeShaun face this way Alright if your legs are criss crossed then look up here Wow Theodore why don t you pop up and go close the door for me Alright this morning when we were talking about the books about China Xander wrote down a lot of the things we were talking about that were different between us and the people that live in China So as a class we figured out that they have a different flag they eat with chopsticks which is really neat We do too Sometimes we do right They have a different alphabet they have water buffalos there they have the Great Wall of China and they speak a different language And they also have dragon puppets which you just saw on the Puppet show What we re gonna to do now is we re gonna talk about things that are the same between our culture and the Chinese culture and we re gonna use our listening stones So Toban I m gonna be coming around and I m gonna give a listening stone to one of the people in the group and if you re holding the listening stone you re gonna say one thing that s the same and then you re gonna pass it to your partner and they re going to say one thing that s the same And then they re gonna pass it back and we re gonna go back and forth and see if we can start to talk about what s the same We know a lot of things that are different I m curious of what s the same Could you please sit knee to knee with your partner Can we show them knee to knee Zoe Like this Facing your partner like we do There you go I ll give you a Band Aid in a minute Finn okay Can you sit knee to knee with Graham Like this I have another thing that is dis Another thing that s different Uh huh What They have more dramatic designs on their clothes They have more dramatic designs on their clothes We saw that in our research material As soon as you get the listening stone I want you to say something that s the same and RJ you might want to start saying like we both might be a way to help okay RJ you have the listening stone Okay So look at Zoe listen with your eyes and your body and say we both and see how many things you can think of Can I be the stone keeper You may yes We are the same as them because we all We all have eyes We all have eyes yep We all have clothing We all have hands We both can see We are the same as them How are we the same as them We wear clothes We all have to wear clothes right We all have beds We all have beds Can we do something different You may say something different yeah We both have to sit down We both have a mouth We all have hair yep No some people can be bald That s true some people can be bald What else between us and the Chinese culture is the same We all have shoes We can all walk and we can all do things We all have bodies Did you guys see anything from the puppet show that made you think of something that s the same between us What We all can make things We can all create things and be really creative Did you see something from the puppet show that made you think we were the same We all have clothes Did you see the clothes on the puppet show We all have dragon puppets There are a lot of dragon puppets at Chinese New Year Oh we all have puppets We all use puppets That s what I was just going to say Okay we all use puppets We all have an alphabet We all have an alphabet even though it looks different Alright I m going to see if we can earn another point Class Yes That was so good Boys and girls hey can everyone turn their bodies this way Alright let s share out now we had the chance to pass the stone back and forth I just wanted to quickly hear one thing per group of something that you thought of that was the same Zoe and RJ can you tell me one thing that you talked about in your group We both have imaginations We both have imaginations And RJ said we both have brains We re all pretty smart aren t we Finn and Graham can you tell me something that was the same We both see We both see We both have rotten teeth What do you mean by that We sometimes all have rotten teeth We have to go to the dentist sometimes Yeah okay Xander and Nazarette what did you guys find in your group What You tell me what s the same We both We both can make things like necklaces and fireworks and actually Chinese people were the first people to invent gunpowder and that s what makes fireworks Did you hear that boys and girls Finn did you hear what Xander said He said that the Chinese were the first to invent fireworks Because they were the first to invent gunpowder and gunpowder is what powers the fireworks a lot That s cool Wait wait wait it s Anna and Toban s turn Anna and Toban tell me something that s the same We both have families We both have families Did you think of one Toban We all have dragons We all have dragons What does that say I ll tell you in just a minute okay And DeShaun and Gabrielle you re the last ones What s something from your group We talked about We both We both What s something that s the same We all have rainbows We all have rainbows Yeah they see rainbows in China and we see rainbows here And DeShaun what about you What s something that s the same between us and the people in China We re gonna have the same melanin as somebody We have the same melanin Yeah What do you mean by we have the same melanin as somebody Here sit up so I can hear you I think he means we have the same melanin in our skin We have the same melanin in our skin Cuz we both have light skin Yeah but what if the people in Africa have I m not talking about them The people in Africa have dark skin they have more melanin Yeah but the people in Asheville Oh in Asheville In our city we have lots of different colors of skin and different kinds of melanin but in China did it look like their skin was pretty similar Yeah yeah Alright so this is what we re gonna do Does everyone see these circles over here Yeah You re gonna come up and you re gonna pick one off our chart and you re gonna go draw a picture of something that s the same between us and the people in China and then you re gonna come and you re gonna stick it back up And this is actually a word bubble chart Okay So when I see you re sitting nicely I m gonna call you up and you come pick your color and I have brand new markers at the table Alright Zoe and Finn come pick your color Xander and Nancy come pick your circle You re gonna draw a picture of something that s the same between us and the Chinese culture You can write words too Okay the rest of you It says We will go on hug patrol today We re gonna see if we can earn it You re gonna do orange I wanna do pink Can I do green You have to do orange or Alright So what s the same boys and girls Thank you I love brand new markers We have to do something on the same Something that s the same Anna what are you gonna do We all have families We all have families Can I sit by Anna I m doing green Can you sit by Anna yes Anna Toban s gonna sit next to you Sometimes you can say we both Or we all Xander that was cool How do you spell melanin You just sound it out We all have brains we re all pretty smart Can you write that in words on there You guys are such good writers RJ what are you writing what are you writing RJ Can you read it to me What do you mean by it we all have rooms We all have our rooms We all have art rooms Bedrooms Oh bedrooms we all have bedrooms We re gonna make a word bubble Can you read it to me We all We all have a heart We all have a heart 
 Okay so put these where they need to go on the board And Liz your job is graphing So Harper tell me about your data You your plant is 20 centimeters Okay and it s grown 11 centimeters Wow that s a lot of growth isn t it Good job And Emma what s your job You were the recorder And so some of the observations The leaves are bigger It has grown bigger In the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves Cool in the middle of the leaves there s tiny leaves That is interesting And your cotyledon has come off Okay so that s good Excellent Okay so Coby you re going to be using the board and putting your data up there So tell me how high how tall is your plant now 20 centimeters Okay let s go check your graph We re out of room I have more So next time you ll have a graph that will be take two of this and it will be 40 centimeters Because 20 plus 20 is 40 So here s your 20 centimeter line what needs to go down here Okay now remember to help Parker with observations Natalie does the board Oh Natalie go up there Okay girls let s talk about what your findings are because just a second Talk to me about what happened with your plant Let s take a look So what do you think has is the reason for it not changing It was 10 centimeters when you started It was 10 centimeters again on Monday Okay but that s okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination It s done with that now and it can grow without it Is it a growing plant Looking at your graph Is it growing So maybe the leaves will get bigger and then The roots will get bigger too the roots will get bigger The water and the nutrients Okay let s take a look at your observations Roots longer white root cotyledon fell off leaves are pointy bigger leaves Now what did we observe about the growth About the growth of the plant What did we observe about it I think we should include that in your observations Okay so observer should record that Okay boys and girls I need all board job people to come on up here Okay now you guys one at a time are going to fill in your data Make sure that you re choosing a new color And I m going to make sure that these have seen all of your I don t think I ve heard about your growth here Okay tell me about what happened Joshua you need to go sit down work on the math You re not ready for that yet Okay so talk to your group and see what you need to do next Okay so tell me about what has How about the growth Right now it is okay so Alex Yes go get some Now your plant has it s 12 centimeters now it started at So how much total growth has Okay so it started at the 10 and now it s a 12 So can we make that who s the recorder So we want to make that because this is how much is it growing Okay so it s growing and let s look at our graph You ve got your day and now Oh so you went up a little bit too high here Let s take a pencil Alex and just do a small X right there so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12 Maybe more so that we can see it Keep erasing it that s good Don t play with your plant please If you re all finished you should be working on the math problems Okay now let s talk about your plant Okay let me come around here Tell me about your plant It started to get bigger The shell was growing out and we it s And how much has it grown total 50 Oh five Five that s right You started at seven and now you re at 12 so the difference between That s exactly the same as my plant too What I noticed about yours is over the week it came out of like you said the seed cover came off and the leaves Started to peel and it started to break Yeah Okay so the stem is really long Let s put this up here The leaves are bigger Who is the observer You are okay And can we see something about the seed cover Okay so while he s doing that we need to do some important things here What about the date One 30 goes here because that was Monday One slash 30 Okay and today s date is Okay and that s it because today s the third and this bar shows Natalie go sit down This bar shows that Good job you guys and you ve got that added And let s make sure that we re gentle with that measuring You can work on it together Molly stay with your group You guys work on that together You guys can work on it together So you guys have had what s the most common number of seeds they found Five Five good How about the total number of seeds Now do we know is each dot worth one Okay so what s the total number of seeds So how many seeds in all Okay boys and girls Sophia s finishing up If you have math extension problems in your table group please put those to the side And I m going to ask Chloe s group and Angel s group and Derek s group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we re close to our graph You do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already Chloe come join us please Alright Ashton and Josiah you can move closer so you can see or you can stay there Coby and Isaiah please come join us Alright Now one last person needs to fill in her data Let s see that would be me and my height was 16 Okay so while I m doing that take a look at the graph we just built And think about what are some things that you notice about the graph What do you see What are some things in common What are some things that are different Turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph Okay eyes on me Now you tell me what are some things that you noticed about the graph Alex That six and three has the same height as us Okay so group six and three and you are group Five Five all have the height of all the way across and it s 10 12 Centimeters That s right so we have three groups that have the same height Ashton what did you notice So group one four and your group eight they re all not matching But all the other ones have a match So group eight and one and four are separate They don t have someone who s kind of similar So that leads me to ask about groups two and seven tell me about them Blake Seven and two are the same Seven and two are the same they both are the same why Keith Because they both have 20 20 Centimeters So what group on there has the smallest plant Alfredo what group on there has the smallest plant Group four Toby and how tall is group four s plant Ten centimeters Ten centimeters that s right Now group four Molly tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant 
 How old are you Five years old Five years old Blake is this a bear Yes Yes Is this a bear Yeah Yes Is this a bear No No very nice Is this a fire truck No No Is this a penguin Yes Yes What s your name Blake Walker Blake Walker Give me eyes Awesome Where s your eyes Where s Blake s eyes Here s the eyes Eyes Good job Eyes Where s eyes Eyes Very good Eyes Where s Blake s eyes That s the eyes Eyes very good How old are you Five years old Five years old Do you want the elephant No You want the ball No You want the book No Want the fire truck Yes Vroom Vroom Oh my turn fire truck Excuse me I train please I play train please I play train I play train please Train My turn train Thank you I play train Choo choo Choo choo I play with train please Train Choo choo My turn train Thank you I play train please I play train please I play train please Train My turn I play train please Blake I play train All mine I play please I play I play train I play train please Train He s traveling with the whole thing He is at least waiting until he gets closer before he starts Uh huh He s not repeating My turn I fire truck I play with fire truck please I play fire I fire I play with fire truck please Fire truck My turn I fifth please I fifth please I play the please Fish Fish please Fish Uh oh Fish broken Bye bye fish Let me see Now see Alright See I knew they worked All done fish Bye fish Right bye fish All done fish I fish please I play I play Fish Please Fish Fish All done fish All done fish Bye fish I play I play fish please Yellow fish Orange fish All done fish Done fish Bye bye fish I play I play with fish I play with fish I play fish please Fish Can you count fish one two three four Fish all done Bye fish I play fish 
 At first we put only tap water in it and then we all of a sudden changed it So but there s still tap water in with the oily water So you think that s why the control got messed up because it had too much Well that s not variables changed my only reason What s the other reason My other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was like the seeds were duds Were your guys s the oil ones That one s not yours No Ours is the one that s all grown Oh why don t you go get your cup and show people So this is oil Okay well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden it died it looks like Kind of So like at first it was normal with that thing and then well I don t understand that chart Yeah me neither because it looks like It looks like it didn t grow then it grew really really fast then it went down Super What happened was it grew and then it over polluted and then it just died Looks like that Well like Well like what I don t get is I see the other oil one it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones It just like suddenly grew all of a sudden All the oil is the same with the control which you have all of a sudden all of a sudden also these diagrams Also in the control diagram that went back down to zero centimeters I don t know Yeah this chart might have messed up Because that means both these plants die And then the control regrew Yeah it doesn t make any sense It doesn t It turned white and then it died and turned brown because on my chart it grew point it grew it grew 0 14 and then 0 14 again and then 0 04 so like alive dead alive and stuff When it grew the second time did it grow or did it subtract The second time I think it died and then the last time it just kept on growing but the first time it started growing it grew second time it grew one centimeter What did you put in to help it grow What did you put in it to help it grow Oily water So did the oil or the manipulator control grow more The manipulative one grew more because it grew and then it died So why do you think it did that Because like I what I thought is that it was too much oil on it and then oil gets on the leaf it like it helps the plant grow or something Just killing other Doesn t the plant feed off the leaves So the oil got spread on the leaves and then it s feeding the oil then it died Look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant Do you I think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because like acid is good for you and it s mixed with water so it s not too bad for the plant But I think it got way too much acid and acid actually eats things It kills it and that s why I think the plant is all dead because like you said Nolan it did grow because acid is good for us but yet when we have too much it dies So that s why I think this plant is all shriveled over I agree with you because acid is part water and that s what rain is but there s a little bit of acid so water s good for you But acid it doesn t grow it s not good for you so Well actually it is good for you but not a lot I think you re Maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on maybe it got too much acid rain And then the acid rain overtook the water and died So it like decreased by a lot That s why I think it s just like the Red Bull because Red Bull is like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy See right there Just like Red Bull It increases and then decreases What d you think Misha Well yeah I think like what you said Nolan because the regular plant grew just fine and then that the experiment grew like good and better than the regular one but then it like the acid overtook the plant just like Nolan said What else I noticed about my control plant it started big at first and then it decreased in size Then it got bigger so it s going off and on in size So it actually did kind of better than this because at the end it did better than that one and the last opposite It like died after the second one it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks Yeah but it was only to a point it was living because when I did my second observation it was still kind of full but it was broken on the side So it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water basically It died My actual skin and everything the plant grows faster but it also dies faster and I figured from like the oils on my hand Why do you think it did that Because the oil on your hand Because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as like oils in a car but oil still has the same base But how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand I don t know Instead of wearing gloves maybe it s just the stuff inside of the oils and everything but it grew faster and also died faster Like the plant that we have now is dying faster but this one since it has water normally and everything it s healthy and stayed big the whole time But the other one is like that but it died If you have what you were saying earlier when you have oil on your hand and then it was you polluted it with oil don t you think you polluted that one too No well like it s my whole point is that it speeded up the process What speeded up the process Like the oil when I plant a bean or something when I plant bulbs for tulips or something and I touch it with my hands instead of my gloves Then it actually seems I may just be paranoid but it grows faster and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn t grow as fast I don t know the depth of that part or something I don t get what you re saying Are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster No I think it s just the oils of your skin So what would the oils in your skin do for a plant Like the oil for your plant here Is it the same like the oil that we used Like it didn t make them healthy but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger but the other one Show me your data that suports that This Yeah What s your data that supports that The These ones Yeah the one the data that supported it was that oops is is it went with the control It already had grown and it was after a week and ours still hasn t grown And it was growing at 0 16 centimeters per day and then the next time it was growing 2 7 centimeters a day So what does that tell you That it was growing a lot faster but it wasn t necessarily growing as efficiently Okay What do you mean by inefficient Efficient What do you mean by efficient I mean like it grew faster but it wasn t necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast So was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn t healthy Yeah because the leaves now they re all gross and blotchy and they re dying and they re crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these And they have a shine to them because of the oil What did the rate of growth confirm that At first it was kind of spiked for a little bit and then it started going back down and now it s dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants it grows in a steady period of time With that it grew really fast and now it s dying really fast So what conclusion did you get That oil still makes the plant grow but it s not necessarily healthy for it Do you agree Yeah because me and Because my group my experiment when we did this it was growing super fast and now it s like dying and stuff And we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because On the grass a little bit and the number of leaves will only be like two and then it shrivels up and died And then the color would stay light green and kind of brown like how it is right now and then my data was according to my graph the acid rain plant grew more than I thought It grew 25 centimeters but it started to die because of It turns light brown and started to die The leaves increased from two all the way to six leaves by the end Okay My question was what would the effect be if I changed the water to salt water and I put if I change the water to salt I predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant I predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant I predict the color will be white ish gray ish My manipulator variable is water to salt water According to my data I was correct because the height was the same and the number of leaves were the same The data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants The rate of the growth was zero On the salt water there was crust on it and it was Restate that so that Jessica gets it and see if Jessica knows And then like we were saying Olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt and then like you know how water it attracts a lot of light and so people get tan Yeah Faster and then so maybe the shine for the oil maybe it attracted more of the heat from the light and it burnt the leaves so Like the glisten from it Yeah Maybe that s why it looks all burnt and Because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it s a burnt reel Piece of paper Something like sands off in the reel of a video and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen That s what it kind of reminded me of Because it has a brown wrinkle around it And then it s dark and then it s kind of brown and crisp so that s what it kind of reminded me of and that s what made me think of it Yeah and then how I thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how Olivia said that when you re in water it attracts more heat and light to you so maybe that s how So that s how I got the idea of maybe that s what happened So do you have anything to add Jared No You Jessica No Okay Okay so I think the reason why mine didn t grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water Because when Mr Kelson sprayed it all of the salt right here you could feel it It s all stuck to the top so the water can t get down to the soil and all that So it can t grow at all 
 Alright I heard the term velocity So I think that sounds pretty good Velocity of a skateboarder the more important you re going to have I like velocity Keep talking amongst yourselves I m just kind of here to guide you along Make sure the people here I don t want anyone to have their back to each other I know the room is difficult to do that but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group I know it s difficult Wait The whole class Oh yeah I want the whole class to discuss this I thought you were doing like table and table No no no I want everyone to talk Sorry Okay You guys can talk just like I talk across the room Feel free to do so So someone when we ask their velocity You need more length to the tracks Steeper You don t have to raise your hand If you re looking in that person s eye or you re looking in my eye feel free to You need a longer track Distance Is it the friction I will tell you that we re not going to look at friction as part of the system Let s look back at that proposal for one second Just want to make sure I didn t miss anything It s always good to look at what they give us Let s see What science terms are in there Quantitative Qualitative Okay Energy Oh We got energy in there Energy transfer Oh energy transfer Okay So I think they want something to do with energy It said quantitative We should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy right Do we have them Yeah We do It s half mv squared right And then What Christina said we re going to be collecting data quantitative we ll probably have to use some formula that associates with this I agree Okay Okay He gave us the formula E sub k 1 2 mv squared Energy due to the gravitational field E sub g mg Alright Let s make sure we know what each of these letters stands for M mass and the unit Kilogram G Acceleration due to gravity Lauren said force of gravity Okay You want me to write that in Which one is it Oh its the effect from the gravitational field Okay that s fine You will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force but what are the units for this Meters per second squared So that can be kind of confusing if they re calling it gravitational force and then they re saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units Acceleration Acceleration right So I m going to put acceleration due to gravity Okay Good H is height Yeah h is height And that s in Meters Sounds good Okay So now we go over here Mass and kilograms and then velocity and that s in meters per second Good And then if you remember that force doesn t like careless errors so maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units So what are the units that we re going to have for E sub g and E sub k What is it Joules Joules Oh that s right How do you remember that I m smart Okay That s good too Oh there was a pretest that had that on there That sounds good Okay Great You re taking that prior knowledge Energy is a jewel Energy is a precious jewel Alright You want precious Okay there s jewels There s semi precious and there s precious What are they diamonds and rubies So energy is a precious jewel Kilogram times a meter per second squared Newton Newton Good Newton times a meter A joule A joule Right Over here mass and kilograms Kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared don t forget the square Kilograms times a meter again is a newton Newton times a meter that s going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then multiply that by that meter and again you get joules Okay We want to make sure that we don t did everyone see how we got that joule there Meter times another meter right Yeah Because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton Times a meter remember this is meters squared because of that Oh okay Okay So you know the boss doesn t like careless errors so let s make sure that we have the appropriate units Okay I don t mean to interrupt you guys Why don t you continue with that You ve got some formulas here now For potential energy wouldn t mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants so height is the only one that that could manipulate So if the height is the greater distance from the Earth then it would have more potential energy because they re directly proportional Yes Let me ask you guys I can t help but interrupt once in a while right But I just wanted to If I put this marker on the table does this marker have potential energy What is the reference point Oh oh oh The table No The center of our planet Yes Okay So I heard a fight I think that s a good thing The more danger the more fun I thought right Yes They re going to wear their headgear Is this guy wearing any head oh he s wearing head protection Why is that important by the way So the force doesn t apply to your head Okay I like that Ah Inversely proportional right I like that yeah So it increases the amount of time decreases the force So yeah danger is an aspect here but this guy seems like he s doing okay He s got his headgear on but that s definitely if you re designing a park you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren t going to be injured There are going to be accidents with skateboards but they ll wear their gear I m going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier Okay So how high do we want the If we want it to have a bigger potential energy transferring the bigger kinetic energy we might want to have the height from the reference point which is the ground and kind of higher I heard reference point Let me see if I can put a reference point on this I did just put a little click a button and get the reference point okay I think the thing should be on the ground Yeah The weight s like it s safer and it s possible Do you want me to just to extend the We ve got a couple of things going on here I m sorry A couple people said yes they wanted me to put that on the ground So if those people could say that again that would be great Say that again You want to put it on the ground And I think I heard a dissenting voice in the crowd Someone that said something else I did Oh okay I said that if you increase the height it s still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side technically you d be able to go back and forth They haven t brought in the supports for this herculean innovation That s right I mean I don t think it really is going to affect the design structure so Whether it s on the ground or I ll just pull that down That s fine Yeah I don t think that s going to make a difference That might make it easier for the person to step off the track too when they re done You know this guy s going to get really tired There s no friction so he won t have to step off on the nice safe track But you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn t go back up as high so if you have Alright One at a time I like this Someone said something Christina said something and I think Karuna wanted to add to that He goes just as high like there s no change because there s no friction So Yeah then he doesn t go up to the top I could put the pie chart in sure And can you start him at the top Alright So I m going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to he s going to climb up the ladder right There s like a pretend ladder here And then how s that Yeah Okay Now I noticed when I did that something happened The pie chart Oh yeah Why Sounds like a height there that s increasing reference point is greater I like that Okay I m going to let him go I don t know if I can do that actually but I will try Yeah we can play around with it Make the sides taller then he ll have a greater distance to travel and it ll actually be more I don t know if I can yeah I don t think I can do that I don t think it ll it only allows me to click on the blue dots there You have to add track to do that You want me to pull those off to the side Okay Okay So you made a little bit different half pipe Oh no Alright So you don t want to look there s some thermal energy What s going on with that Okay That might ve happened But why do I now see red in the pie chart Yeah There s a force that will allow for the energy to transfer Good Let s get him back on that half pipe and you know guys I don t think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up So I don t really think that is going to make much of a difference But we do need to collect some data and start with this proposal so Where did we leave off I think there was something that we were looking to collect there Height Okay good Let s continue with that please Well measuring tape Oooh There is a measuring tape I don t even see these things Measuring tape oh It even says fet okay good So how s that look No no Well what do you want me to do with it Going to the ground That s not the ground From the reference point Oh alright I m right on the reference point Go up a little So what do you want me to measure Well where am I going to measure From what to what The reference point to the highest point Okay I think the highest point would probably be the center of him but they do have that nice little red dot Can we just agree that we re going to go with the red dot Yes Yeah Why don t we go there It can t be diagonal Okay Is that good Yeah Yes Shut the lights off for this measure Okay Now this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with I wonder if there s any easier way for me to get this Oh Oh that s pretty neat I suppose I could use a measuring tape or I actually have that so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier if it could speed things up So what do we want to say for the height Seven I don t know if I d say seven So we all agree it s somewhere between six and eight yes Yes I d say 7 2 And it does go over the seven a little bit so height equals seven point Two Four Six Zero You tell me or it s going to go forever Let s start over again Seven I don t think it goes to the half mark 7 1 Maybe we need a show of hands on this Who believes it s 7 Who believes it s 7 meters No one s raising their hands that s good How about 7 1 7 1 meters Alright I got one person there Now I m looking at this from an angle right And anytime you want to make a measure you do want to have your eyes right above what you re measuring and obviously I m just going to move over here just so I can get a little bit better And then what else can I do to try to really measure this well Pause it Yeah I think I m going to pause the animation Now if I was making an actual measurement I d make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever I was measuring What do we say about oh that s good What do we say about these measures that we make in science They should be you re only as good as your measures Yeah You re only as good as your measures What does that mean Kristen It means that if your measures are not precise and consistent then everything else won t be precise and consistent Can someone elaborate on that a little bit Or do you want to add to that No someone else can elaborate on it Okay Are you sure I can give you a little more No Okay Let s see Who haven t I called on at all today because I want to make sure I get everyone You haven t called on Jill Alright I m sure she doesn t mind repeating it for you I think you said you re only as good as your measures Because if your measures aren t precise then all your other work that you re using the measures for Yeah if you measure something for speed It would be wrong Why Well no if you It could be you re right If you make some poor measures and then you go to graph it No If you take distance and then multiply it by time then speed would be wrong Like if you had the wrong distance then speed would be wrong and then making it after that your graph would be wrong Well it would be wrong right from the perspective you said distance times time and speed is distance divided by time Did everyone hear that Yeah That s okay though You re saying we don t want to get off the main idea here If you re getting these distances wrong and then you re going to graph your slope is going to be incorrect yes So remember in science we collect data From that data we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns graph it look at trends and patterns So if everything starts from our measures those next steps aren t going to be correct 
 These colors What color is this Yellow oh my gosh did you find a lot of leaves that match this color No You forgot to do it Well let s do it right now Alright go ahead and put it there What other ones are yellow Mmm That s a yellow one Is that yellow Okay put it right there Let s see If we put these two together do they match in color no No so you might not want to put that one in Okay wow So put it here you ve already given it a check So now what I want you to do by looking at the sheet I want you to sort by size What does size mean If something is bigger If something is bigger or smaller Now which measurement which size are you going to sort by Big or little Big Okay so all your big leaves put them in the middle Okay You decide how you want to sort them So if you want to use both baggies that s okay If you want to just use one that s okay too Okay that s okay that s okay too I noticed that you haven t started sorting yet So which one do you want to sort by Or do you want to make up your own I like to do this Yeah color Color Okay so ok what color are you going to choose I m gonna choose brown Jennifer is that ok You have to ask your partner Sort by brown So put all the leaves that match the brown in your work space Ok let s see what s going on over here Ok well let me see this Let me see that please Ok we are going to work with partners I know sometimes it can be hard to work with partners because you re trying to make a choice and maybe one person wants to do one thing and maybe one person wants to do another so we re gonna work together to figure this out Well let s get working She s laughing How do you want to sort your leaves now Let s get our workspace in the middle I notice you already sorted by color so now how do you want to sort By shape Ask your partner if that s ok Ask your partner if that s ok Ok is this the shape you want to sort by Oh this is pretty tricky See if you have any more leaves that match this shape How can you describe this shape How can you describe that shape So you re going to look for ones that have little points So you re actually sorting by points Yes am I hearing that right So look at your leaves and look for ones that have teeny tiny points Look at your leaves so look at your leaves here Ones that have teeny tiny points It has points its very tiny Does it have points No no side points Yes does it have some side points Do you think that belongs here Oh really I loved how you used your magnifying glass to find those little details Keep on looking through yours Jennifer because I have a feeling that you are going to find some more Take a look at these points and take a look at these points You re sorting by points right Are those little points or big points Little or big Little Are they little like this Are you sure So you think this belongs here Okay Don t worry about your name for right now I ve noticed that you ve sorted by every way Now are you ready for the challenge Can you make up your own way to sort Something that we didn t talk about on Friday Oh I bet you could Yeah well let s think a little bit more Now I want you to look very very closely at these leaves What s something that s the same about some of them That s the question that you should be asking yourself What s the same about some of these leaves They have dots Really they have dots Remember we had colors up here Andrew just said something Some of these had dots Do you see dots on some of your leaves Yes do you think that s a good way to sort So wow see I thought you said you couldn t figure out another way So I want you to put all of the leaves with dots on your workspace Okay how are we sorting here That s okay The way you re doing it is perfect All you need to shoot for is to keep count of what you ve done so far So let me come to you I ve noticed that you had sorted by color so far Which one is next which one would you like to do next Okay which one do you want to do It s up to you Do you want to sort by big leaves Is that okay Monica Okay so look at your leaves and sort by size Now find all of your leaves that are big Uh oh does this one belong there Does this one belong there Okay wow Amazing I like how you re really looking at your leaves Absolutely that one s very big nice job I really love how children stopped working They put their hands up Friends can I share something that I noticed Is that okay When I was walking around I noticed children using their eyes and sometimes their hands to explore their leaves Some of you figured out new ways to sort your leaves And I can t wait for those kids to share their ways Some of you went ahead and you looked at what we talked about on Friday Which was also a really great way to use a resource in our room to help us sort I just want to remind everybody that your job right now is not to touch your leaves Your job right now is not to touch your leaves Your leaves are down Because it s important for scientists to stop what they re doing and share what they have noticed Let s take a peek This is a graph does anybody recognize this graph Does it look like something we already do What is it raise your hand if you want to share It kind of looks like you use something it s something we do every almost every day Brian Um the calendar Yes And what in our calendar sweetheart looks like that The weather Oh I love how you re thinking Absolutely right our weather calendar looks like this Today friends we re going to share how you sorted And then I m going to go ahead I m going to color in boxes and then at the end we re gonna see What was the most popular way to sort What was maybe not the most popular way and if anyone had a different way to sort Okay So just give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size Look at your sheet look at your sheet And give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size today Let s see And actually I m only going to ask one partner to put their thumb up Because I m only counting partners So one group two groups three groups four groups five groups six seven eight groups nine groups ten groups eleven groups twelve groups Uh oh Do I have enough spaces No Oh my gosh I ll have to add them Eleven twelve so there were twelve groups There s thirteen that wanted that sorted by this kind Mrs you forgot mine Okay anybody sort by shape today Anybody sort by shape today Okay keep your thumbs up One two okay One two three four five six seven eight nine ten Wow ten groups sorted by shape Mrs you keep forgetting mine Mrs you keep forgetting mine Okay friends before we continue going on with that did you sort by another way today Did you sort by another way that wasn t something we talked about on Friday Emma did you sort by a different way today Oh sorry you re two Joel and Emma I ll come to you What s another way you sorted Okay did someone sort by a completely different way that s not on your chart Andrew Dots Dots did anybody sort by dots today Yeah okay What s another way you sorted your leaves Catherine Counting the points Okay now that was a way that we sorted on our sheet but that s okay How s it different So you were looking for nine points okay So friends there s so many different ways you can sort and I just want you to put your hands down Because there s so many different ways you can sort and there s many more ways than just what we practiced today As scientists and mathematicians we re gonna continue sorting and looking for similarities things that are the same things and things that are different Give yourself a pat on the back Thank you so much friends for doing your best job today 
 Yeah the oil Okay so we discussed that one So Maddie is going to write down about the peanut butter What the observation was At the first observation it was 9 centimetres And it has grown In Joshua s words it has grown Good And you re gonna do that for all three of them Okay um The peanut butter No we just did the peanut butter Oh no I mean the banana it s it s It s grown like 4 inches taller Its like 1 1 and a half inch taller Its like one and half inches Okay what is that Look Its like 9 and a half 10 and a half 9 10 and 12 That s 1 2 3 We re looking at the bananas yeah wait that s half an inch Alright so did you get that Were the Cheetos recorded Okay good Alright so now we ve got let s look here Josh go ahead and read number 9 Compare and record the results from all three fat absorb absorption observations Observations Observations okay so we re going to look at all three here we ve got our data laid out here Look at your Cheetos Um the first time Cheetos was eight and a half inches the second time it was 10 and a half inches and the last time it was 12 12 centimeters So what does that mean Joseph what do you see when you see those numbers going like that Um its like growing because every time you check one its like a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on and it gets a little bit more big So basically the longer that the Cheetos sat on the paper towel the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel right Okay So um Josh if you ll just go ahead and write that down about the Cheetos And Hailey what did you notice about the next food The apples Um two times it stayed the same and one time it got a little bit smaller Just got a little bit Yeah Okay it says two are the same and one is just a little bit different And that could have been just um where is our centimeters It could have been just human error where we just sort of measured a little bit off Okay Um cause if you look at this apple sample here there isn t really any coming out of the green circle is there So nothing was absorbed from the apple Did you see that Okay alright So if you ll add that to our list that we ve noticed we observed Shemaire you look at those potato chips I m going to leave that one here Tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips The potato chips Talk real loud for me Um ok the potato chips they like changed each time Like the first time it was 5 the second time it was eight and a half and this time it was 7 And what are those that you are talking about what units of measure Centimeters Centimeters okay So we want to make sure we get centimeters written in on there okay uh huh Alright so what does that tell you about potato chips Um that its not like that fat it doesn t got that much grease in it cause pretty much it showed like it was lower and then it got a little bigger then it just got a little bigger Okay so comparing the three here what do you notice Pretty much that this one has more fat than these two It looks like with this observation just this one here in class today and later we re gonna do we ll look at the food labels of potato chips and Cheetos But right now just on our observations it does look like the Cheetos have more fat right now okay But when we start reading its gonna be potato chips Oh that leads us in It s gonna be Cheetos So go ahead so um let s look at number 10 read that for us Josh What can you conclude from the observations and recorded data Which snack has the most or least amount of fat So you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there Put most and least Fine okay I d say the apples have the least amount of fat And the potato chips have the least the apples have the least amount of fat then the potato chips second and the Cheetos is last And why do you think that might be Why do you think the banana has expanded the most Because its I don t think its because of the fat in the bananas and getting in Talk loud I don t think its because of fat with the bananas that s getting oil on the paper towel because bananas are pretty healthy and they don t really normally have fat in them Yeah yeah Okay so that s your background knowledge You are aware of that What were you gonna say It s like its not fat or oil its like its just water Maybe water absorbed in it What prediction would you make if we were to let this sit over night to where like the water would have time to dry up What would you predict this paper towel would look like tomorrow Let me go with Tray It would be all wet and soggy So you think it would actually be more wet Yeah Okay Emily what do you think Well I would think that the way it is now that the paper towels are gonna end up like that and the bananas would get all and more disgusting and Okay does anybody think that the banana might that the wet watery part might dry up Maybe I think it would expand a little bit more and then start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too Okay well alright We ll actually leave that one out and see and we ll check on it tomorrow And see what it s doing And we ll kind of answer our own question there okay Okay wait we re not finished what do we say about the banana You have to talk louder though The banana I guess the banana like expands the wetness It expands a couple centimeters like a half a centimeter Good use of centimeters I like how you re using the actual mathematical term there The centimeter is good Okay while she is writing that I m going to let Tray go ahead and read that next question Well if you can see it Maddie will you let him read that so we can kinda be thinking while your finishing up there Um what can you conclude from the observ observation and recorded data What snack has the most most and least amount of fat Well um as my opinion I would think that the banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge Okay Josh Well I would think that the fudge has the least amount cause it has the least amount of absorbed like grease and fat But the banana has like all this oil water and all that like sinking into it Okay Maddie I think that the peanut butter has the most amount of fat because um like I said earlier the bananas are more healthy than the peanut butter and it s probably just water and this is like oils and salt and stuff making it more greasy and that s probably more fat absorbing into the paper and then the fudge hasn t had very much at all so I would say it has the least amount of fat I would agree with like most of y all because the banana and the peanut butter is like has like a lot of wetness in it And the fudge has like a little bit of wetness Like a centimeter Yeah about a centimeter But also the bananas could have the least amount of fat because they are healthier and that s probably just water Compare the results to the original group hypothesis Our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat Talk loud Our Hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat Our group decided this after discussing Cheetos versus potato chips deep fried and adding salt and Cheetos are made out of cheese so cheese is made out of milk from cows which is healthy Oh wow lots of thought went into that Okay so read that question again how do we compare our original hypothesis to what we ve discovered now in our research We were wrong Say that again We were wrong Okay so according to our data what did you find Why do you say we were wrong Because like the Cheetos they had like a bunch of fat grease and stuff Talk louder And the potato chips they like barely have any They had some but it wasn t quite what you were thinking right What were you gonna say Josh we re gonna come right back to you No Yes Joseph She thought it was the Cheetos which we thought it was that and afterwards now since we found out that it was probably the cheese Talk loud When it gets stuck on you fingers it s all wet and oily and everything Okay No she s the one that said cheese was healthy Okay well think about it some cheeses are healthy this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese added to the Cheetos right Go ahead Josh what were you gonna say She said that maybe the salt from the potato chips could ve dried up the grease maybe Okay Hailey Pretty much what Josh said It s the same Okay so you just agree with that So Josh maybe you could all just write down some of what you all discussed About the change from what our prediction or our hypothesis was to what we found now Okay And Hailey if you want to go ahead and start some of our discussion questions Okay Based on our discoveries from today what snack has less fat Joseph Um apples Claire Definitely apples Josh Apples Yeah apples When you go home today what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why Joseph I d probably do the apples because it pretty much has no fat which we learned and I d probably want to eat no more Cheetos since I found out how many fat was in them now Never again Never Oh you wouldn t live would you Very good Hailey say that again I wouldn t eat Cheetos very often You wouldn t eat Cheetos as much but in limited quantities right Okay very good Shemaire which snack would you choose I d probably have to say apples too because they are healthy either way and I love Granny Smith apples they re my favorite Oh good good healthy snack eater I m going to have to say now since we found out Cheetos how much fat it has Then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there we probably don t know how much fat is in there Right Well we re going to look at those food labels closer now that we ve investigated these and see which one really does have more fat the potato chips or the Cheetos 
 Okay So what s going on with this group You go ahead since you did it We made like a T chart Oh fantastic Graphic organizing Love it We put the ones that we re going to delete over here and then keep over here Now we re discussing why we deleted these or chose them Was it pretty easy to choose the keepers It was Yeah we agreed on most of them What about the delete Have there been some discussions We had to think about the smart and the healthy and religious Yeah Okay Good Oh and stay in school They don t have to stay in school So there were some that you had to discuss a little more Yeah Tell me some of your thoughts Which was the most difficult Probably the religious And also smart Tell me a little bit about the discussion you had with religion Well first of all we thought that it wouldn t be but then we thought some people had different religions and other people My dad has a friend my dad has a friend that isn t a Christian but he s still a really good person It s just like as you grow up being a Christian that s just what you think But then as you think about it that s not how you re a good person Okay So you stepped back from what you knew and you looked around Were you able to come up with some examples like was it your uncle No it was just a friend A friend So were you able to come up with some examples of people that were not religious people Yeah Can you tell me some qualities on the list that they have even though they are not the Christian My uncle he s not religious but he s a teacher So he s helping kids and stuff and he s really nice My neighbor she s really nice You can t even tell that she s not religious You always think she is She s kind and friendly She s respectful I don t know just really nice Okay So when we first put up our list that was one of the qualities that were on lots of list boom boom boom then just religious So we had to step back from it to really stop and think about that Or they could be not doing their best in school but they could be a really great friend or person Very good There s more than one kind of smart Yeah Do you think that having good qualities and keeping yourself with those qualities is another kind of smart Yes And you re right I know some mentally challenged friends people that are some of the most kind hearted people Good discussion Good going Okay Why did you do happy Because whenever you re sad then you just have that gloomy feeling hanging over you all the time Yeah And also if you re not happy all the time you don t have it all the time every minute you can t just be depressed all the time And then Stay in school Yeah Why did we go into stay in school Thank you Lexi Come on over here Veronica Okay ladies what is your question We re going two ways I kind of think that you need to be religious Because if you go to church it helps you become a good person But then at the same time there s like people in the world that are really great people but they re un relgious They can t be religious Like countries And they re still a good person even though they can t Also we were thinking people that do go to church aren t always taking what they learn and using it in their lives So you have found some examples of religious that are not exhibiting other qualities and then people who are not religious who show a lot of these qualities Yeah Okay So that kind of goes both ways I think we should delete I don t know I can go both ways So you can see both sides Yeah You don t have to be religious to be a good person Okay So can you set aside what your own religious beliefs are that if you believe this way if you don t believe this way something bad will happen to you Can you set that aside and just look at the person s qualities My sister has a friend that goes to college with her and she doesn t hang out with her that much but she doesn t believe in God And that s her religion But I guess that would be their religion So really everybody has a religion kind of but they can t express their religion or go to church and stuff like that Okay So which one s our leader Jordan you re our leader So do you want to take another vote and see where it stands Okay You re changing in a way Okay So where do you stand now Those are all qualities that make up a good person but again we all had to make a decision on it But again other groups can have different opinions about that or different opinions on how to make a good person So we can think that you need to be religious but then another group can say you don t have to be religious Right It s all about what this group decides I was also thinking about the Ten Commandments that it has a choice If you want to be religious that s also putting that in mind Okay So are you leaning towards deleting or keeping We re just talking How about you Grace I kind of think it s I don t know I think we should keep and then I think that we maybe should delete because you don t have to go to church to be a good person Does anybody have a personal experience in their own family of somebody who s not religious that is a really great person Well like they don t go to church or they re just not like Okay That is a great statement that Jordan made that will give us pause to think What does religious mean to each one of you So maybe that s another place to start What does that word mean And then that might help you decide whether to delete it or keep it Because going to church doesn t necessarily make you religious You can just walk into the church and listen to your pastor s sermon It doesn t mean that you re a good person So discuss that for just a moment Okay What does religious mean to you I think it means being saved and saying sorry for our sins and asking for forgiveness So that s like the main writing In my opinion of being religious I think that you take what you learn in a church s sermon and you use it in your world You know what I mean Yes If it s a very touching sermon and it s what you believe you can take it back and you can use it to help you go through problems or whatever and then I think also religious is that you re willing to share with other people Yeah You re not embarrassed You re not just holding back and keeping it to yourself No matter if people aren t religious and they ll come up to you and make fun of you here at school You re just willing to put it aside I used to go to a different school I don t remember now But he was a very very very good student And for some reason they did want to I don t know why I didn t figure it out The pastor got fired because it was just a job to him He did something very very inappropriate that a pastor could do with another person within church And he left because he was so embarrassed Why would he have been embarrassed I would have felt bad not just embarrassed And he was married You know what I said about you have to be willing to share Well there was this one pastor Let me turn the camera on you Hold on So there would kind of be a way of saying that it doesn t really work out So if both sides are Okay All right Regan let s hear again what you said about the deleting why would you thought you would delete it Oh I m not the one who said delete Oh okay I said delete it because I know people that are not atheist who are not Yes ma am I will tell her Thank you Scarlet Vicki is not here today Thank you ladies for getting quiet when the intercom rang Now discuss continue They re still Christian but they re still just as good as any other person would be That s why I think we should delete it But I don t know Okay Maybe it s the way she put it because she said it changes you inside but being Christian it does kind of change you inside Okay So you have a person in your life that you consider to have some qualities that make them a really great person but they are not religious Yeah They re not atheist but they re not Christian Okay Do you have anybody in your life that s not religious that you find a lot of good qualities My grandpa He s not saved but he still believes I guess it just depends on how the person acts Okay How about you Do you have anybody in your life Yeah named Delaney she s an older person But she really really likes her house and stuff And would you consider her to have qualities that make a really great person Yes But you would not consider her religious Oh no But she is not really atheist but she doesn t believe in anything But she doesn t believe in being atheist So we re kind of on the fence on this one in that some people think it needs to be deleted and others think no it makes a difference Do you know anybody who says that they are religious and they don t have qualities of a great person Yes Some people as soon as they get out of church they ll go out and do stuff that wouldn t be religious Yeah It s kind of like they don t have a Christian background They ll sit in the church room and they say I m a Christian because I m here at church but really you go do this at other places So then I guess it all boils down to what do you believe or what do you think that religious means A lot of people would say Oh I m religious but then like you said spend the rest of the week doing things Yes But they re kind of being truthful if they say they re not religious and they re not really religious So it s kind of two things so truthful but they re not religious Or maybe being a fake Christian like sitting in church They ll watch a football game just waiting for church to end But maybe that s kind of worse than saying I m not a Christian but also be a good person Okay So you re the leader in this group Why don t you poll each other again and see if they want to now delete other people Okay So go ahead and ask Okay So I put I m not sure yet We re still not sure That s fine That s fine If we re not sure yet we don t have to put it in one side or the other yet if we re not done discussing it This may be one that the group can t agree on I think it s a good thing to have but you don t have to have it to be a good person Yeah I think we can just delete it It is good to have but people can be really good people and not be religious Everybody agree with that If you re still thinking No I don t want to say that this is the safe place to say that Nobody s going to kick you Because even religious people can also be 
Okay But before you check over what you need to make sure you do All of it Get it completed right Okay awesome So your goal would be to Get homework completed Wonderful Okay Excellent Okay Now I brought some extra markers and stuff here because I know you re a visual learner that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your learning styles test So this is for you to do You can choose any colors to make it look however you want Okay So you ve got your goal and then we need to figure out why is that goal important So your goal is to Get all homework done Excellent And why is that important Because when you re in fourth grade you don t get all your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence I ve been there a couple of times and is not very fun and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels hmm So if you don t do your homework You re on a boring fence Okay You have to stand by the fence at recess And if you do do your homework you go to Hotshots Homework Hotshots And that is What do you have to do to qualify for Homework Hotshots Do all your homework for all the Oh Wow So All your homework throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go get to be a Homework Hotshot which means you go to Hot Wheels and enjoy the day skating Excellent Okay So you just brought up a good point umm So this goal is important because not only do you not want to stand by the fence and you want to be a Homework Hero What s going to happen if you do your homework You go to Hot Wheels You go to Hot Wheels and what do you think What effect is that going to have on your report card here If you re doing all your homework what s going to happen to those grades You get all the grades go up like the 100 200 That s right Very good All right So go ahead write that down Why you think homework is important Excellent So this goal is important because you can always get good grades and homework is a way that teachers help the students reinforce the things that they are learning in class So that s an excellent way to get good grades Okay So we know our goal and we know why it s important So let s think about what kind of rewards we re going to get for reaching that goal You get achievement awards You go in a limo with the principal And you go out to eat and Hot Wheels too right So those are some long term goals over the next nine weeks You get to complete your homework the next nine weeks You get to go to Hot Wheels and might even be on the principal s honor roll to take the limo ride Pretty cool huh Okay So that s here We ve got Don t forget one thing that you get to drink soda while you re going You do I didn t know that I ve never been in there I ve never been in the limo but I heard Oh my goodness Well that certainly is a nice incentive something to motivate huh Good So that s kind of a long term motivation We ve got to work hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that right Okay So we ve got here When I meet my goal for the quarter Quarter is another way of saying the nine week time period you will what What do you get to do if you do all your homework over the nine weeks I will go in a limo Well that s for principal s honor roll which is definitely an option What s specific for homework umm When I meet my goal for the quarter I will go to Hot Wheels Go to Hot Wheels Awesome Excellent So the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away can t it Okay Because nine weeks is not easy They are not easy to do your homework Because it s a long time before you go to Hot Wheels and we only have eighteen weeks in school So it s easier sometimes to stay motivated and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on more of a short term basis Meaning that instead of waiting all nine weeks to go to Hot Wheels which you will get to do if you meet your goal Let s think of something that we can do maybe once a week That would be a good incentive for you Study Okay Well studying is part of your homework plan Let s say that you study and you turn all your you do all your homework and at the end of the week when I check in with you when I check in with Miss Butler and I check in with your granny and I d say So how did Annamarie do Did she get all her homework done mm hmm And they say Yes she did What do you think might be something that you re willing to work towards here at school that would be a reward once a week I will come to you and I will help you You d like to help me All right So could we agree that let s say I check in on Fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out did she do her homework What are they going to tell me Yes Yes And then on Fridays you get to come and help me mm hmm That d be wonderful Now I teach a first grade class every day at 12 10 I know you do a really good job helping out at home with your niece But she I do not get to see her Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday But on Friday I do Because my mom My mom watches her And sometimes when my sister and I and the baby s not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and we talk to her on phone Awesome She s lucky to have an aunty like you Awesome Well I know because you do such a good job caring for her that you d be an excellent helper for me and my first graders Will that be a good goal for you Okay So our next section here Can you read this When I meet my goal for the week I will get to go to go to Hot Wheels I think Well Hot Wheels is for the whole nine weeks But each week Remember our What we re working towards on Friday that you get to come Help you Right So you get to come help Miss Charles on Fridays Okay You have very nice handwriting Thank you Okay So do you Thanks Okay So this goal is something that you re in charge of right You re in control of achieving this goal But you re not in it alone Because there s of a lot of people who want to see you reach that goal and to see you doing an awesome job at school So who are some of the people the adults in your life who are on your team who can be helpers for you as you reach this goal My grandma my aunty my uncle my mom and my sister Wonderful You have a lot of people So these are people at home that can help you reach your goal all right So let s go ahead and put those down for supporters at home Awesome All right So you ve got a lot of people supporting you at home I ve got five And how about here at school Who s on your team Miss Butler and Miss Charles You ve got it girl I can t wait to support you on this goal Okay So the people who can help me at school is Miss Charles Is it okay if I put in Miss Ficker my assistance teacher because she helps too Definitely That s a great person to add And so are you Thank you Okay I just realized something What s that All these teachers name has a R in it Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker It s a good attention to detail you have there Okay So we know that our goal is to get all my homework completed Okay And it s important because you can always get good grades Excellent Now on the short term if you re doing a great job getting your homework done every week Each week you will get to come help come help Miss Charles on Friday Excellent And I will know that you re doing a great job because you can ask Miss Butler my grandma and me That s right Okay And over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what s your reward I get to go to Hot Wheels Awesome And then although you re the one in charge of this goal there s a lot of people on your team Who are those people on your team from home My Mama my granny my sister my Uncle TJ and my aunty People on you re side All right And then when you re here at school who s on your team Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker Awesome All right So what do you think How s the school going to go It s going to be great because I will follow all of these Good and I m here to help okay All right Well I think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we manage our time really well And I know we talked a little bit before about kind of your month We looked at the month of February and figured out what big things you have coming up What portions of the day you spend here at school or at Church and what you do how you help out taking care of your niece So that s the month of February So what we re going to do today is really focus on this week and make a plan So what I ve done here is based on the information you told me before we ve got this week starting with today Monday February 7th and you will notice I ve the time of day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till Yeah 10 at night So I have these spaces blocked off So what are you usually doing Monday Wednesday Friday from 7 to 4 Come to school You re at school right So this whole area Is school Is school That s right You re here at school Will you write school Sure Sometimes it s easy for me if I just draw a line to show that Like that Okay School Okay So knowing that you re in school from 7 to about 4 O clock and we also need to think about some other regular things that you do during the week So you told me before that 
 Okay so They re equal because of Right Angles Theorem You are skipping a step Again Trevor tell him the definition of an altitude You tell me I have an altitude You have to tell me then what s the consequence of an altitude Read the definition of an altitude Say it The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle I don t know how to word that right but Somebody help him out He s making sense but somebody Yes Alright It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly if that s a word Don t say through because an altitude is bounded It starts at a vertex and it goes Okay so Now Isaac What should be the consequent step two there Right here Yes Whatever they gave you in those definitions Trevor s and the improved definition by Trey nobody said anything about congruent angles What did we talk That they re both right angles That they re right angles No we didn t That BD is perpendicular to AC Ah ha That s what I got Nice That s what it is So just write on top of that honey Right here Yeah the step two you should have that Right You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that s what reason says It comes from a defintion And why is that because of Tell him Why is that Definition of altitude Definition of altitude Okay You see how when we were working with the picture we put those boxes on the triangle What did those boxes say indicate That they re right angles They re right angles okay So that should be And why do we have right angles Somebody tell me Why do we have right angles Definition of perpendicular lines Yes That s a consequence if you have perpendicular lines So I m going to write ADB and CDB are right angles Yes Yeah Okay You guys the rest of you might have started with the fact that it s an angle bisector right Yeah Yeah And that s okay if you started with that It s okay Doesn t matter You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD You don t have to start with a given but that s traditionally the way we do it I can t believe I got this It s because of It s the definition of perpendicular lines What s this Okay wait Breathe in and out Now let s go see what s going on Okay step to the side ADB and CDB Okay Still you need to have an angle a side and an angle Do you have a congruent angle After all that work I m going to do that now Okay what are you going to put Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles Nope Right Angle Congruency Right Angle Congruency Theory Well I haven t What is the definition of right angle That all right angles are congruent What s the definition of a right angle 90 degrees It measures 90 degrees Yeah yeah All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he s writing Okay let s see what we have If you would number them that would help That s one And what s the consequence for after one I m trying I am old and somewhat blind from here But I know Is that a 2 right under that At the perpendicular line you have 2 What is that AD is perpendic No after that Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB Wait He wrote it It s all jumbled up and it s all there so But wait a minute Let s make sense out of this because it has to flow okay You know when you have your perpendicular line What should be at the perpendicular line The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines is what That the angles are Somebody somebody That they re right angles I want to say that but then I just don t want to say something that s wrong No you re fine You were not here yesterday And it seems you re doing great Hey so take the blue marker so that everybody can see Take the blue marker because I would like to re number it so they can see it okay So re number them again One is the given the altitude So you want me to write over Yes And then that s two Now what should be three Don t put three on that one What should be three Somebody tell him What should be three The angles The right angles Yes Okay now honey after you have right angles what are you going to say That uh Definition of Right Angle Theorem No Okay so right angles What happens after right angles Because remember angles are angles I need to talk about angle congruency But you haven t said that You talked about right angles So now what are you going to say You have it there honey Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE Okay so that should be the next step That s four Okay you remember Good Great Remember when I asked you at the beginning when we first started doing proofs to keep track So you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle Yeah right here Not yet we haven t touched that guy yet We don t even have a number for that guy He s just floating in there What angle is congruent to what angle Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle Yeah ADB is You just did right Okay go cross out one of the As I don t think you specifically did this but I ve noticed that some of you I ve noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you Taylor that you were always After you prove something you found it within your proof You would kind of cross it out in here Okay I found this Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here It s like you re taking attendance I need angle for an angle I already have an angle Keeping going See what I m doing here I showed you this way back Yeah He s probably getting confused because of number three How he put ADB because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB Wait what what what Number three The original number three Yeah The B should be in the middle instead of D It should be ABD and DBC That s right That s why That s why Yeah I didn t noticed that Yeah I thought he put that You guys are smart Yeah that s how you got confused with everything else Okay so now segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property so that s another side And then it s given that BD is an angle bisector so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD Okay but the issue here is he hasn t listed that as a given right Just like people say Well you re making that up How do you know that And you just say It s given but you didn t write it Yeah he did Yeah yeah he did It s right there It s number four He just did it wrong It s backwards It s all there So that should be step Wait a minute One two three four five Four should be one Whoa Three should be two One should be So there s a one two three four and then five Wait five right here Six right above it six seven Okay can you change the numbers Fix the numbers Yeah please fix the numbers It s there Okay we got it We have an angle bisector the consequence of an angle bisector We have an altitude the consequence of an altitude We have reflexive property so do you have them all Yeah So what could you say now The triangle I m going back to the black marker Okay let s get him out of the hot seat okay Micah Yes Micah You tell us is he finished with the proof No Why Because you said no Who said no You But okay you re supposed to tell me if there s something Well you have to put that it is the I don t know Frank to the rescue He hasn t proved that it s isosceles yet And how do you prove that it s isosceles I don t really know That sounded so tough Frank Yes Okay you say segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C Wait how do you say it CPCTC Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent I always mess it up I can t do the CPC I can t do that I say the whole thing Okay now Frank is he finished I think Is he No Not yet No he s not Okay why Tell him why Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC So what should be his number 10 Triangle ABC is isosceles And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle Yes I m so proud It keeps getting better I told you it would get better Teamwork I was stressing last night because I was like it s so hard Okay you guys understand what this means but I m trying to hurry it Good job Isaac Yeah Isaac a good job Very good Isaac One big clap for Isaac one two three Alright Yeah You did good Okay so You know what This is the proof that the new program where I give you because I want to make sure you get it enough information to do this on our own okay And then I m not going to write it out We re going to talk about how to do it And then you re going to complete it tonight at home So what do we need to do What is given there Jonathan What s given The middle one This one honey CB is an angle bisector of ACB CD is an angle bisector of ACB Okay what does that give you Once you have an angle bisector No that s not it Don t look at that one That s a totally different proof This is one that I m going to give you tonight So what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean 
 I think that Igneous and Metamorphic they re the least there are two books that don t use em cause they re Well my Igneous Yeah it Igneous and Metamorphic cool off and react And only a few particles came off but I was Yeah it s just awkward because mine was boosting most of yours Well yeah When I did my alien on my first try it was 42 grade Then now when I m measuring it again it was 22 grade It Mine never changed all it did was lost a little bit of it s rice crispies That was mine But I feel like Igneous rock like 20 Well yeah Cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock s outside And Mine was the same as Igneous and metamorphic And so if I d shake it like through weathering a bunch of rock would fall off I haven t done anything yet It was three I can t wait to Oh I have to say the one with the marshmallows cause it s Well for my Sedimentary it was harder Yeah mine too What Cause when I did mine only one piece of my Sedimentary broke apart and The Sedimentary My Igneous rock It has like almost It might be a little inaccurate since these are not real Sedimentary rocks You have to keep that in mind Well yeah So but what if they were real Sedimentary Would we be able to tell what they are Yeah Obviously Do you know any Sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar Yes I saw them in my yard They re called a granola ball No That was probably granite which is an Igneous rock For Jeanie do we write just how many lasts Cause mine must ve had Okay so when I when I did the blendering of my Sedimentary I lost only three grams off of my Sedimentary rock So I m not sure what would happen if I add these two Because of the heat out of the cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue Metamorphic rocks what would happen was the heat would melt it and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil Yeah that s how that happens because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while Yeah Like last we and like have you ever heard of a rock that s called Metamorphic rock Yeah It can be greasy Let s talk about why we use the models Obviously you re never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that s like the taffy Why did we use the Laffy Taffy for our model Because the heat and the pressure the heat and the pressure would like stick together but like a Sedimentary rock We use our fingers to add that heat pressure We had to simulate it somehow we couldn t do the actual Earth process in the classroom Do you agree with that Mm hmm Okay so you understand why you understand why we use that material for our model Okay Right it probably melts And why did we use the microwave for the Igneous rock Because What were we trying to simulate there From Magma is a really hot substance and this is what Igneous rocks can form from Could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom No No Could we work a marshmallow Yep So we understand the connection there We re trying to use materials that we can bring into the classroom but that will still simulate lava magma the processes Okay So pressure I think it has less effect of all the It had a lesser effect going through the processes of Of both Weathering And erosion And erosion okay Now you guys can think about this if you didn t like the samples and examples up here that I used you could always do it different Food material To make up your own experiment later Okay Let s talk for a moment Why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion Why are we measuring again Look at your rock samples do they look the same as what we measured in here No No What happened You have to measure the difference The difference and why would there be a difference What could we do to our rock samples Changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them Let s use the same what did you use when you pre measured I would keep it the same Why would I keep it the same Because it s Can we compare centimeters to inches Yes You can Think about that because later when you have to come back and do the difference how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches How can you compare those two measurements You re telling me you wanna go centimeters here but inches down here I would keep it the same They would make it mathematically You working on your difference Your difference in mass This your pre mass Explain to me how you got to that Where are the books They might add on to another sedimentary rock cause it s like never ending For some reason my Sedimentary and my Igneous rock They both lost a half inch in length Yeah mine too In my igneous rock grams it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams Mine lost no grams Mine gained grams Your gained grams Yeah I had 17 grams I had 17 grams and then it came back to 21 And this one went up one Because when this one went up three Maybe you should check that over Cause it weathers and erodes away Well I m guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people s stuff went into mine and made it bigger Cause it can do that it can See Right there All around the Oh I see it See Other bits and pieces of other people s went into mine and made mine bigger With mine a bunch of bits and pieces And mine started to melt Because your observations say it crumbles apart it s breaking apart and moving Okay what about these gaps here These gaps Yeah how you gonna do that For some reason my Igneous rock Into the sample It made it bigger Made it heavier Did it have more mass after the Your protective sleeve s coming off That s a good possibility that might throw your measurements off Did it happen to anything else Any other sample Now you re working on a difference in You gotta find the difference in length and width and you re gonna find the difference in mass That s interesting you could explain that away right there Mm hmm isn t that the one Igneous the one you were saying got the strange results You can talk to me then Well that s probably how they make the canyons bigger Maybe because some of the rocks after rain and the sandstorms they could just pound together and make a big old rock So Okay so if it erodes off another rock I m listening are you talking about real life rocks when they really erode away Mmhmm And it starts to rain cause a lot of times it s like wind and rain A lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain with the rain and here s another rock which makes a bigger You re thinking sometimes with real life rocks you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks Right do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary Those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock okay So that would also cause reason for your measurements I like where you re going with that Try to make that connection You know Unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how metamorphic rock s not made of Laffy Taffy So how s this go back to rocks in real life Think about that Some of our videos that we were watching About what salts quartz in these two processes You have to let the water go down Cause the heat inside of it could ve frozen Cause they heat over there we had it kinda Whoa what s the answer 19 grams 19 Igneous Igneous How could you make that Explain it to your little sister She s not gonna be able to understand that she wasn t here What could you put on your rock cycle diagram Okay So you re gonna have This is 17 17 for what Igneous What about sedimentary Tell me how Sean needs help Um he needs help with Okay where he s trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock What do ya mean No I was saying that it may have gotten darker Darker because of the heat Yeah A lot of rocks do that Yeah But it could be jus the pink Yeah it could be I could write down that it could be pink Yeah what happened to my metamorphic rock is I can Yeah that s because of this thing in between our finger and Mine it didn t get darker than mine though So you could add that to what you put in So how would that affect our measurements How did it affect your width Igneous and sedimentary rock could Now talk to me though if it s in You wanna know why those are there Because a lot of rocks don t have protection that doesn t help them And a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag which mixed with the Sedimentary It could And sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around guess what it would do It would also become a sedimentary It s just like the rocks it s just like the rocks in life It s more similar to real life Yeah The eroded bits would stick to other rocks So I just added like bits We have bits and pieces See if I was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this this would also become this because this isn t on the mat This would begin to stick And when you ball it together it makes it appear coloring to it that show that it s inside there I think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock After each sample ones that were weathering and erosion So you re gonna compare your two measurements pre measurement post measurement to see if there s a difference for each rock Hmm Hmm Do we have to subtract Do we What s your key word that could tell you what to do Difference Go show me I know you re thinking You just told me what key word tells you what to do Where were we Finding the mass After we ve done the weathering and erosion Okay are you gonna get started Yes Yes Jack are you finished with that scale Can we use manners please Can we use manners Can you say please pass the balance Talk to me guys just for a moment about the differences in those in your We ve got Ashley s igneous we talked about that I figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen because they put the sedimentary came on to the metamorphic So we can see again how just and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag that s how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock And I think it became darker because the heat because of the pink And because of the pink Yeah Okay think about in real life sedimentary rock when those levels when those layers are smashed together Okay don t some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure Okay that was your metamorphic Yes Brooke And also you get the igneous in there it sticks to it and you can just put it inside there cover the layers off and it actually gets inside the metamorphic So you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks and how they could combine with one another and result in a completely different rock Okay So on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome Not the candy rock cycle the real one It says that you could use a diagram okay Using your textbook Level Readers Science Journal or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed Anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle Okay My igneous has gone down just a bit 
 So who can tell me in this group who can remind me what is our objective What are we discovering today in science I d like to see a lot of volunteers Lindsey We re seeing what soil holds water better and We re seeing which soil holds water better What s the term for that Holds water Chris It s absorbing the water What s absorbing the water The clay and the sand absorb the water Very good So we re trying to figure out which absorbs more water Clay or sand today Very good Who can tell me what was the first step that you did in this project Cameron First we poured in the sand What did you pour the sand into We poured it into a funnel Okay What s that thing on the funnel It s a coffee filter It s a coffee filter Why do we need a coffee filter on the funnel Because when it s on the funnel it makes it so that the sand doesn t run through the funnel Okay All right What s the second step Can somebody tell me what the second step is Cameron said you dump the soil sample whether it was clay or sand into your funnel What s the second step Caleb The second second step is to pour in the water The second step was to pour in the water Who can tell me what the third step is What s the third step Chris You record how long it took for it to drip every last drop into the cup of water What s it The water The water Good You re recording how long it took for all of the water what s that word called What did that water do to get from here to the surface to the bottom of the cup Cameron It drained It drained Very good What are you measuring in Are you measuring in seconds Are you measuring in minutes In hours Lindsey Measuring in minutes with the seconds You re measuring in minutes with seconds Okay Can you tell me how long your clay is up to for draining out the water Two minutes and a half Two and a half minutes Good Can you tell me Cameron how long it took for your water to drain through your sand It took 28 seconds Twenty eight seconds Good job Keep up the good work I really like all the diagrams that I m seeing Lindsey you did an excellent job at paying very close attention and following the steps in step by step order You can give yourself a point for science Good job Ladies can you tell me did your sand hold water Yes It did hold water How did you know that Because it absorbs some of the water I poured it in here and it had into the water so the sand holds 11 milliliters of water Good So you re saying that the sand held 11 milliliters of water You said that when you poured the water in through the sand then you dumped something in this graduated cylinder What did you dump in this graduated cylinder We dumped all the water that was in there What s there In the cup So you dumped all the water that was in the cup after what What did the water do in order to get in the cup It drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So it drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So then you took your water and you poured it in your graduated cylinder Luana you said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11 milliliters Why did you do 40 minus 29 Because that s how you find out how much the sand is holding That s how you find out how much the sand is holding How did you know to start with 40 Because we poured 40 milliliters of water in the cup to start Oh To start you poured 40 milliliters of water in You took the water that you had to start and took away the amount that was left which you got 11 milliliters Very good Excellent Gentlemen what are you noticing about sand and water We re noticing about the sand this time it took us two minutes and eight seconds for it to stop dripping We started out with 40 milliliters and What did you do with that 40 milliliters of water We poured it into the strainer to drain it down into the cup and when we poured into the cylinder we had 28 and a half milliliters Very good How do you figure out how much water is in the sand What subtraction sentence would you do Forty minus 30 So you re rounding up You said you had to 30 Yes That s a very good choice You re going to do 40 minus 30 so that tells you how much water is in the sand which is One 10 Ten what Milliliters Ten milliliters Very good Do you think some of that water s still in the funnel Because this funnel is still dry This funnel feels wet Do you think some of that 10 milliliters of water is in this not funnel in this filter Yes Do you think so Why do you think that Because it s soaked and some of the water might have stopped in there because it was so thick and sandy And now it s a little bit thinner Keep up the great work Sam and Madison what are you noticing about water with your sand and water with your clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay Have you figured out yet which one holds more water Clay The clay holds more water If you were a gardener and if you were planting a garden what would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay Sand Why s that Because it drains water better and the drainage would get to the plants faster Okay So the drainage would get to the plants faster Where do the plants need the water Roots At the roots What do you think Madison I would do a mixture of sand clay and humus because mixed together it s loamy and loamy soil is good for the plants Great observation That s wonderful So you said you d mix all of them together because that would make a loamy mixture which would allow the gardeners to get the best soil for the plants to grow Very good Nice job What are you three noticing about water and sand and water and clay Water and sand it can absorb through the sand the water And through the clay it soaks and at four minutes You re almost at four minutes for your clay Wow What do you think this shows you about what happens on a rainy day whether it s outside in our soccer field Or what happens on a rainy day in your backyard Does anybody want to tell me what happens The clay it gets very muddy because the water is pouring down on it It might make a puddle because some of the soil on the ground can t hold itself so it might make a puddle Good So Matthew when you poured your water into your clay did you have a puddle at the top of your clay Yeah we had a puddle at the top of our clay because it was leaking little drops and it stayed on top of the clay We had to wait a long time till we could pour more water What stayed for a long time on top of the clay The water did because it didn t have small particle sizes so it was hard for the water to get through Oh so the clay has small particle sizes so it s hard for the water to get through Wow Good job What does that mean about the particle size for the sand It means that the particle for sand is bigger and it has more space for the water to drain through Good Excellent Did any of you draw diagrams of what your experiment set up looked like What it looked like I think you have a diagram on the previous page Did you draw a diagram Yes Okay What did your diagram show My diagram for sand shows that the water is going right through the funnel and it s pouring to the bottom And for my clay it s little drops because the clay is stuck together once it has water Good I can easily tell in your diagram which one s sand and which one s clay One suggestion that I can make to you though is I would like a few more labels If I were to never see this experiment before how would I know that this is sand and that this is clay So if you could label those for me and tell me what these drops are I don t know if they re water or or milk If you could do a little bit more labelling for me that would be excellent Good job Nice work Very impressive How long are you guys up to for your water being through your filter through your clay Five minutes and 45 seconds Five minutes and 45 seconds I can tell that both of you are working very hard And Xavier you re doing excellent job at staying in your seat the whole time You can give yourself a point right now for being on task Nice job Good What are you noticing about sand clay and water I noticed that the clay held less water than the sand and I was really surprised by that because I thought that water can go through sand fast So you were really surprised because you didn t think water would go through sand that fast And how much water did your sand hold Our sand held 11 milliliters Eleven milliliters Good And how much did your clay hold do you know Five Held five milliliters Wow What number sentence did you do in order to figure out how many milliliters were in the clay and how many milliliters were in the sand We did 40 minus however the milliliters were left in the cup Okay And why did you do that Because we had 40 to begin with and we needed to find out how many were left and I forgot You forgot Kendall can you help her out We got 29 in this and it began with 40 So we had to do 40 minus 29 Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters Milliliters Good Remember millimeters is when we re using rulers and milliliters is when we re measuring water Okay Excellent job Which soil would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay I would garden with both of them so I could get a loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers Okay So you would mix them together so that you could get a loamy mixture What about you Kendall I would do sand because water can get through it easily So water can get through it easily Why would that matter Because the soil and everything else and the grass and everything needs water but if you use clay it just stays on top and it can t get water Very good Excellent Looks like you girls are ready to move on to your graphing What are we going to graph What are we graphing today How much water is in the 
 Welcome to Mrs Dunford s first grade classroom Here you see a Word Work center where students are working to build words All around the room student work is proudly displayed along with anchor charts to anchor student learning At Computer Center students are working on differentiated computer programs based on needs At Listening Center students listen to stories to build their fluency Above them is our Word Wall which displays our sight words Our Center Chart The students are working on the Smart Board to integrate technology into reading Here we have students at Read To Someone where they are enjoying reading books to each other Around the back of our room books are separated into book bins for genres and they have their book boxes At Read To Self area students read independently and enjoy reading in our tent In the back we have our marble jar for compliments and our How Was Your Day board along with our Helper Chart And last we have My Table where I work with small groups based on needs Thank you for joining our classroom Okay boys and girls we just read the biography by Maurice Sendak Can you tell me what is a biography Let s see Cassandra A real story A real story you re right Kiss your brain What is it a real story about Christopher It was a real story about Maurice Sendak It s a real story about Maurice Sendak A real story about a real what A real author A real author Could it be about something other than an author Yes Yes as long as it s about a person right A biography tells us about a person We re going to fill in this graphic organizer about Maurice Sendak It has different sections in it The first section says Childhood Can you read that with me Childhood The middle section says Life What does it say Life And that last section says Books What does it say Books Good And we re going to fill things in from down here to tell about his childhood what happened in his life and some books that he wrote Can you help me fill those things in If you re ready to help me can I see your hands up Good Put your hands in your lap We re going to read this one first Worked at a toy store Can you read it with me Worked at a toy store Hmm where would that go Childhood Life or Books Andrea what do you think Life Life Why do you think that Because Because What did he do He wrote stories about He wrote stories but he worked at a toy store and that happened during his what Life It happened during his life you re right Go ahead and move this to where it says Life Good job We re going to give her a McDonald s cheer ready Ba da da da da I m loving it Good job Let s read this one Where The Wild Things Are Can you read with me Where The Wild Things Are Hmm where does that one go Grace Books Why do you think that it goes in Books He wrote it He wrote it you re right Can you move it where it goes We ll move it just a little bit closer There you go Good job We are going to give her the Truck Driver ready Good job there buddy Oh but this one down here Born in Brooklyn Can you read it with me Born in Brooklyn Where would that one go Stephanie Life It could go in his life Why do you think that it goes in his life Because he was born in Brooklyn Because he was born in Brooklyn that s a fact about his life Where else could it go When you re born you re a what Baby You re a baby So where else could that go Childhood It could go in Childhood you re right Good job We re going to give her a Fantastic ready You re fantastic Good Let s look at this one Won Caldecott Medal Can you read it with me Won Caldecott Medal Hmm when did that happen Houston In his life In his life Why do you think that it happened in his life Because he wrote a book and he got it for his book You re right Exactly right He wrote a book and he won it about a book Would you put in Life You re right it went in Life Perfect Good job Let s give him the Piano ready Dun dun dun dun You did a good job So Kenny s Window Can you read it with me Kenny s Window Where would Kenny s Window go Dylan Life Is Kenny s WIndow something that happened in his life You can change your answer Um Where do you think Kenny s Window would go Books You re exactly right Dylan Why would it go in Books I don t know Okay let s talk about it Kenny s Window Was that a book that he wrote Yes Yes So would that go in Books for that reason Yes Yes So can you move Kenny s Window to Books Yep You ve got to touch it a little bit harder I got it Okay good job Right there Dylan is good Thank you Dylan It s good there I ll move it up a little bit further There now it s out of the way Can I do this Okay you want to do the disco ball That s the way uh huh uh huh I like it uh huh uh huh That s the way uh huh uh huh I like it uh huh uh huh Good Let s look at the last one Liked bedtime stories Can you read it with me Liked bedtime stories Where would that one go Let s see Cassandra Childhood Childhood Why do you think that it would go in Childhood Because his grandpa and grandma read him some stories Because they read him stories didn t they Good job That completes our graphic organizer on Maurice Sendak Now I have your own biographies for you to read Everyone should know where they go And your own shoe biography for you to fill out because remember we re going to do a display in our hallway that s called Famous Footwear and have our shoes displayed for everyone else to see Alright right now I want you to stand up I want you to glue cotton on your shoes Stick some marshmallows in your mouth and go to your area to read your biography Alright I want you to sit a little more in a circle and then I want you to read two pages and then I want you to fill it out okay Can you read the title Can we read the title together Ready Joseph Burcheck Good Who s Joseph Burcheck Him Yep that s right Open up to page two Dalton There you go Stephanie can you start for us Joseph Burcheck grandma and grandpa There were lots of beautiful plants and hills where they live Grandma had many books she liked to read and so did Joseph Good Stop there and look at your graphic organizer Look at your shoe Is there a part of that shoe that you can fill out Yes Which part do you think You think Family And you think Childhood Dalton Let s start with Family What part do you think would go in Family Grandma and grandpa Grandma and grandpa That he did what with Grandma and Grandpa Read books He read books with them What else did he do with them Can you re read this part There were a lot of beautiful plants and hills where they lived They lived What do you think that means That he what with his Grandma and Grandpa Lived He lived with them that s right So can you write that in Family Put that in Ideas And then let Dalton tell you what he thinks goes in Childhood okay Got it What do you guys filling in How do you spell lived L No lived L I V E D Who does his live with He cheated Grandma and Grandpa His Grandma and Grandpa Is that what you were going to add to the graphic organizer You re exactly right You re doing a good job Jenn I think she needs the marker There you go Keep it up Keep up the good work H E R A N Her family was quick to hang up her work Your turn Her family was quick to hang up her work Nice job And we have a Family section on here so what do you think Dylan What did her family do Put her pictures up That s exactly right they hung up her work Good job Dylan I m going to show you where Right here T H E Do you know why they re putting that in Family Can you tell me Because her family did what What did her family like to do Put pictures up Hang up her pictures that s exactly why they re adding it to Family Go ahead and finish what you need to write You ve got to finish it Dylan You re doing a great job There you go her work Why is this a biography Because it tells by a girl and she s writing books And she was reading books and writing You re right it s a biography A biography is a story about a real person and that s exactly what she was Can you read me one of these When Amy was little she liked to read Good And why does that belong in Childhood Because she was doing it as a child She was doing it when she was little You re right You re exactly right Now who s going to fill in the ideas Who knows where did she get her ideas from Do you know where she got her ideas from From the books From the books Well actually where did she get the ideas for the books Can you read this part for me Amy liked about a lot of books Things people say help Amy What helps Amy Things people say Things people say So where does she get her ideas from People People and the things that they tell her right Things that they say Can you write that in the Ideas part Yes Good job The things that people say are what help her and give her ideas Houston can you help her direct that That would be great You guys are doing a fantastic job Oh you wrote the wrong stuff You re writing on the wrong side You re writing on the wrong side She s writing that whole section Why Can someone tell me why she s writing that in Childhood Clint do you know Why is she writing that in Childhood Why is she writing that Joseph did things with his Grandpa in Childhood Because he used to watch him play guitar and go in the woods with him and talk nice Did he do that when he was an adult or when he was a child Child Right so is that why it would go in Childhood Yes Jeffrey can you tell me what is this story about It tells real stuff It tells real stuff about what Joseph Burcheck Joseph Burcheck yep That s what it does It tells real things about him You guys are doing great Keep up the good work 
 So what about this part Is this any different or is this part the same as last time It s different because Well Let s let Rileen talk Chris It s different because it s wider and it got right to here and the other one came up to there It s like six more it s like ten more centimeters than last time Okay So once you guys finish with your observations you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta See this part is completely dry It s pretty much almost half Water s above the side Watch that watch that it s gonna fall Look at that It s like a boat going down a waterfall That was sand I know The water has stopped going One minute s passed Thirty Oh There s a start to get ready It s not done playing It s still not done Well the water Look at this look at this I know we re still dry There s a pool of water at the end There s a pool of water at the end Look at this there s a dent there s a dent Oh wow Right here s dry Okay why do you guys think this part didn t get any water Because it probably went under So Cameron says it went under Xander what were you saying It was going too fast and it didn t it was probably right here so it didn t decide to go all the way over here and it went right here It formed a lake right here It went the easiest route So it s got eight or nine minutes So now ten nine minutes Is water still draining Yeah the water s still there When are you guys gonna decide when the end time is When this goes There s been nine minutes right And the water is dripping Last time we got 15 minutes The water s dripping into basin Last time we got 15 minutes So how does it all compare Because um it compares because it s almost the same and look at it like poured a pool or something Cameron you were saying this one is almost the same Like it took the same amount of time No No No I m saying it s getting there No the other one s longer because it drained a bigger whole Yeah So Elondra how was the time different for this one How it was like similar Let s hear what Elondra says This one went faster This one went faster Yeah way faster So you re saying it s similar not too different But Elondra s saying it went faster Do you agree with her Yeah and the deposition it s like way over here Way across there You guys are I think pretty much done with your water draining now Okay so Nine or ten minutes and it s done So you guys want to record your end time No no it s still going It s okay if there s still a little bit of water left in Once it stops draining you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements Where do we get the toothpicks Don t we have to know what time it is 10 30 right Was this when the chocolate melts When s the chocolate melt Elondra What It looks like chocolate So are you guys ready to start taking your measurements Yeah Why don t you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you and I ll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing Yeah I think the widest part is right here Can I do the poking Huh Can I do the poking You guys have your measuring tape out We have to go get the measuring tape Tape that back up Here our widest part is right here Widest part is that No no no you re not supposed to poke it How long is that It s about to here Okay we got what we need Go from centimeters Centimeters Aw Cameron Cameron you messed it up That s not our longest part Our longest part is this Okay we have to redo it Wait where does we start Right here Here you do the poking Don t poke it into the thing but how deep is it Here grab it No you re not supposed to do that Remember what she did Okay this right here It s about three centimeters Three centimeters So depth of straight channel is three centimeters Okay what do we measure next Okay time to do the width How much was it Three centimeters Three Okay What s the widest Where s the measuring tape Around six centimeters How much Six Six centimeters Six Okay now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel It s all this it s all from right here It s from here to here You guys we need the tape measure Yeah width from here to here No it s this long I ve got it with my fingers This long It s about 15 No it s 14 and a half No that s 15 Yeah 15 Oh yeah 15 Same with the other one 15 It goes all the way to the end Yeah length Okay 29 How many 29 Yeah and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick So right here Right there yeah Okay where s the time Okay so can you hold that there How much is it Five centimeters How many Five Five c m Okay width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So right here We re gonna actually move to here No no width Oh width Looks about 11 centimeters maybe 11 centimeters Alright length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So now we re measuring that Here you can do it So what re you guys working on measuring now Length We ve got a long length 27 28 28 yeah 28 centimeters Jorge you can measure Now what do we measure Depth of soil dropped at end of the Wait what was it 28 Depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick I m letting Jorge do it Okay Jorge you can do this one So maybe poke it here Poke it in there Now put your finger down Put your finger down where it is Slide it down until you feel the dirt Good Bring it over to Kendra So you can kinda see the dirt right there That s not even a centimeter You start here Okay That s not even a centimeter That s three millimeters So we round it down to zero centimeters Okay Zero Okay we re all done No we still have to Work on your bird s eye view picture in your notebook Up in the big can Oh no they re over there Okay The same bird s eye view or a different view That s what I was going to I m especially gonna draw in here because that s really interesting Really interesting Did Cody just go get something Yes he did Oh my gosh he s so nice So did you guys finish taking your data Yeah we re gonna do our bird s eye view Before you guys look at your bird s eye view I want you to share What d you guys find from your data So let s look at your data tables for a minute Okay It kind of made like a cave No right here Yeah So I see the difference right here In the depth of the stream channel the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river What was more Like in centimeters so one centimeter off So Alejandro s looking at the depth of the stream channel and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep So last time it was actually deeper How about which one was wider The rushing river So the rushing river made a wider stream channel Yeah I think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in It basically didn t spend enough time going in it basically just went Yeah and it made it more curved inish and stuff Okay Jorge what d you notice I noticed that right here it made a little cave and I think something like water I think there was a little whirlpool there Yeah there was There were a bunch of whirlpools Yeah there were doubles There s one right here and here So I think it broke the water I saw one little whirlpool right there and another one over here I saw one here So the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places Yeah I think it s cause it curves like that so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water s coming through Yeah so the water s So what about the delta The deposition How is this different than your first experiment Oh my gosh it was five centimeters bigger Five centimeters bigger What d you notice Jorge The biggest part was that it was only this part right here Okay Yeah that was the longest part that was part of it all So Cody I noticed that this time how deep was your delta Our delta which would be to get that soil Yeah Zero centimeters So does that mean there s no delta So how did you guys come up with zero Cause it was three millimeters so we had to round down Okay so you guys have your data And the length of the soil It was a lot wider wasn t it Yeah the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger It was from the end right here and it continued down So you guys remember we re gonna take this data Someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here Oh put more of the earth material in Yeah And see what it would be like if you added more material Okay maybe that would be a question we could investigate Maybe the delta would be thicker because there s not enough room for all of it You know why I m asking you that Because I think it would be deeper because right here it only makes little ones here but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space Okay So you think these channels might be bigger Yeah If there was more earth material What if we made an even bigger hole Oh so you re wondering if it was an even bigger flood what might happen Maybe that would be a hole like this big Yeah you guys are doing that thing that scientists do after they do an investigation they start asking more questions I wonder what if we tried this So you guys have got your data so we ll be ready to put this in the class data table right Find our averages probably on Thursday Right now you guys are going to be working on you want to make sure you get the runoff sample draw what that looks like today we ll see what it looks like when it settles out later and then you guys are going to work on your bird s eye view and think about where s the humus where s the gravel where s the clay so you can add that into the picture Hey guys I m gonna like Yeah I was thinking the same thing like rip this up Whoa there s the biggest Oh that s cool Ms Maher it made a big dip I m guessing that some water s still down there 
 I don t want a straight line No I like curves Yeah a lot Because the friction in the air Yeah Pushes it and the gravity going on the next turn I think it s because there s like a big wall and that s a small little plane and everything has gravity You need to pull on the string And the reason why it s not going that way is because that wall will stray them away The wings get cool What was your longest throw How long was it Oh it was It was mine and it was probably one two three four five six Five No it s six One two three four five six Into the six but not before the six Oh yes into the six Alright Go over there check that out 38 Four hundred 538 centimeters Yeah Let s put how many meters Five meters Write 538 But why did because fliers don t go into the wall Because Everything has a little bit of gravity There s not a whole lot of gravity where it would just go Yeah and then that doesn t have a lot of gravity but I mean I can see that but he threw it high and it went up to the wall right there But it kind of did like that But it didn t really smash I mean it didn t go and stick Yeah it didn t go Gravity pulled it but it wasn t going to hold it there Yeah It s got more force on it Yeah I think there s more gravity up there than right here because that s higher and it s closer It s like it has a lot more gravity What has more gravity Up there Had more pull I think the reason why the sticks were going and the straw was going this way is because everything has a little bit of gravity And the wall And the wall it like a lot bigger than that stick and it s gravity that s pulling it there but it doesn t have enough gravity where it will just be like It s not like this Okay so if everything has a little bit of gravity what is the major gravity pull though that is bringing it down The Earth The Earth because That s why like if we threw this that s why That s why it chops Okay this one went it went three meters This one covered straw with paper and this one glides It s a lot bigger So when it went like here it went all the way down to the Yeah it s faster because it s bigger and this one s smaller and it doesn t go far Glider the other one s probably bigger This one s also flat so it s got a better chance to glide Yeah That one s like round and bigger and it doesn t flop on the and it doesn t go like far When you throw it it doesn t like when it goes it doesn t go far but this one like it ll go far What do you think would happen if we put a paperclip on either the front or the back It would help It would lay it a little bit down It would go a little bit down because it s it has more weight it ll go down If you put a paperclip on it like a paperclip s not that heavy but it would make it like when we fly it it goes up in the air and then comes back down and floats down That s why they re so short What makes it come down Gravity Okay And like you put a paperclip on it it ll come down Because the paperclip is heavier than the straw What if you put it on the back It would it would It would kind of slow it It would be like that Okay can you think of What about this one What if we put the paperclip on this one It would It wouldn t feel It would get worse If we put the paperclip on here then it would get all messed up because if it s flat and it s trying to It has weight it will just go Uh huh right That one when you fly it before we got the paperclip it goes high before it comes down But when we put the paperclip on it it goes straight down like that And like without the paperclip without the paperclip on it it will go like it will go like an ocean With the paperclip on there it would go farther It would go farther and then it ll fall just down like that but not go like that This one let s try this one See that one goes a lot farther And it probably goes farther because I put a lot of force on it If you even put a lot of force on this one it will go down because it flies like I threw it like that and it just flies off because it s the gravity And you throw that one it goes farther Okay so gravity makes it come down faster than the glider It makes it go down because if you just throw it without the paperclip it won t it will just come down because of gravity _ Yeah the straw one is going like that And then it just goes like see how it flips down But with the paperclip it ll go farther Like that Tyler what were you saying about the air Do you think that has a do you think that makes a difference in what Mary Morgan is saying this one kind of floats and then comes down Go talk about that See the air The air feels like windy in here It would push it and then it would It would go like this Yeah like that And it would just push It would just push it towards like where everything was Yeah and this one with the paperclip goes really far And that paperclip the reason it went far without the paperclip is because air pushed it and force What is that force called When you push it Remember it s called The thrust The thrust that s right So the thrust when you push the plane made a difference is that what you said Could you change the one with the straw is there any changes that you could make that you think would make it fly further Talk about that as a group Put two paperclips One on the front and one on the back Put the lighter one on the back Let s try that I bet it will It might go farther too Okay now push We have a paperclip on it and we re going to see if it goes farther the second time I think I bet it will go I bet it goes a lot longer That s fine Well It went to 10 It went to 10 Okay so I want you to discuss in this group I want you to discuss what you found when you threw when you tested this with the paperclip on it Just talk about that together Well So when there s air I think when they closed the air up it went in and back out But but but tied together So if you like flip off The paper clip The air like if you could do this and turn off the air it would go further But if you take off of it I mean if you it won t make it that far It will just be like The paper clip the straw it does help Yeah about the same as this one without I wonder what that one s like with paperclips Me too I want to try it This is my prediction I think it s on an angle I think that s going to go further I don t know because they don t have no air stream to hold it I think it will go farther I don t See Well you didn t put a lot of force on that one Well we all have to try But I still think it went the farthest but I think I think it s going to go farther Nope Well it went farther than you It went But I mean it didn t go You all tried it with this didn t you all Let me try it this way I tried it with that I tried it with that side It all went to the yellow but But it didn t Strong enough So what did we find out back here That it puts more weight on it so it goes What puts more weight This little paperclip The paperclip puts more weight to that one and it s not going to nose dive But I was standing right here and mine hit that wall And that s without the paperclip And then you put the paperclip on there it doesn t go near as far Why did that make a difference Was your throws the same Did you use the same amount of force What happened Mine felt like I was using the same force I think it s just because that since there isn t any air space on that one What do you mean airspace I mean like the air can t go through this Yeah like that s a straw it has a hole It s just putting more weight on that one so that s just going to go boop If you use this one and put the paperclip right here it s going to cut off the air coming in right here And that s going to go further Oh you re took off the air of the straw And that makes it go further Why does that Because the air in the straw is pulling it down because it s like Do you know what that s called Gravity Well the gravity but what about the air when the air is coming in Friction Oh friction Friction the air is causing friction Okay The air s slowing it down And also the air Okay now I want you to think about if you change this plane in any way what changes could you make to it to make it fly further We could cut it up Wrap around and then have that like this Yeah I think that s set to have the same throw Because actually having That one can go farther but the paperclips on it it won t fly further But if you put paperclips on this one it d probably go farther Put some paperclips on there Because paperclips add more weight Yeah and it lets it go further Here Tyler you want to throw That went two 
 And then with Carl s example was down to MSB marginal social benefit So how can we put that into words Marginal social benefit Andrew Isn t it something that can t really be measured Okay Yes and it s harder to measure but how would you explain it What is it Think about what we did in the example and say like everybody is benefiting from washing cars Right So what is It is a social benefit and it s what he gets from the society It s what society gets from you Yeah you re on the track but it s what we get from his interaction Right Okay So it s the benefit to society for whatever market that is Okay So social benefit this is going to be the additional benefit okay The additional benefit that society those that are not involved in the transaction but from society get from one more unit Okay Now I m going to put next to this slash costs Oh just kidding That s that s the other document So down here is just something is a negative thing So what this leads to Do you think these two definitions lead to positive externality or negative externality Positive Positive they re things that market itself does not take care of Okay Market obviously in this example does not take Carl and offer YTB for all of our benefits considering it doesn t pay him at all Right There are things in society that when you look at the actual amount someone is paid they re maybe not paid to the extent of the benefit they get Okay So right now if you flip over to the back we ll come back to definitions later flip over to the back Oh I m sorry on the other sheet because I didn t put it on the back on the other sheet you have two columns I want you first by yourselves without talking to someone else think of try to think of at least two examples where there are things in society where there are markets for these and it makes everyone better off because they re there and we all benefit from them Okay Go ahead write them down Think about it You really think you re going to have to defend it So think about on your own what markets are out there things that happen that benefit everybody not just the people participating in the market So benefits more people than are just paying for the service not just the buyers or the sellers of that service but outside of it people are benefiting from it Write and think and then we ll talk about them Write and think write and think Wait do we need negative ones too Just positive right now we re going to go back to the negative ones So just think of the positive ones right now Okay benefit people again let s cover the definition again Benefit people outside of the buyers and sellers in that transaction Okay So we re not talking about just the buyer of someone who goes to a store and buys something and the benefit they get from it that s marginal benefit but that person buying this gives other people benefit outside of that person But like if they built a hospital in the neighborhood and it has a reputation of being not like they don t have a lot of equipment it s not very good Then could you like the property values of the of the town go down So you could talk about Okay So you re on absolutely the right track so then that would be a negative Like so what could always be a positive benefit Okay Well let s talk about some of the negatives Some of you wrote some stuff down I saw Matt right away think of something what d you write down I said flu shots Okay Why Because the more healthy people there are around the less you ll I don t know The less sick people there are the more healthy people there are Overall right Because if one of you Think about this If one of us If half of the class gets flu shots and the other half doesn t that mentality shows us that now that other half is more likely to get the flu right So that is an absolutely Flu shots What could you make that into a broader explanation Vaccinations Vaccinations Okay Vaccinations So go ahead and write those two down because those two are textbook examples Is medicine good Medicine It depends if it s contagious but go ahead and be more specific so you want to put flu vaccine or any kind of vaccine It s a perfect example because that is a big issue right now A lot of parents are talking about not vaccinating their children because they re worried about issues of autism that have been indirectly slightly connected to it but for the most part that has not been proven yet so now we re seeing other ramifications of that decision Over here go ahead Pro sports Pro sports tell me why People who play get paid for doing it and the fans enjoy watching them Okay good So pro sports and we re not even talking about people that necessarily pay for the ticket to go You might just get to watch on TV A lot of times on the main stations you don t even have to pay cable lines So you would go ahead and benefit from those If you pay aren t you technically then part of that If you paid for it then you re part of that market So like vaccinations You pay for vaccine Okay But that person that pays for the vaccination doesn t get it but all of us benefit because that one student got the vaccine Okay So that s the key It benefits people outside of the one paying for it So that s why it s social Okay Sam YouTube Okay Tell me why Because people can freely put up any type of videos they want That uses creativity and people that want to hear music from anywhere can do it wherever they want Absolutely So YouTube is a great modern example because we all benefit from that kind of laughter that enjoyment It doesn t cost us anything People do it for their own interest and we all benefit Cody Education Education Tell me why Students learn and they get to do well in the world and then the world gets some technology Okay Good Like you brought up tax payers So your parents pay for your education in school Right But by the fact that you re becoming educated even if they pay for your college tuition Now you don t give back just to your parents with that education you give back to society overall Right To everyone hopefully in the world one way or another you end up giving back to society For more people than are paying for your education Okay Yeah Clean energy like electric cars or something because even if you yourself don t drive one that makes like it improves Okay Anything green Absolutely Anything green like that You can put green technologies benefit the world which kind of brings us to one that we re going to talk about with a negative Okay Yeah I just had a question Could you put stock like since if someone buys a stock it raises the price for everyone else Yeah I ve never heard that example but you could argue that It s still benefiting a select group though I guess in some stocks though that s millions and millions of people so I mean you might be able to argue I didn t know because they re still involved in the transaction They re only involved if it s their initial one So that s why I think it s worth some argument there You might be able to prove that I think some of the other ones across the board are a little bit more general but that s definitely something to think about Andrew Well see I agree with him because when the stock prices go up people see that as Oh the public is spending more so that would bring the economy up which would bring That s a really good point because that s an indicator of the health of the economy Right So by the stock market being high it makes everyone employ people Yeah that s a good extra point to add in Yeah What about something like sorry You were thinking of the same thing at the same time Alright go ahead So like taxpayers and the government pays them and even if you don t pay taxes you still benefit from it You could actually put public works down in your column because now that we ve kind of opened that can we can think about parks right And I get the example all the time There s a really nice park I live right by Glenn Ellen and I am not technically in Glenn Ellen but right by there then I go down there I run by the park I take advantage of that public area and I add to my benefit So just by having that park it kind of benefits more people than just the people that pay for it So any public works Police you could talk about firemen they benefit many more people than the people that pay for them The people that clear the snow off the roads Delightful Can I get some negative externalities then Flip it back over Let s go right on Flip it to the other sheet and let s go to the other thing here and then we ll start graphing it Marginal costs Let s put that in our own words here What is the marginal cost of these Everyone think about it for a second Think about it write down your own definition This is something you should know like the back of your hand at this point In your own words write down the definition of marginal costs Write it down you already did Marginal cost You got it Andrew What is marginal cost What is marginal cost The extra cost of hiring one additional worker Okay One more whatever it is It doesn t have to be a worker We re all thinking about workers because we just got out of inputs we just got out of inputs and factor markets and resource markets but remember those units one two and three they had marginal cost too If you picture a monopoly graph what does marginal cost look like on a monopoly graph Upward sloping Upward sloping right So we can think of the system in every unit So what does it need One the additional cost of what One more unit One more unit Let s just keep it like that because input is just factors One more unit because in a monopoly it s marginal cost of making one more unit In a labor market it s the additional cost of one more worker Keep in mind again these are both people that are participating in that market So I m going to put This is the same thing except for it s the cost So you wrote it ready in your own words but make sure you ve got that basic idea Additional cost of one more unit So now we re applying it to this new idea What s the marginal social cost of something The marginal social cost Andrew How much society loses for one more unit Okay How much society loses for one more unit or how much it takes away or cost us when we make one more unit So we re going to think and I m going to add thoughts here It s for all of society So flip it over what are some examples or go to the other sheet What are some examples of negative externalities now that we ve got this down in your mind What are some negatives Zach Breathing in pollution Pollution That again he is on it this is the textbook definition Pollution is the most common example So what has government implemented to try to curtail pollution What kind of things have they done Smoking ban laws Okay good smoking bans So you could say pollution you could also say cigarette smoke is a negative externality So government stepped in which is the type of pollution The government stepped in and said No you cannot smoke in places of employment you cannot smoke in any public area in Illinois it s obviously done by state but the state has stepped in to curtail this type of externality Betty Don t they have pollution rights that they can buy in the market Okay Very good Who do they buy them from The government Good So federal government actually sells pollution rights So that s another way that they deal with it What agency was created to deal with pollution The EPA EPA So the EPA is out there trying to make sure that only so much pollution happens Yeah This is kind of more local but like banks in Elmhurst like they make a lot of banks a ton of banks but every single time they make a new one it seems like less use of all the banks like there s no point to them and it s like a lot of So you re saying that s a negative externality because there s too much Not just that there s just like Say you replace a store that maybe some people use and make a bank and then there s less to do in Elmhurst Okay Try to think of the best way I mean I see what you re saying because that transaction takes away from your enjoyment of living in a town You could put something else there like a new house or a restaurant or something just don t put a bank Okay So how would the government fix that They could be like We re not going to let you buy it The bank buy that lot they could have said no So they might limit they might say how many of these business could be That s a new one I ve never heard of that but obviously there s something there to that because you re saying it s taking away from the enjoyment of people in the community It is maybe adding to the wealth of the community with the employment and the income that s being raised but overall True no I think you ve got something there but it s a different lens Andrew I think that a better example for that would be parking lots because then it s just there and not doing anything whereas for a bank it increases the competition and it increases the rate of The parking garage closer to the Y encourages people to go down to the retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of does encourage people to All right I like what you guys are going with this either one of you could make an argument with it That kind of brings up another point though This is somewhat of Alex are you with me This is somewhat of a this is somewhat of an opinion right Because now you re saying that there s certain things that there s definite and those are going to be our perfect examples like pollution No one in their right mind can argue that pollution gives a benefit to society They can argue that what they produce that produces pollution is helping industrialize I mean talk to China One example Their massive pollution few regulations at all because they re trying to compete with other countries and step up but they re not they definitely would say it s worth it But pollution itself no one can say that it s good Andrew mentioned something about the beauty of something What are some things that people buy or do 
 All right So I showed you all that video for three reasons Number one I want you to see that volleyball is not a girl s sport Here in the South a lot of people think of volleyball as a girl sport because we don t have a lot of male high school volleyball teams I don t know why we just don t That s a common misconception that volleyball is a girl s sport Everybody in that video was a male Everybody in that video was over 50 years of age That means volleyball is a lifetime activity Raise your hand if you can take a guess at what a lifetime activity is Yes ma am A lifetime activity is something you can do when you re older A lifetime activity is something you can do basically for the rest of your life Would golf be a lifetime activity No Golf Yes Golf would be a lifetime activity There s people 70 80 90 years old that are playing golf As a matter of fact playing golf is an accomplishment to be able to go out and shoot your age So I m if I m 70 and I go out and shoot a good Golf is a lifetime activity How about bowling Yes How about tackle football No No Tackle football would not be a lifetime activity If I was to go to the YMCA do you think I would be able to find a league to sign up for tackle football at my age No No Can I go out to the YMCA and find a volleyball league for somebody my age Yeah Yes So volleyball is what we consider a lifetime activity Something you can do the rest of your life Okay the third thing those guys were pretty good Mmhmm And they were pretty athletic So by playing volleyball and staying active you re going to be more athletic than a lot of people that are your age So not only is volleyball a lifetime activity it s going to help you stay in shape help you stay active okay First thing we re going to do is the serve With the serve there are a few things we need to remember okay First thing I want us to remember with the serve is that the ball must stay at the waist When we hit it out of our hand we want it to stay at our waist If I hold the ball up here and I hit the ball is going to go up It s all about the angles okay If I hit the ball right here it s going to go up and out like I want it to go all right So then I want to hit it at my waist Second thing that we re going to remember is that my opposite foot needs to be forward If I hit it with my right hand I want my left leg to be up front like this What other activities have we done that your opposite foot is forward Yes Catching Throwing right With the overhand throw we step with our opposite foot What else Yes ma am The underhand toss The underhand toss that is exactly right I think Ms Beldo taught y all the underhand toss Step tick tock point Which foot do we step with The opposite The opposite foot Do you see a trend Can you make a little connection there Opposite foot forwards okay Now the next things that I want you to remember kind of go hand in hand They are tick tock Tick tock looks like this Tick Tock Pretty easy right Tick Tock Tick I want to pull it back Back here Tock our arm is coming forward Now we are going to add a little something to the tock part All the tock when we do tock I want you standing like this and do tock When we do tock we are actually going to transfer our weight from our back foot going forward into the front foot What do you think that s going to do If we transfer that weight forward Yes If we transfer our weight forward it s going to put more pressure It s going to put more pressure on the ball Am I plugging it harder or softer Harder Harder It s going to produce more force Right I m going to hit the ball harder if I do this than if I do this Does that make sense Because you re getting that momentum going forward It s just like in baseball If I m playing baseball and I m standing in the outfield am I going to throw it harder if I do this or if I do this The one with more force The second one right Because my momentum is going forward Does that make sense So my momentum is going forward Just like in four square If I m playing four square and I want to hit the ball and I m trying to get somebody out in four square am I going to hit it harder if I do this or if I do this That The second one I get my force from the momentum going forward That s right and the last thing I want you to remember with the serve is the follow through Follow the ball John will you stand up please If I want the ball to go to John my follow through should be towards John right If I want the ball going towards the flag my follow through The flag towards the flag If I want the ball going to the cougar my follow through The cougar going to the cougar But right now we re working on hitting it straight so my follow through goes to my target Watch see me take everything out Ball s at my waist my opposite foot is forward tick Tock Tock just like that Okay We ll do it a little bit farther Ready John Opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick tock All right Did you see everything that we had just talked about Opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick transfer my weight into tock All right You re kind of hitting it like that I hit it Good That s great Tony you ready Tony You ready Tossin it up and hittin it And stop just a second put the ball on the ground Ball on the ground A lot of people are doing a good job getting that opposite food forward but they re not transferring their weight to that foot they re getting that opposite foot forward and they re standing like this Am I going to generate much force by doing this No Think about baseball I could step with that opposite foot but if I step and then throw is that helping me generate any force No No I want to step into it Same way in baseball When I throw a baseball I want to step and throw at the same time to get my momentum going forward We re generating force So instead of Tony are you ready Instead of this opposite foot forward and like that I want to generate more force so I m going to start with my weight back here and go into it You see the difference Ball on the ground please Yes So work on generating that force going forward Okay Continue Go And stop just a second Ball on the ground All right One more way that we re going to try to generate force is by following through after we hit the ball So instead of Alex are you ready I m going to serve this to you Instead of doing this kind of almost like you re punching the ball and stopping I m going to follow through to my target If Alex is my target my arm should finish up here at my target Watch Do you see the difference in the force between punching it and following through to your target So that s another thing to work on Remember if you are doing a good job with the ball that you ve got you can switch to another ball If you ve got one of these big yellow ones and you re doing perfect every time I would recommend switching to either this or one of the yellow and blue ones Challenge yourself a little bit Let s go ahead and switch stations so that if you were here one person walk up here and get a clipboard and paper so you can leave notes for your partner If you were over there come over here If you weren t over here just put your clipboard on the steps there And everybody stop Put the ball on the ground just a second No balls in the air Everybody stand up Everybody stand up Alright put everything on the ground Everybody should have to free hands Together let s work on tick transfer your weight through to your target Ryan go in his place Tick arm back transfer weight follow through to your target I still see some people doing this Where s that ball going to go That way That way If I m aiming at the Ball on the ground If I m aiming at the white poster my follow through is to the white poster Everybody pick out a target Tick step follow through Go Pick out a target tick step follow through Go get that ball We ll get you another ball Who can raise their hand and tell me the first thing we need to remember for the volleyball serve Yes sir The first thing we talked about Yes ma am The ball should be at your Waist The ball s at your waist And what is that going to impact And what s it going to influence How far the ball goes It s going to influence how far the ball goes All right So if the ball is up here it s going to go where Up Up If I m down here the ball s going to go Go out so I want to add my weight in order to get that angle so the ball will go over the net and drop What s the second thing to remember Yes sir Remember it s what we talked about with the underhand throw four square and the overhand throw Our opposite foot is Forward Forward right Our opposite foot is forward Like this What s the third thing Shift your weight I want to shift my weight We actually did tick tock when I talk about shifting my weight but shifting our weight is one of the most important things because that is how we produce 
 Like compared to osteoblasts the osteoclasts to be more efficient and work harder than the osteoclasts therefore you re more than you are building so that ratio can cause brittle bones So what Okay right Yeah One s up one goes down Yeah if you re taking away more than you re putting back No I m sorry why don t osteo Cause there s a lack of estrogen and or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work We kind of hit on that a little I don t know I kinda did but I kinda didn t What causes osteoblasts to work That it Okay so when they re saying that the osteoclasts are working more what they re not saying more than they used to work they re saying more compared to the osteoblasts okay It s not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity They re just doing what they do It s just because the blast activity dropped which you guys got that the blast activity dropped Why did that blast activity drop Because there weren t enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting Good Is everybody get that Cause see now the blast activity s what s really dropping And the clast activity keeps going like it normally goes but relative to one another you have more clast activity less blast activity and therefore you re losing bone Everybody got that idea Okay good you did a good job reasoning that out Okay you can keep going Matt Okay our next question kind of gets off of like the description of osteoblasts and it says How can osteoblasts or how can osteoporosis be prevented Brooke Well they recommend having like a good number a good amount of calcium intake a day about 1 000 1 500 milligrams you could do that something simple like that could prevent like osteoporosis in the long run All right I would also suggest regular exercise in order to kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise so that there s less there s more bone actually broken down Basically a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk Along with everything else there s a I went to the Food and Drug Administration you can have Zoledronic acid which can be injected every two years for like prevention along with the diet and exercise Anybody else have anything they d like to add I was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other Nobody else Okay Now who s on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed Yeah I found the most current one is a form called Dual Energy X ray Reabsorption Test to test the bone density you get a score of either one or below means you re normal one to 2 5 is osteoporosis 2 5 and above it s just your bones are gonna break any time All right Anybody else There s just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density so there s like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative that s what they use cause it s like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not so you kinda need more ways to test Good You can also take a sample of your and analyze it to see if there s any signs of erosion or anything that ll lead to osteoporosis Okay what s that called Anybody know what that s called What is it Bioscan Good Before you even go to the doctor like it s really hard to diag like there s not really symptoms of it But some of the symptoms are like bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that and breaking bones with little or no trauma What do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma What kind of fracture Traumatic Traumatic would be if it was kind of trauma Pathological good job yeah Pathological fracture that would be a pathological fracture if there s a disease under there like osteoporosis which has made it weak enough to break Good call So somebody mentioned the scanner Zach right You talked about that The abbreviated what did what was the full name of that scan again Dual Energy X ray Absorption Okay has anyone ever heard of a DEX scan DEXA scanner that s where the D E X comes from Dual Energy X ray DEXA scan and that s very common yeah Is that like what the guy from Pursuit of Happiness Yeah I don t know if you ever saw that movie I didn t Yeah the bone density scanner I didn t know if that was it Yeah okay so how did they what the general how they actually what bones do they look at in the scanner I think it was the wrist the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis The lumbar part of your spine because that s the first to go Why What else is important to consider if you if you think about the type of bone being affected what type of bone being affected What type of bone I should remember Trabeculae Yeah so that s a spongy bone right So trabeculae of the spongy bone why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now It s a spongy bone Yeah it s an irregular shaped bone but the body of the vertebrae is basically a cortex in and it s a spongy bone in there it s all trabeculae What was the other bones that you said Madhura Wrist and hip Okay so hip as in what do you mean by that do you think Robert Ilium Ilium It s all a spongy bone A spongy bone in the ilium good place to look for it But here s the thing what about the wrist How come think from a practical scenario how come the wrist Yeah Lexi I think it s cause you use it like so often that they is probably the most common because you use your wrist for like basically Do you use it a lot Another possible reason Yeah Kevin Because it s a lot of like small bones so they may be easier to break or like be more fragile Okay that s a possibility Mikey I would say cause it s easy to get to like it s pretty hard to take like and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip It s kinda hard to get like a good angle but like your wrist can there s not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture Okay thank you for that That s exactly why they use the wrist I mean the wrist bones when you think about em you know they re not weight bearing so they re probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones but they do have spongy bone in them they re little irregular shaped bones which have a cortex with some spongy bone So there is some material in there to evaluate but you don t have to disrobe you don t have to do anything you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what s called a screening a screening test Has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before Or thought of ever heard of screening tests being done for other things No Not familiar with the screening tests I think I ve had one Have you Yeah because if I had like it wasn t for bones though It could be for anything Like they were looking for appendicitis but they couldn t find it so they were doing other all these other kinds of tests I don t know if that Well a screening test it could be it could be a screening test Screening tests are basically more generalized testing not the most specific but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation okay So if you put your arm in the scanner and it was towards the low end it s not the best for making an end all you know quantitative diagnosis But it s a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium you see So that s why the arm So it s interesting that you brought that up that was really good cause it really helps us look at the whole Where is this occurring and Why do they use those specific bones Okay Matt anything else there Our next question we have already said how it s diagnosed we know what it is So how can we treat osteoporosis Well I said I found online that there were really no treatments like true treatments for osteoporosis It s more of trying to prevent it by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before because you can t really treat it once it s gone Well that s funny I found something a little different there s a few medicines right now like talking about you ve seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it Now they re actually saying like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you ve lost from the bones But it s also something kind of funny I saw if the bones start to become more dense they also found that like around your jaw starts to deteriorate faster some reason actually get like sore throat So I was wondering if anyone try to reason that out Because I could not figure out why just your jaw starts losing calcium but your long bones start gaining it Are you saying that they re taking medication and then they re experiencing pain So that Yeah like the calcium to deteriorate But like your long bones it s like your limbs and everything start to become more dense Is your jaw a lot of is it one of those bones Yeah some but there isn t a whole lot in there there is some Is it a more compact bone Probably a more compact bone in your jaw there isn t a lot of cavity space or spongy bone space there Maybe that has something to do with that Even having a sore throat I don t know why that would affect it at all Maybe because it s a horrible medicine I don t know like the thyroid gland like this one or the parathyroid this is like calcium like bone absorption so maybe I don t know it s not working as efficiently so it s not getting the through to the jawbone Or maybe it s working too much or something Maybe since your jaw is losing calcium and it s kinda gaining like losing its calcium so it s probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis Your hyoid bone isn t your hyoid bone isn t it Sort of high It doesn t really touch any other bones but it s kinda in there So it s kinda in your throat so that could be like I don t know it s kinda unusual Just answer this one with the general area cause there s a lot of instances where you couldn t sit or lay down for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus So I don t know there were a lot of really bad side effects just Well what I was wondering I kinda see like some doctors like just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention would be the other side to treatment just go do like those lifestyle changes Instead of like thinking Oh I ll wait until these signs come up and have platelet scans and I ll take medicine Just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don t drink excessively and like have those good workout regimens so you prevent it rather than treat it Yeah seems like a disease that s either prevented or managed not so much treated but I thought I think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids for like asthma like in your inhaler So it s something that inhibits bone breakdown so it doesn t sound like it treats it but it kind of manages it so you don t break bones Yeah did anyone request a name a name brand Fosamax Did we see that Yeah Did they tell you how it worked No actually No well Fosamax is like did you see something there Zach Yeah wasn t that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo osteo something bone reabsorption So they re inhibiting which cells Osteoclasts Okay yeah so that s how Fosamax and those work They inhibit the osteoclasts so they re not building bone though You see the difference Yeah They re not really building the bone they re stopping the erosion it s a little different But if you have like dead bone or old bone that needs to be replaced wouldn t that just inhibit it just as much because there s still old calcium sitting in your leg that I don t know whenever there s waste in your body that doesn t get dealt with I mean like when you have an appendectomy and there s waste in your appendix that like it can kill you if there s like waste in your body So maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis not so much as help it in the long run I m thinking cause any time you re keeping like something that s old in your body that s not good Like you eat something you have to like you have to digest it and I don t know Yeah it s a good thought process Good thought process So that s what Fosamax works that way So if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps let s say someone who has osteoporosis let s assume they have it now What types of mechanisms in other words what types of things will we try and get a drug to do What would we want it to do You want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better And someone already mentioned this but they had like estrogen supplements like supposedly like help out with that Maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability Okay well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement Did anyone request that as a therapy Yeah Kevin And there s like these like it s like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches where you can take it as a pill So it adds estrogen to your body so it balances out your loss of estrogen and raises it Yeah there s like he was talking about the hormone replacement but I also read on Google Health that it s rarely used and it s not used twice with women I don t know if that has anything to do with it I can Google it I guess like if you use the treatment once Any ideas why Anybody find out why estrogen replacement they used to you know what They used to give estrogen like they give vitamins it used to be prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen Seriously and it wasn t all that long ago how come it isn t get Because then your body stops producing its like natural estrogen so Good idea maybe Any other poss Nick any idea you can think of I don t know you re not producing enough So because you re not we should get more well how come have anybody heard of anything that s related to estrogen therapy bad things Facial hair growth Well testosterone can increase facial hair growth someone else over here Cancer Cancer and that s the problem they saw incidences of particularly breast cancer went up substantially and so that s why Artie they re saying that you know hormone replacement it s still being used It s rarely used Yeah but not like it used to be not like it used to be So if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly or blasts to work properly then shouldn t you like have like some sort of treatment to like make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts We would have like sort of a difference in their relationship Good idea But isn t that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone So shouldn t we find a way to like make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone Because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they re stimulated But they have to be stimulated so show me if you re looking for a way to stimulate them more than make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes No that would be more like a genetic thing cause your osteocytes your DNA is like breaking down as you get older So it s like not it s like I don t know is it mutating When it gets older I don t know a lot about genetics but I know your DNA kinda breaks down as you get older and so that makes your cells not as efficient So it might be more of a DNA kinda thing Where you have to engineer that DNA wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you re like 78 as when you re 12 So it might be in like that area but I don t know a lot about that so Yeah it s interesting where you can go with it All right You can take this because even Artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat What were you saying about that I don t know maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland I don t know maybe it like produced too much I don t know the jaw bone and it reached the jawbone first and I thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to the rest of the body So which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines Maybe that s why your jaw s if you release a lot of that hormone then it s building your jaw up and when you re building bone you get growing pains Maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw Maybe 
 Okay Now when we sang that music scale we were We were actually stepping up We were going from low to high And if you ll look over at this you can tell these were the notes that we were singing from low to high The first note was a line note Let s speak it together Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Good job Those notes were stepping And if you ll notice here I ve got carpet squares and I have them with line note and space note Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Good job That s what we sang when we sang our scale and that s the notes that you re seeing up there are those line notes and those space notes All right I d like for us Will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it Sit behind the carpet square of your choice And let s go ahead and sit up tall on our knees Sit nice and tall on your knees And the next person come in and find a carpet square sit behind it behind that hand chimes And I don t think we ll need We ll need one more person The next person What about me Five Good job All right Now everyone even if you re sitting in your chairs you need to practice with me because we re all going to be playing the hand chimes today Do not touch your hand chime just yet Let s all just practice Start off with your hand up Put your hand chime down a second We re going to just practice with our arm only And it s going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that s going to make a difference in the way that it sounds All right watching me Hold and again Hold Hold Asanti Hold Hold Okay stop Now people down here pick up your hand chime and let s see if we can get that technique going Get ready One more time Good Now let s Just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop Good Now when I point to each person by yourself you will play the music scale So do not play until I point to you Looking at me we begin Start with the low C Good job Let s do it again That s the scale And these notes are stepping because it s line note space note line note space note Any time you ve got two notes beside of each other that s a stepping melody One more time starting with the lowest C Good job Now put your hand chime down a second We just heard a stepping melody Any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other two neighbors playing that s a stepping melody I want you to stand up please and I d like for you to stand up Take your hand chime hold it and That melody Someone raise your hand and tell me What did it do Logan Skipping Actually It leaped You re exactly right It leaped Because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play That s a leaping melody Good job London do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping I mean leaping and skipping Can somebody help us What s the difference between a leap and a skip If you leap it s more than a skip All right The leaping is more than the skipping Skipping All right You sit down Put the hand chime down And you stand up You keep remaining standing Take your hand chime and you play That was a skip You are exactly right That s a skip when you just skip over one place one person All right Have a seat You have a seat And I d like for Ashley you stand up And what I want her to do is for four times I d like you to play your hand chime watching me I m going to let her try Someone raise your hand What was that James what was that Repeating You re exactly right That was a repeating note The one person that one pitch played four times All right Sit down please Now will you please stand You stand and you stand Watching me All right Raise your hand please Tell me what was that Devon Stepping A stepping pattern And it went from high to low You re exactly right Have a seat Now last week I gave you a piece of paper and it was something that I wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping stepping and repeating on the music scale If you ll look over at the Smartboard there is some notes there on Number 1 some notes on Number 1 And you were last week going to circle an S if it was a stepping pattern You were going to circle an R if it was a repeating pattern Raise your hand if you know what those notes on Number 1 were doing Christian put your hand chime down and you can come up and circle whether those notes in the Number 1 if they were stepping or if they were repeating You re exactly right Christian How did you know that It was staying on the same note Staying on the same note very good And thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes Number 2 Akrista can you walk around that other way and come right here And why don t you show us Put the hand chime down please Show us what the notes in Number 2 are doing Let s see if it s doing a space note and then a what Line note Line note and then a space note And she is exactly right Those notes were stepping what Down Down And Number 3 Thank you ma am Come this way right around here And she s looking at those music notes and she s going to be able to tell They re right here Number 3 All right Let s say it with her Line note Space note Line note space note Line note Right here Are they staying all the same No They staying all the same What are those notes doing They re stepping You re exactly right They re stepping up Thank you ma am And tiptoe back to your seat Very good job Now I would like for the last two people B and C If you ll tiptoe to your seat I m going to call you back up here in a few minutes The rest of the folks you ve got to be sitting up nice and tall sit up tall on your knees Let s see if they can play a very familiar tune I want you looking at the very first note the The very first note Keiani You have that low C And what do you notice about C C Keiani what s your note going to be doing What s the word when you have the same pitch Re peating Thank you He has a repeating note And G Christian what are you going to be doing Repeating Repeating Adam what are you going to be doing Repeating Repeating So we have a lot of repeating notes in this song Sit up tall on your knees Sit up tall Pick your hand chime up We re going to see if we can play this familiar tune Waiting One two ready sound Very good That was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star It was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star You recognized it All right Put your hand chime down a second I was listening You heard the melody All right Now let me see Sitting tall I m going to get someone that s sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit I think I would like for Christopher Will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody Oh don t raise your hand We ll let Christian choose Three people that would be able to play Christopher Oh yeah Christopher Or you can call him Chris That s Christian All right Tell me which three people Just point to them All right He s pointing to you Stand up with your hand chime We re talking about stepping now Stepping All right Okay Chris has pointed to these three tapped them on the shoulder Let s see If you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern will you just gives a thumbs up silently You re exactly right he did pick He did it He did pick three All right Put your hand chime down and sit down I d like to call on Harmony Will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody Leaping So you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder Leaping Leaping Leaping Okay Now these two people are side by side There s a line note and a space note and they re neighbors Someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play What would they be playing if they re neighbors That would be a stepping And I wanted a leap like a frog leaps over a whole lot So come and see if you can fix it Real quick Somebody needs to sit down Who do you want to sit down All right Sit down And pick somebody that will be a leaping melody Like a frog leaping leaps over a whole lot All right He stands Take your hand chime Play Now she leaped over a space note and a line note Give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly Yes that is a leaping melody Good All right Sit down Hand chimes still on the floor I d like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair What we did in that song we had several times that there was repeating notes We had a few times where we had some stepping side by side And we had some leaping melodies When we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies the melody If you re playing a xylophone though you could do it right by yourself I can I would like Keiani will you step around behind here And Sheridan you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose And Dev Devuan Devuan walk around here Walk this way And he s going to be the teacher I want you to choose Sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do Choose something that you want them to play and let them see it Turn it so that they can see it All right What do you want them to play Step Play a stepping melody All right Good and stop Now someone Both of them did do a stepping melody But he was playing right here Can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better A hit in the middle He says Hit it in the middle Hit where the music notes are those steps Let s try it again Play em soft Great job That is stepping All right Choose another one Oh now he wants a leap Good job What do you want Devon Devuan Devuan Repeat Good job All right thank you Put your mallet right there on the instrument Lay it on the top That will be quicker for today And tiptoe back to your seat walking around the instruments I d like for Wes H to step around and find yourself a xylophone Step around over here Akrista Sit down tall on your knees And what do you want them to play Tell them She wants you to play a repeating note Now those were both kind of high repeating notes very high Do you think you could play a low one Good job Now how did you know that was going to be low Akrista Cause the little ones are higher Bigger ones are low You are exactly right What else do you want them to do She d like a what 
 Who came up with the definition for radiation Peter you had a good definition could you repeat that remind us I don t remember it exactly but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move waves that are radiated I mean Didn t you say it was waves that are spread Yeah waves that are spread by something and they usually have energy with them Like the sun sends its radiation to the earth in the form of light heat UVA UVB rays Okay so with that understanding would you guys say that all radiation is harmful Not all Yes To a degree all of radiation is harmful But just it depends on how harmful But so then what is like when it s not harmful It s very very very Not almost It s almost negligible What types of waves that radiate or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful Radio waves Any others Jordan Microwaves Visible light Yeah visible light isn t really that harmful What about microwaves that s a good one What do you guys think about microwaves I thought they were dangerous but somebody told me that they weren t They re not really that harmful are they I mean You probably shouldn t stand in front of it Saying they re not that harmful They re not I mean I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad but I think that could be the same with a lot of things The door shuts when you use the microwave too What about then where do they fall on the spectrum what makes you think they re not dangerous Or that they are Because they are longer than light waves They ve got longer wavelengths Which what does that mean They have lower frequencies They don t carry as much energy with them Lower frequencies Let me consult my chart Okay good idea Or can anyone help her What was your question Claire Oh I didn t have a question Oh okay What was the question Why is she looking at her chart Nope same We think they re not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light Light is Okay good so I think this is a good segue to the next question which is why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans while others aren t Do you know what a segue is Okay Which ones have more energy than others Gamma rays and X rays and UVH rays Okay good Peter did you have something you wanted to add To what he just said Mm hmm Okay good and can you repeat that Sam Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy Okay good So ultimately what is that energy doing Why is that harmful to us Can stimulate cell growth The more energy it has the more like materials it can penetrate Like visible light wouldn t really cut through you but gamma rays could like travel through skin And X rays can What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology Cancer Well that it s when cells grow too fast the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and There s a mistake in the coding of the DNA and then everything just goes haywire and the cells like what Caleb said grow at abnormally fast rates and they just take over that area and spread Well yeah they stop functioning as normal cells and their sole function is to reproduce and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells Okay so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy This dangerous energy Well wouldn t like Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and or is that not Why do they stimulate growth Because they have energy What does the energy do to stimulate it What were you going to say Ronnie Well I just said that they trigger they don t like stimulate I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary But they can trigger something dangerous like with I don t really have like the percent or anything but What else might control cell growth DNA Okay good yeah Lots of energy can Can energy alter DNA I feel like it can t Well isn t that what it s doing if it s triggering abnormal cell growth I don t know Is anyone in here have you taken or are you taking biology I took it last year I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer It s okay and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion that it does lie in the DNA and that you know certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle So when we think about cancer a lot of times in light or electromagnetic waves a lot of times we think about skin cancer And we talked a bit about that yesterday We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world So how does skin color variation how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives You mean based on their race Just based on their geologic background Geographic background not geologic Well I mean people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really really pale skin I don t think that s true I think it s just that it doesn t show up as much like you can definitely still get sun damage No of course you can still get sunburned but I don t think it s like It s harder I think so I think it s just less noticeable Yeah I think it s just less noticeable I really don t think it has anything to do with Okay so you re getting the same amount good you re getting the same amount of radiation sure Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb our skin absorbs It s actually it s in their Grace and Lana s video About how What did we do On your presentation about sunburn How sunburn works I don t remember Okay so ultimately I guess I ll restate the question So how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive We see a lot of variation so a lot of people often times say Oh why do people in in countries that are near the equator Why are they darker wouldn t that make them hotter Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light Is that true is that what s happening It seems kind of Wouldn t that make you sweat more then Which would be good if it was hot I guess sweat Sweat is just to release the heat on your body No but that s what I m saying like if you get hotter quicker then you would start sweating earlier which cools you down What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations Melanin Okay good alright So people who have darker skin do they have more or less They have more It s in eyes too right It s what causes eye color differences Maybe I m making that up but What do you think the purpose of the melanin is Is it to absorb Grace offered one theory what s another theory too there There are several different reasons What does it do to UV light What s different about people that live say in the equator regions like the and people who live up north They don t get sunburned if they live there I mean There s like nothing to Yeah exactly People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned because they re not exposed to that much sun or their relatives weren t And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin But I don t know why Do you know Miss Roseborough Yeah I have an understanding yes And when I think about it I kind of think about the actual pigment itself and what it s doing and where it s located on the body What it may be serving to do Doesn t it synthesize vitamin D for us That would make sense Yeah that s vitamin D from sunlight I guess that s why Okay so people who have more melanin have live in the sun you know they have more exposure to the sun Why do they need that extra melanin To protect them Okay yeah so let s go with that to protect them From what From the radiation like I guess if you re out in the sun more you need more protection so like it s kind of like a built in sunblock What would it protect So it s on the surface right Protects the inner skin It protects the outer layer right Epidermis Yeah I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking Is that why they you have lighter on your hands Oh I think that s the thing about like gamma rays for example being more like that was one of the question because they have more ability to penetrate through skin and Okay so really what s happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin How does it do that It just doesn t the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat and so You get the heat but not the radiation Right exactly so it doesn t go further into your body So darker people get less sunburned than fairer people because of that Well does it necessarily have to do with sunburn And they re less likely to get skin cancer Yeah I d say they re less likely to get skin cancer When you get tan are you getting more melanin in your skin Yeah what s happening when you get tan So shouldn t tanning make your skin stronger Well If it increases melanin I don t think it s necessarily increasing it Because the tan goes away Oh So it s like you have whatever your natural skin color is then that is determined how much Okay Okay so next misconception that a lot of people have or just something that I ve always wondered about I don t know if it s a misconception or not but I m thinking about colors that we associate with certain just everyday things So when I go into the bathroom when I go into the kitchen I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water and blue for cold water Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true Because fire is red Water and ice is blue It s not really blue it s more clear White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames Yeah explain that I don t know I guess back a long time ago before they knew that The hottest part of the fire is at the top and if you think about a flame usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom and then it s the red orange at the top Which is where it would be the hottest It s hottest at the top But there s at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from At the peak it s the hottest But then the bunsen burner the hottest part is like Yeah the hottest part of the flame is the top You get a marshmallow you put it at the bottom No sir What color is at the top guys Red White Or orange Blue and white at the bottom It s an experiment Miss Rose let s do experiments on fire That s a good idea I think we should at this point Do you have bunsen burners in here No I don t have a gas source So let s just go back I even broke it down and I was thinking about well where did this come from I was thinking what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red and what are being reflected by the color red And so is the color red actually hotter How could I relate that to temperature How do you even relate a color to temperature So just the color red what s it reflecting What s it absorbing What color does it reflect It reflects red And it absorbs green and blue Or cyan Right so going back to the what makes it that color its natural frequency what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature What s happening as a result of different white light say striking it and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light Would red or blue actually be hotter As a pigment Blue should be hotter because it has more energy it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency Yeah Sam s right So with a pigment Think about a pigment first What about it just think about it Yeah so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed and certain wavelengths of light are being reflected What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light What happens to the energy that is being absorbed It transfers to the medium Okay good I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths so Probably right Okay good so it absorbs so let s think about blue again How could you apply that What wavelengths of light does it absorb Shorter wavelengths than red Well no blue absorbs red and green so this would be longer wavelengths and lower frequencies So red would absorb the blue Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency had more energy which means it would be hotter right What do you guys think Can you restate that Sorry because red absorbs blue and blue has a higher frequency the red would be absorbing the higher frequency which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency So red would be the hottest The man has a point I agree with Peter I agree with it too I agree with Peter Yeah that s sort of the conclusion I came to the only conclusion Then I started thinking more I was like well how does this apply to stars So if I see a star that gives off a 
 Consider what you read about organic lettuce and Rosie from Omnivore s Dilemma and from what you re reading do you feel it s worth the extra cost and effort to eat organic Yes So for some organics I believe it is worth it and others I don t Industrial organic I don t believe it s worth it because for the lettuce in the book Omnivore s Dilemma they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce and I don t believe that s energy efficient at all But other farms other industries or other organic farms like Polyface Farms they use all natural energy not a lot of fossil fuels go into it and I think it s more efficient So organic like that I believe is better but industrial organic I don t believe is better That s a good point I was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic Phil if you want to pick someone Eli So normal organic food like what started the idea of organic food was completely different from organic food that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays Like what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local sustainable farm like Polyface Farms where it s completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals But industrial organic systems it s pretty much the same as normal industrial food system except they don t use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food They still have animal rights There s still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories and stuff like that Araceli I agree with Eli because when I read organic I thought organic was good But then basically it was the same thing Like the chickens they still got fed corn but they had an open door but they were so fat they couldn t go through Like why pay the extra money for something that s going to be exactly the same as the other thing I think it is worth buying organic food Because even though the animals are treated the same and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel we save a lot of farmland from being put like pesticide and everything on it so we could have chemical free land And also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use So it might cost a little bit more but it s worth it Matt In response to I guess Eli it s not exactly the same there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones But yes I can definitely agree that it s a very similar thing it doesn t solve all the problems with the industrial system I don t agree with what was just said that when you farm without pesticides it s better because in Omnivore s Dilemma even though they farm without pesticides they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land So it s not necessarily better it just sounds better I just like Simone s point because I think that a lot of the problems are still there and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides I think it s still important to eat real organic food I think that would be the best Industrial organic is a step in the right direction but I don t think it s close enough to where we should be with our food system I agree with Molly that industrial organic foods on the face are both They re worth paying for because they re the food that we should be eating but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution If you want the right type of food you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the United States but still has healthy animals And animals that have evolved to eat only being fed that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the United States like we are fed now I was going to also ask a couple personal questions since I was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change do you think now that you feel like you re more aware or She says that she always bought grass fed beef and I try to eat healthy but in the case of fast food of course I go and eat fast food But lately I ve been badgering her and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak I ve been waiting for that for a long time The corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad so Anyway There s nobody asking I don t think organic s really necessarily healthy for us because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need what essentials we still need Like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed So how can we tell organic s good for us if we don t know what organic is different from what we get from normal food I thought Curt brought a good point up too which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers but it is a great point that Curt and Greg brings up which is that that way can t feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food I completely agree with that It s implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy We read in the Omnivore s Dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day that s a lot of land for very little meat and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country Lisa So I kind of agree with what you re saying but it doesn t have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic If there s little farms all over the United States then meat can go to those people around there It might not happen all of a sudden but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better Whether it s more expensive or not it s healthier for us knowing that the animals When the animals are not fed on natural stuff that in turn is bad for us Ashley I agree with what everyone said and that the point that Paulina brought up about we re still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what s good for us Because I feel like it s more better to spend even just a few more cents if organic food isn t that expensive and go to certain places A few more cents on the local home grown organic food because I used to buy meat from the What s it called The meat section The deli Deli yeah there you go And I used to buy meat there and I thought it was all fine you know whatever until I went to the doctor one day because I was getting really injured and she was like You re missing all these vitamins and she gave me all these vitamins to take And I didn t know that that was missing inside my food and then I go to the organic section of the supermarket and it s not even like vitamins that were missing in the meat it s vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food For example like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there just because it s like naturally grown and organic So I was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health So I feel like if people realize how important it is for your health that scare will wake them up and they ll be able to spend the dollar Okay well I agree I think that it s worth the extra cost for organic because like in the book it said when we buy organic food we re voting with our forks and we re voting for the type of food we want And if we go organic then the producers will think that most of us want organic so they ll start growing more and selling more organic food so that it might become cheaper in the long run I personally don t really care Like if it s cheaper that s cool because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off And animal s rights are nice but they re going to be killed anyway It s like they re all going to die anyway They re going to die so Michael I like it And yeah I mean even though organic s good we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income So we might not be like the healthiest nation but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the United States So I kind of like that They don t have to worry about paying high prices for food even though it s bad for my health And even if it is bad I could just exercise So I think it s a personal responsibility to watch what you eat So we should be open to that Even with the industrialized food system we re still not feeding everyone If you go to like the Appalachians and stuff like that you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don t make enough money to buy even the cheap food So I think that it s not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go I think we need to worry about cost later on and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to Lisa I see how you brought up the Appalchians but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here where it effects us or would you find it more important to focus like worldwide Like you could focus on problems that people have outside but like wouldn t you focus on start here make sure that we have what we need first and then branch out I think that with that like with a lot of people who get stuff locally So if you re saying locally like are you talking like Chicago Don t you think it s better to start locally and then Like we get better locally and then we get better statewide and then we ll go on until everybody has enough money to do this or their food everyone can buy their food I think so but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in Illinois that doesn t guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies And I think if we focus on doing something for United States and worry less about the other countries even though politically it might not be the right thing to do worry less about the other countries at this time But I think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing okay how can we make this better on a local level Chris I think that we can t really make it perfect like the way Polyface Farms is because of how the cities are laid out Because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there So I think what we have to do is have this industrial organic which still is I mean a lot more worth it because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil and I read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of New Jersey was like a dead zone at the end of the Mississippi River and the Gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down And that s problem that we should focus on Well I agree with Teresa that we should start only in the US because we can t just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are We only know that the US is eating unhealthy because according to Omnivore s Dilemma King Corn and Food Incorporated the problems are only occurring in the United States So if we want to solve this problem we should start from the origins because we started using corn massively creating problems and stuff not because of other countries Well maybe because we imported corn from Mexico and they dominated out other corn types so we started using corn But we should start focusing on more of what s the problem over here instead of other countries because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems maybe Yeah I was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic because even if it s just a little bit of farms here and there people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food Like in Polyface Farms people came from hundreds of miles I think or 100 miles just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food And with Jerry I wanted to say that Well nevermind Okay then So I remember Gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in America and that s the issue we should be working on But that s really what the food industry does like making the most food possible They pretty much put everything else aside besides mass production They don t really care about animal rights or worker safety or anything like that They just put as much work as they can into making more food and like Gabby said people in America still can t afford this food that s cheaper than it s ever been in the past So it just shows that really we can not go back to just normal farms because there s no way just natural farms like Polyface could ever sustain a population as big as America Like we kind of dug ourselves into a hole Yeah Okay so what do you think we should do then If we ve dug ourselves If we ve dug ourselves into this hole even though if we re going to be producing less food that s better quality I agree that is better because then you re taking the animal rights into consideration the workers rights and everything But then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat and so people are eating a bigger variety of food or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone Because at the end of the day either we re going to have a lot of people who die because we change this and we change it too fast and we re not ready to adapt to it or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives Eli Okay well I think that we should really just follow the model of like France or some other country in Europe or something Because they have a way better People in France are so much healthier than people in America and they don t eat nearly as much food They still aren t starving most people in France aren t starving or anything So there are countries it s just not left them Okay I don t know if this makes sense but if they have like 20 000 chickens in one pen do they have to feed them corn Like what s wrong with mass production but making it a little healthier Why can t they just give them something else that s maybe not all corn maybe half corn or half corn to little corn And then metaphorically speaking this totally reminds me of Hitler and like how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything and that s like what they re doing with the animals They re just working them to death and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever Deja I think the answer to your question is that most people just want money so they ll buy whatever s cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money I think that s the answer to your question about why don t they just choose another food instead of corn I think it s because of money But also consider what about What about the industrial organic Doesn t that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed Even though they re raised in coops They re still fed corn Molly Okay so I think that it s a really good idea that Matthew brought up a while ago that the industrial issue it can t really be solved by using beyond organic I think we ve moved on from that We can t really go back to beyond organic because we wouldn t be able to feed enough people And then just to Adam s point I don t think that we re not producing enough food I think the problem is that the people don t have enough money for the food So I think that producing more food wouldn t really help I was going to say everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody But if you think we actually waste a lot of food too That s actually important I think we saw a picture or something all of it gets thrown out every day or they have ads on it on TV If we re so worried about feeding everyone why don t we eat better ourselves and stop buying so much food we don t actually eat Well either whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside I like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea Whether it s taking France s ideas and taking it onto ourselves or just ourselves spreading it out Because so obnoxious they would go out to McDonald s my family and be like Do you know what that eats And then just start talking We re like Shut up don t tell me what it eats I m going to eat it And now my mom asks me she s like Is this good And then I read it I m like Yeah it has this and this and this And now she turns to me and like asks me should we buy this should we not So I think I have changed a little bit at least having been 
 Our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column what I learned in the KWL chart Okay So that s our goal Our goal is to find the answers to draw a conclusion to our month long experiment Before we do that why don t we take another measurement I would like you to measure your plant if you have any And I would like you to count the number of leaves on your plant on one of them Go ahead Scientists take your ruler Take your ruler and measure I like the way some of you are holding your rulers It s great that you put the lower number down when you measure Great If it helps you can pick up your plant Okay After you have your measurement and the number of leaves make sure you count the numbers the leaves too you may put your plant down After you put your plant down I know you are ready to continue Could you touch your head with your empty hands Good job John Touch your head with your empty hands Wonderful I see that you re ready right Katie Put your hands down I also took pictures of your experiment Your pictures will serve as data That means the information you collected This group picture were from the people who conducted the experiment to see if seeds would grow with soil water and sunlight Sunlight We have air all around us so we all have air I would like you to use good listening ears Day one Day 11 That s what it looked like Day 18 day 24 and day 32 We even have a ruler here a primary ruler that s easy for kindergartners to use Now looking at the data and your pictures What do you think the conclusion is if you did this experiment If you planted the seeds you planted your seeds with soil water and sunlight could you please raise your hand Good we have some eager participants Could you please come up here with your experiment and a ruler and explain to us My experiment was if plants will grow with sun soil and water and I put them near the windowsill Why did you put your cup near the windowsill To get some sunlight So your seeds received sunlight Did you water your seeds Yes I did Okay And you did put soil Yes in the cup Okay What do you think your conclusion is If plants will grow in sun soil and water And what is your answer Um Did your seeds grow Yes Did you take a measurement Yeah May we see how tall they are How tall are they One inch Did you see how Kieran measured his plants He has the end with the lower number touching the base of the plant That s good scientist Now how many leaves do you have on some of them Four leaves And how many did you have last week Two Two So what do you think is happening They re growing They re growing because you have more Leaves Wonderful Great job scientist And now let s look at the next experiment boys and girls This one is planting seeds without water Did seeds or plants grow without water I would like you to look at the data This is your data just in case you don t remember Sometimes we don t remember what we did but pictures help us Day one day 11 day 18 day 24 day 32 Hmmm I wonder what the conclusion is Oh John you want to come up and share Great Take your experiment and your ruler And I really love the way Thalia listened My experiment was if plants will grow without water And I put sun soil I gave it sun and I put soil and I never gave it water How did you give it sunlight I put it by the windowsill Okay so what is your conclusion My conclusion is plants will grow without water Will grow or won t grow Won t grow Very good Thank you Thank you very much young scientist Great job And let s look at the next experiment Did seeds grow without soil Here s day one Again scientists look at the smart board Day 11 day 18 and day 32 Now who did this experiment We would like you come on up Rachel Bring up your experiment and tell us all about it I did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil And I put seeds water in it and I put it by the window And I gave it sun And they didn t grow What did you not use Soil You did not use soil And where are your seeds By the window They re in your cup right now In my cup Uh huh Would you mind showing the class what you have there Tilt it down Boys and girls take a peek This is what Rachel s seeds I can t see Okay So now what is your conclusion Rachel Seeds won t grow without soil Very good Thank you scientist We have nothing to measure in Rachel s cup And the last one Oh boys and girls this is a very interesting one I really would like you to look up here Look at the data first Did seeds or plants grow without sunlight A lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight But look at this one Day one Do you have anything No No Day 11 No Day 18 look at the number Look at the numbers on the ruler Day 24 I want you to look at your data And day 32 Well that s some interesting experiment I know some of you did this one Quite a number of children If you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly Juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like Come on up Okay John you re going to show Juliana what a good listener you are okay Go ahead buddy I planted seeds without sun And I put them in the closet Did you cover your seeds with soil Yes So your seeds have soil Soil You watered them Watered them Every week you watered them And And no sun And you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in The closet In the closet and the closet has no Sun Has no sunlight It has no windows Right John Now Juliana tell the class if you ever had any sprouts I did have sprouts And what do you think happened They died How tall were your sprouts at one point One inch One inch and why do you think they died Because they had no sun And do you think the sun is important for plants to grow So what is your conclusion No seeds won t grow without sun Very good Good job scientist You may go back Now boys and girls I m going to ask you to think about your experiment Think about what your question was What you wanted to find out And the steps you took to do your experiment And you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out You may say What was your question Or What do you want to find out And here s a big question mark And after your partner answers then you may ask What did you do What steps did you take And at the end we will like you to ask your partner What is your answer How did you know that s the answer They have to tell you their evidence what they used to tell you the answer Okay now turn to your partner and talk to each other Remember how we work as partners What did you find out What was your question My question was Take turns Gabby take turns Boys and girls let s take 30 more seconds If you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free Okay boys and girls turn around Please put your hands on your lap so I can see your empty hands Alright Let s look at the answers again Our whole experiment and let s look at the questions Will seeds grow without water What do you think No If you don t think seeds will grow without water shake your head Great Cameron will seeds grow without water No No good Okay next question Will seeds grow without sunlight No Let me see you touch your ears if you don t think seeds will grow without sunlight Okay let s see Will they Cameron No Touch your ears so I know you understand Next one will seeds grow without soil Yes or no Yes No Will seeds grow without soil NO No Touch the ground touch the rug Okay great The last question Katie is will seeds grow with water sun and soil Yes Good Then make some rain drops Make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil 
 Tyler pushed the ball Okay well how does that how does that affect the ball It makes it go faster And make it fall So why is that a problem Because she ran because she because she pushed it I know but why is it a problem that she pushed it Because it goes faster And that s a problem because Because why She didn t win Oh what do you mean win She win the game Oh did you all make a game out of it Uh uh we didn t turn a game into it Okay well what are you doing then He s playing a game what are you doing Kylie He s rolling and see not playing a game Just rolling and seeing where they go Wait a minute what Rolling them to see what How many sticks it takes So did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one Taking turns Oh okay So do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them Not push them So is that what you re saying it wouldn t be fair if she pushes hers but no one else pushes theirs Because pushing makes it go faster you said Okay Alright so it makes it what Makes it go farther okay Alright so do you wanna do you want was anybody else pushing theirs Rebekah Okay do you want Rebekah and Kylie to do theirs over again Alright show them how you and Todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same Now I guess I m gonna have to get our ball I need ball number two We need a Captain Miss Henderson can I be the Captain We don t need a Captain You re all doing what you re being what We re not being Captain s we re being what Scientists Scientists So work together Wait don t pick up her ball She hasn t measured it yet Five six seven eight nine 10 11 21 sticks Where is 21 You looking for it on the hundreds chart Are you looking for it on the calendar You can get up and point to it I got 18 sticks for my ball I can t find it anywhere 18 sticks I m going to see how many sticks I got for my ball Okay how would you find 21 on the chart I don t know Where could you start By one Okay 20 Oh you found it Do you need more sticks honey 17 yes Okay go ask another group can you borrow some sticks Another ball 12 So it takes half of 14 Because she said No I m using it And she and I said I have a idea and she said no What was your idea John I was just trying do it on my head like on my back of my head then down Use your head as a ramp Uh huh And where did you have the ball hun In her pocket the whole time Why Em Does the ball belong to you or to the group Group So if you re not using it should you let someone else in the group use it Okay go ahead Roll it on my back And now roll it If it does it Right here No I mean like right here Where do you want them to where do you want them to start the ball I think is what they re asking In my head somewhere like right here Because a ramp starts where On the top Up high And goes down So if you re using his head I would lay like this Oh Did that work Yeah What do we do with it after we do our balls Okay you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we re gonna clean up in just a second Put your name at the top of your paper please We used it on this one You re supposed to do all four of the balls Ball number one ball number two ball number three ball number four We would do ball number three Number one is this one How about number one But this one Which number is that one So get number three we ll have a race and we ll So what are you all doing with the ramp now We re putting it on the chair And whoever gets it whoever gets down to the bottom first We were actually gonna roll off it Well why won t it roll off that ramp Because why What stops it The block The block stops it okay So How much does it go Try the little one Whoever is in front of me move I got 10 Miss Henderson everybody is taking our balls Okay guys I would like for you to clean up your things please I saw some great science learning science work put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug Put your paper at your seat Quickly Let s see how quickly we can clean up Id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you ve learned John you have to put everything back in your basket buddy All the sticks and balls please And then you may put your basket on the art table Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Okay let s come to the rug and let s share some things that you learned today Move that way please I said put your paper at your seat for now Miss Henderson Braxton said this isn t whistling Okay well we re not gonna debate whistling right now Okay thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug Okay I would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today Tell us something you did something you figured out Bryson If you push the ball it goes farther If you don t push the ball it goes not farther Okay alright Who else learned something else through their science work John That when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes And then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn t get to the stick then it gets farther and and we tried whoever gets to the stick It goes it s the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest Okay the green okay Todd what s something you learned today through your science work If you push it it ll go farther and that s it Okay alright anything else we haven t mentioned Eli There s a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it it will go past it If you make a ball if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop So the block stopped it sometimes Yes Sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it Yeah But sometimes it stopped it Okay Grayson Well sometimes what I did was I kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then I was rolling this big ball and once it hit it it kinda like jumped up in the air and went Harleigh And moved in And for like three blocks for three sticks Okay Preston what did you learn today If you like if your hand go fast the ball goes fast If your hand goes slow the ball goes slow If your hand goes fast what do you mean by if your hand goes fast Like if you re at the bottom and and you do that And go like that it goes fast What is that called that you re doing Pushing the thing So if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow it goes slow The force Interesting The force of pushing okay Chloe I learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes When you lay what diagonal What is it called again What A diagonal line When you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster What is she talking about Eli the what She s talking about a ramp Oh the ramp when you lay the ramp diagonal Uh huh The ball goes fast When you lay it straight it doesn t go fast it just sits there Oh so if it s if it s less If it s a lower ramp it goes less If it s a higher diagonal ramp you re talking about then it goes farther Interesting Brody We tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that So you made you made ramps with your bodies So did it go 
 Until I say switch So you stay at your center when you are finished When I say switch you may go to the next center Okay All right so Here are different centers You know where you go you may go to your center and you may begin Let s go back again let s make sure we re pushing There you go 14 14 14 Where should we start them Good job Nice job Where do you think we should start our cubes when we re gonna measure Here Yeah Because we wanna line it up where it starts Good Nathan used more force to do it Right Nathan used a little bit more force than you didn t he So when you used more force what did that do It made it go farther It made it go farther good job All right guys if you are done put your thumbs up If you are still working raise your hand in the air Okay I m gonna give you about one more minute to finish up All right how did it go Okay very nice Where should we start it Now if we re measuring where do we need to start the cube Nice job All right I want you to stop what you re doing You need to pick up your clipboard and your pencil and you need to switch Leave the cubes and the pucks at the station Clipboards pencils and switch We have no puck over here Here it is Have an idea for you Okay hold on a second let s go down the list I want you to come back put that away I saw Teddy go like this and put his fingers here and go up Why did you do that Teddy Where it was but when he marks the paper there he needs to really leave it there and then push the other ones up And I need someone else to come over here and measure Now we knew it was 10 here what are we gonna count next What comes after 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 15 okay go ahead and record that How do we know when it s supposed to be a Okay so whose turn is this one Mine Where do you need to start lining it up 50 15 50 50 So if we did 10 what comes after 10 11 12 13 14 14 Right there Nice job All right stop what you re doing I want you to go ahead pick up your clipboard and your pencils and you may switch Let me do it Can I ask a question Sure what would you like to ask me All right Okay That s a good question All right who s gonna go next in this group Okay why don t you hold on one second Can you move over a little bit Get behind it and push it 11 12 13 14 15 Yeah I did What do you notice about those two numbers Oh it s two 19 s I think Amber might get the 19 You think she might get 19 No she didn t Do you wanna try pushing it again Here start behind Nice job All right guys go ahead and switch one more time Take your pencil and your clipboard You can go first Okay guys Let s get our pencil so that we know exactly where it is Right here Okay so now go ahead and count So what did you come up with 13 13 good job Let s turn the clipboard around so you can Three backwards 35 Whoa All right now whose turn is it DaMonte s turn Go ahead DaMonte Now where do we need to start counting Right here Can you give him some tips Where do you think he should start counting Right here Okay and why The line That s where the tape begins right Or you could even go like this and start it at the tape and then you use your pencil So where does the pencil stop Right here Okay so then count to there I ll hold it for you you count 10 Ben what do you think Can you help him Seven So Ben thought that he got seven Yeah it s seven Okay so we re gonna stop where the thing begins so we re gonna stop at the seven okay Here you go good job Okay I want you to stop what you re doing I want you to quickly come to the carpet with your pencil and your clipboard Come to your circle spot I m gonna count down from five I want you to be on the carpet at zero Five Four Three Two One And zero I love how you guys get to the carpet so nice and quietly Thank you Give yourself a pat on the back for doing a really good job Now I wanna know what you noticed about using the different surfaces What did you notice about the tile what did you notice about the wood what did you notice about the cloth and what did you notice about the carpet Sophia I noticed that the cloth and the carpet was harder It was harder And so what do you think happened The puck slowed down The puck slowed down what made it slow down The bumps on the towel The bumps on the towel and when we watched that video that talked about the bumps do you remember what they called that What is it that causes those bumps Nathaniel It pushes back It does it pushes it back What s that big word that we ve been talking about Friction Friction so do you think there was more friction on the towel Not when I did it Okay so Monalisa share what you noticed When I pushed mine it went all the way down It went all the way down so which one had more friction when you were testing it Which one slowed down or did not go as far Which surface was slower do you remember The carpet The carpet so the carpet for you had the most friction Okay so does anyone else wanna talk about their surface Kayley The cloth when I pushed the puck it went kind of far but not really far because of all the bumps Which surface had the least amount of friction Daniel Wood The wood Give me a thumbs up if the wood was also the one with the least amount of friction Good job 
 So these two are gonna combine and make six X squared Yes Okay and then what about this guy Just bring him down Alright what about her You can bring her down Okay That s a four X to the fourth not four X squared Ah thank you Four X to the fourth And is this term positive or negative Positive And what about this term Positive And what do we call this guy Rock on okay good good good Alright easy one you ready Three X times X squared plus four X minus two And this time we re multiplying what kind of monomial is that Linear Linear good Times a quadratic what Trinomial Trinomial awesome Go ahead and distribute that and see what you get When you think you have an answer do you wanna show it to the person next to you and see if you agree or disagree with each other Alright alrighty So Any exciting disagreements No Nothing No one differs from anyone else No Larry Thayer He just forgot to write his down Okay but now you re cool So everybody either feels like they got the same thing or they fixed what thought they had Alright that s boring Okay so what do get when you your first product done Three X cubed Alright and then 12 X squared And then Six X And then Nothing it s simplified It s done Okay So we ended up with a cubic trinomial Now here s what I wanna show you Somethin a little different because what s the raise your hand if you can tell me the verb we did here Cubic We been talkin the verb Distributed We distributed and we also what Simplified Which one s right They re both we simplified and we used distributing in order to simplify Okay so I m gonna put a verb up here And I ll even put distribute because that s specifically what we did Now here s what I m gonna do I m gonna give you a different thing I m gonna give you this I m gonna give you four A cubed plus two A squared minus 10 A And I m gonna spice this up just a little bit I m sorry about that change that 10 A to a 40 A Alright It s already simplified It s already simplified okay So I can t give you simplify for a verb I m gonna give you a different verb Now there s a better word than what I m about to put up here This isn t really a math word we re gonna replace it with a better one very shortly And here s a clue Undistributed How do you undistribute Let s shove this expression that you said s already simplified in a time machine Imagine you got like a have you guys ever seen like fast feed photography where there s a seed And it s like they speed up the footage and you see the seed germinate and you see the little stem grow and it s kind of all jerky and everything Okay can you imagine playing that backwards and you have a little sprout and it goes back in and it ends up as a little seed Right Imagine that this was on the page as a final answer and we put it in backwards to see how it might have started as a math problem Do you use the You can do that Do you use like the factor tree Say that a little louder Alec Do you use the factor trees Alec that s interesting that you asked Alec is asking about our warm up problem today which was a throw back to when you guys were in elementary school and you talked about things called factor trees And with factor trees we talk about how you can take a number and use a sledgehammer and kind of bust it up into it s what To it s factors To its factors and we keep goin until we can t do it anymore right Huh The deal with that is you have to figure out what was originally inside and outside of the parentheses You just gotta kinda ignore the A I guess Even ignoring the A like I don t know if putting it in a facts tree you really put it into parentheses Cause you don t really have a whole lot to work with there to put it back into parentheses I don t know It s kinda going against every fiber of my being and Like why would you make a math problem out of a perfectly nice number Yeah Okay that s interesting we ll come back to that cuz that s a really good point Why would you take like a 12 and turn it into a math problem what good does that do Yeah what good is that We ll come back to that that s an excellent question With big answers Yes sir what do you think I forgot what I was gonna say Ya sure Lauren what d ya think Isn t this kinda like checking it Lauren just said something interesting She said Isn t it kinda like checking it So when you check an equation for example what do you do Put it back in So when you solve an equation it s kinda like tying a knot And then when you put it in put in the solution and you check it it s kinda like untying the knot to see if comes out the same way But we don t have an equation to plug those into You re right Carolyn what were you gonna say Okay so you know how yesterday I know this is kind of off subject but I That s okay You know how yesterday like you showed us this problem on our worksheet and it was like three times the binomial or whatever When you said we were gonna do those today Can you be specific with the problem so I know what exactly It was number 50 on Oh oh you mean the problems that look like this Yeah the ones that we said we ve already done but we really haven t Like this And you guys wanted to make this what did you wanna make this X squared oh it feels so right doesn t it We ll come back to that in a second That is sort of related to this What were you gonna say Zach and then we ll take a closer look I was just gonna say couldn t there be different like when you unsimplify that couldn t there be different answers Or is there only one correct answer Can someone restate what he s sayin here Or what do you think he means by that Sam what do you think he means by that I think he means that when like you unsimplify it it can be with the two parentheses or it can be with one parentheses and the term in front of it So you re sayin maybe it s like this and there s something here Or maybe it s like this Yeah Cause this looks I ll tell you this looks an awful lot like the answer we got here And this didn t start off with a number that was distributed necessarily like this one It started off like this didn t it How do you figure out how to throw it backwards Cause that s just like You know what let s start with the easier one Which one of those is less complicated the blue one or the orange one The blue one I d agree let s start with this way and then maybe we can go up to the orange So if I wanted to again this is not a math term we re gonna use a better term in a little bit If I were to quote undistribute or use a vacuum cleaner to suck something out of all three of these terms would you agree that it has to be the same thing that we suck out of each one In other words can I pull a four out of this and an eight out of this yeah Okay Any suggestions Let s just focus on the coefficients any suggestions on what I can pull out A two A two okay Anything else Four Can I pull a four let s go door to door Can he give me a four Can he give me a four Can she So if there was a four out there I would have to think what was in there to distribute a four two to make two I m gonna avoid fractions here Yeah see he s avoiding fractions I could I could technically pull out anything But with the factor tree we did at the beginning of class typically when you talk about that s a good point When we talk about factors we stick with whole numbers Okay Or maybe even integers but we usually don t go into fractions Sam what re you thinkin To unsimplify it couldn t you put in one of those boxes that we did yesterday for the terms Like put it in the middle and then find what it is Oh yeah Why you re talkin when we were doing this And then ask ourselves what would go here that s a weird question mark What would there and what would go there That s interesting Alec what are you thinking Couldn t you take out an A with that two Like on the problem Since it all has A s If you can take out a can you put out an A like you took out the two Can he give up an A Yes Can he give up an A Yes She give up an A Yes Well let s try that let s try that that s interesting So if I were to quote and again we re not gonna use this word much after the next Would you if you were to quote undistribute a two A from four A cubed what would that look like What would have to be here It would have to be a two A squared Well okay let s keep goin and then we ll check to see if this makes sense I ll get your question in one second Caroline So then what would be next So the two from the two would leave a ghost one And then the A from the A squared would be a what Oscar I was thinkin one A One A alright I d like that And then the two A from the negative 40 A would be a what Negative 20 Negative 20 A So now we re back to what Justin said We ve taken a perfectly nice simplified polynomial and turned it into a math problem Let s see if this is even right What do you think we could do to check ourselves like Lauren suggested Do the problem What do you mean do the problem Simplified Okay so let s simplify it real quick What s two A times two A and no peeking Four A squared What s two A times two A cubed I mean squared Four A cubed good And what s two A times A That s two A squared What kind Positive two A squared And two A times negative 20 Negative 40 A Oh it worked Yeah I have a question Yes ma am What exactly is the point of this That s an excellent question Shhhhhh ready Why on earth would you do such a horrible rotten thing Well one day shhhh One day what if you had this beast Holy Cow Whoa Do you guys know where to start No I don t know But check this out Didn t you just say we could take this and turn it That s the same thing we had right So can I factor that and turn that into two A times two A squared plus A minus 20 Are you cool with that Are you okay if I just leave the bottom Two A squared plus A
