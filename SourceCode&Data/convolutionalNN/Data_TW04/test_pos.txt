the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word worm Worm W W What letter W Good job We have been talking about spring and we have been talking about the seasons of summer and winter and springtime What season are we in right now Winter Winter Very good Well this book Hedgehog is Hungry that s written by Beverley Randell is about a hedgehog And he is asleep during the wintertime And he wakes up in the springtime and he is hungry But first look at this picture Have y all ever seen anything like this before No I saw a hedgehog in a book but not real You ve seen a hedgehogs before in a book but not real Not me Hedgehogs are pokey And when they curl up their little spikes poke out They pop up That s right Why do you think they pop up Cuz that means you re scared That means they re scared Nature protects If a person runs into the pointy stuff they ll say Ouch That s right And it protects them Well as we are reading this book today we re going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat What Hedgehog is hungry for and what he is going to eat I want you to look at your partner and I want you to tell your partner what you think hedgehog might eat I am thinking he is going to eat a worm I think he is going to eat a snail Okay Alright Well I heard I heard worm and I heard snail And she said snail too Why do you both think the hedgehog is going to eat a snail Because there s one right in front of it I think it s going to eat a worm You think it s going to eat a worm I think he s going to eat a leaf You think he might eat leaves Okay Alright So we re going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat Alright why are we reading this book To find out what Hedgehog is going to eat But guess what There s going to be some words in this book that we might not know how to read One of the words we are going to work on today is new high frequency word And remember high frequency words there aren t any rules for them are they We just have to learn the way they look so that we can learn to read them Can you read tell me what this word is Here This is the word here I love how you decoded it We already learned about it We have learned about here Here is on our Word wall Word wall isn t it Excellent job Well today it is important that you not only know how to read words but it s important that you also know how to spell words So I m going to give you the letters that you need I want you to dump them out and I want you to spell here for me I m going to turn this around so you can t look at it And I want you to spell here for me I hear Lilly saying it s Here I spelled it Alright I m going to turn it back around Are you all ready Alright check it H E R E I did it Are you all right What word did you just build Here Here Alright now we can build it so I want you to write it I want you to write the word here Not look at your letters Okay Are you ready Show me how you write the word here And then I ll let you check it again You re almost there What else do you think comes next I think you push harder You want to try pushing harder You think you got it Natalia I put an exclamation mark Here You put an exclamation mark at the end I spelled it You did Alright I m going to turn it around You all ready to check it Did you get it Alright read your word Here Here Very good H A R E here Here It s not A Alright now one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high frequency words and learning all of our high frequency words Our high frequency words are on our word wall So that s one place that you can look if you get stuck Another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part So we re going to go through and that s what we re going to do right now We are going to look at the pictures Are you ready Hedgehog is hungry That s our title Now what time of year do you think it is Winter Winter It is definitely winter Because all of the leaves are off the tree Because all of the leaves are off the tree Alright let s look at the pictures Now who do you see buried down in the leaves there I see Hedgehog You see Hedgehog Is Hedgehog awake or is he asleep Asleep And you know why he s asleep Because it s winter and he hibernated And he s hibernating Very good turn to the next page Now what season is it What season is it It s spring It s spring And is Hedgehog still asleep No No Hedgehog is awake Let s turn to the next page And there he goes Here he comes He s going out for a little walk What do you think he s doing Find something to eat He s going to find something to eat Let s turn to the next page Hedgehog is hungry And what is the first thing he finds He finds a Snail I was right Uh you were right And me Okay let s turn to the next page He s still hungry He ate worms and caterpillar Okay now that is a very big word caterpillar How did you all know that that was the word caterpillar I saw it right there Alright listen closely You all just told me two strategies you can use to help yourself when you come to a tricky word You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound Or you can look at the pictures Tell me again You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound Or you can look at the pictures Okay let s turn to the next page Now what does he find What is that Okay we talked about one of the strategies is we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound Alright let s run our finger underneath it now Let s look at it Let me write it Let s do Bug Let s spell bug and see How would we spell bug Get your arms ready Is that going to be the word bug No No So we re going to have to look at that This is the word beetle Can you say that word Beetle And look underneath it What do you see underneath it That is a slug Ooooh Now just like eyes are up here Lilly Eyes are up here Okay there we go Just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound you all also know how to decode words Is everybody s eyes up here So we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend which is sl What sound is the U going to make Uh Because there s only one vowel And what sound s the G going to make Guh Let s blend it together Are you ready Sl u g Slug Now look at me You have three ways now You can look at the pictures You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound And you can decode words that have one vowel in them Alright let s close our book up All the way up When you are reading I want you to read to find out what Hedgehog eats What is your purpose for reading To find out what hedgehog eats Alright start reading Hedgehog is hungry What did we say he was Use the pictures to help you with the tricky part We said he was a asleep Asleep Good job It wasn t doing that space in there That s right because asleep is one word There s our high frequency word here I m tricked You re tricked Alright so what will you do H un gry Hungry Very good Hedgehog is hungry Good job Slug Good job It does spell the word spring Good job Alright I love the way you all did two things I love the way you can all use your fingers to help you point I saw Lilly stretching lots of words out When she came to a word that she didn t know she got her mouth ready and she stretched those out just like we did with the word slug I saw Poniyota using the pictures help her with the tricky part We are reading to find out what hedgehog ate Do you remember what hedgehog ate Snails He ate snails What was something else he ate A snail A snail What was something else he ate A bug A bug What was something else he ate He ate a beetle bug A beetle bug Alright let s read it and make it sound like talking Hedgehog is hungry Hedgehog is hungry Winter is here Hedgehog is asleep Spring is here Hedgehog wakes up Here comes hedgehog Let s all get together Here we go Hedgehog is hungry Here is a snail Hedgehog is hungry Here is a worm Here is a caterpillar Here is a beetle Here is a slug Hedgehog is hungry in the spring Very good job I am very proud of you all 
 How s everybody today Good Good Okay we are gonna work our bodies real hard today and we are gonna play a game called Wellness Uno How many people raise your hand if you ve ever played Uno Absolutely put your hands down Do you know that there are four colors in Uno Who knows what one color is Alexis what is it Blue What s another one Um red Red What s another one Nate Yellow Yellow Green Green absolutely Okay we ve got the Uno cards spread all around the circle here first graders And what we re gonna do is in just a minute you re gonna come up here and you re gonna get an Uno card I might pick this one right here this one is a Green four Green four Okay I look at it and then I put it right back If you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones Point to where the green color zone is Boom you got a green cone over there stay right there watch Ms Miller The green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station So if this is you have choices when you come over here first graders Choice number one you can get a rope and you can swing how many times Four Four Swing four times Which rope would be easier to swing on Alexis The knot one The knot one cause you can hang on to it better that s right So you can swing or can come over here and you can do those bicep curls that we ve been working on in muscular strength and endurance Stand right here to the wall and do that four times nice and what Slow Slow absolutely And here s your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station if I got what was my number again Four Four Look there s four hula hoops on the rock wall You would start here and you would go through hula hoop one then hula hoop Two three four What happens if I had a green two how many hula hoops would I go through Paige How many would I go through Two Just two Okay so it s either four whatever number that is that s the number of hula hoops you go through Then I come back over here and I pick another card Hmm did I pick this one oh I just picked that one Let s pick this one what color s that Yellow three Yellow three Point to the yellow color zone Absolutely the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone and guess what you have to do here first grade There is a cone here and it says yellow Add zero What was my number Three Three and if I add a zero to that what does that make that number Thirty Thirty That s what we re gonna have to do I have my choice I have to do thirty of something over here Here are my choices I m gonna do thirty oh gonna work my heart thirty step boxes Or if I don t wanna do that I can do the ball on the stick How many times Thirty Thirty And if I m really good and if I really wanna try I can get a jump rope right there on the wall and I can try jump roping thirty times Now I m gonna run back here and I m gonna get another card and I m gonna get this one right here This one is a Red six Uh oh Red nine Red nine it s a red nine see where that line is under there so that means it s a nine Red nine point to the red color zone Woo you guys are so smart I come over here to the red color zone and look what does the red color zone have on it Times two Times two so what was my number Nine Nine What s nine times two Say it Alexis Eleven Not eleven this is hard What s nine plus nine What is it Nathan Do you know What is it Ethan 18 It s 18 So we re gonna do 18 Ms Miller will help you with the math if you don t know so we re gonna times that one by two and here are my choices I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get a paddle and I m gonna this is a hand eye I m gonna use my hands and my eyes I m gonna put my safety strap on and I m gonna do how many of these 6 9 18 18 that s right 18 And first grade how can I challenge myself at this station If I wanted to make this station harder for myself how would I do that Courtney Um use your left hand Use your other hand Ms Miller is left handed so if I use my left hand I would use my right hand So if you want to challenge yourself you d use your other hand so you re gonna do that how many times 18 18 okay So that s you could either do that at this station or I love these these are the I call them the ice cream cones Look you throw that ball and you re gonna catch that ball Do it again that s how many Two Two And you re gonna do that all the way til you get to whatever number you have at that station That was using your hands and your eyes watching that ball right into that cup And now I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get one more and oh I just grabbed that one let s see what s oh what s this number Blue Blue six Where s the blue color zone point where s the blue color zone over there Hey the blue color zone is balancing watch Ms Miller over here You re gonna come over here and if you don t wanna touch the gym floor Ethan sit down for me you re gonna step on the stepping stones and you can either step on the sides of the ladder or if you wanna make it harder for yourself you can step on these rungs and balance all the way to the bleachers step up come across and then we re gonna go on this balance beam Hey first graders when we re balancing do we go fast or slow Slow Slow we go slow we don t wanna go fast at this station because we wanna have good balance and we don t wanna fall We wanna make sure we don t touch the gym floor So that s wait what was my number again I forgot Nine It was a nine red how many times would I go then Nine Nine times around there Or your choice is the hippity hops Now Ms Miller s a little big for this hippity hop but you kinda get the idea you just use the boing hop hop to the black line it s one and then back is how many Two So I would do that nine times Okay those are your choices so there s four stations yellow red excuse me green and blue Turn around and face Ms Miller now I wanna talk to you about something really quick it s something called personal integrity You ready back there Ethan Everybody sit on your bottoms sit on your bottoms Personal integrity and first does anybody know what personal integrity is do you think you know Maddie when you hear that what do you think that means Listening Listening okay what do you think Maria If you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card you can t put it back and get the one you want Ah Wow do I like that definition Absolutely personal integrity this is the way I think of it is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching You said it Maria you know what my favorite I really like those swing ropes over there I really like to do that Would I have personal integrity if I came over here and I did this I got a card and it s like ooh blue I don t wanna go to blue I wanna put that back Ooh there s another blue I don t want that Would I have personal integrity if I kept picking cards until I got what I wanted No Can Ms Miller watch every person get a card No No so you have to have some personal integrity Whatever card you get that s the one what happens if I just got a blue card and I come over here and I pick another blue one What am I gonna do what am I gonna do Paige You put it back down and you get another one but not the same one No no no we re not gonna get another one we re going to what it s okay You just go back to the blue station That s right you re just gonna go back to the blue station and just maybe if you did the hippity hops maybe do the balance drill next time Outstanding okay we re gonna get started this is what I want you to do Oh I forgot one more rule when you get a card do you ever run across the Indian No Do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out we don t wanna bump into anybody Nelson do you have a question Do you have a question about something You d probably rip the card You would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself Hands down let s get started I m gonna call months of the year And if I call your month of the year that your birthday is in then you re gonna get up and you re gonna go get a card Are you ready If you have a birthday in January February or March go get a card How bout April May and June July August September October November and December let s go What d you get Chris let s see man What is that talk to me Red eight Red eight do you know what eight plus eight is Eight plus eight think about that Almost 16 go do 16 of those good job buddy Hey Paige you wait on the end of the mat there until Alexis is done What s your number Alexis Four don t hold the bottom grab up at the top like Brian is doing that s perfect yeah What was your number One What was it One One did you do one Do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card Ooh Steven Steven what d you get man What is it Blue seven It s a blue seven go Hey Ethan what d you get Now remember the line means what A yellow six Okay what are you gonna do with that yellow six Wait come here look at me you re gonna put a No you re gonna add a what to the end of that A zero and that makes it what number 60 Yeah let s go Woo look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station they are going up up down down they are getting their heart rates up What number did you have Maddie Um 50 50 holy moly Keep counting It goes like this Maddie up up down down that s one Every time you hit the ground that s one okay Woo Be careful That s okay just hold it up like this Watch watch you see how it whirls like this at the bottom There you go like that it can get pretty hard Yeah Chris I saw one card that was um um it was turned over Oh did you So I flipped it over Oh really thank you so much I appreciate you taking care of the cards for me Here you go five times two what s five plus five Ten Ten that s what it is Jamie what d you get Forty Forty Did you get four yellow Go Woo look at these hippity hops over here Outstanding Man are you guys doing a good job I like how you re going really slow at this station that s good balancing Ooh Chris way to get your balance back Slow down buddy woah Nelson I know Can you put one foot in front of the other Can you bring your other foot in front Wanna try it Ms Miller s right here in case you have to grab onto me Yeah look at that what a good balancer you are I balance on the monkey bars You balance on the monkey bars Yeah Woo Good job You did it good job All right what d you get buddy Blue four Hey are you supposed to have your card with you I ll go put it back for you remember to leave the card Hey Jane did you run through the middle of the Indian Did you forget Don t do it again go on stay on the floor Way to practice How s it going over here Paige and Ethan Keep your eye right on that ball Ooh Paige that was close Right on there good job How bout you come over here What is eight times two What s eight times two Paige do you know that That s a hard one Nine Eight plus eight Eight plus eight kids Six times two what s six plus six Six and six put the two sixes together 12 12 That s what it is Just keep going there s new music coming on there s new music coming on first grade Keep it going Way to go there Nelson I like that Woo Your arms hurt You re getting a lot of good muscular strength What d you get here let s see What is that Yellow seven What are you gonna do to that seven You re gonna put a what on the end of it A what are you gonna put on it A zero What does that make it 70 Go Woo Maddie you got a blue Nine Yes No kidding Don t go running What is that card A yellow four And what are you gonna add to that four 
 Okay you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday what we realized or what I realized is that there s still confusion on going from the general to factor General to vertex or vice versa on any of those three particular forms Also another objective we re gonna do is we re gonna figure out determine why each form is important So the first thing I want you guys to do is I want you guys to look at number one on that task card Can someone read it out loud I will Yeah Drew The Angry Bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters The bird s initial velocity was 14 7 meters per second Write an equation that gives the height of the Angry Bird as a function of time Okay so what I need you guys to do is I need you guys to write that equation on the white board Okay so now I want people to put it up on the board Okay Okay so can you guys look around to each other too I know you guys are gonna want to like show everybody what people are getting Yay Cool Okay guys these are the four things or the three things that I saw Okay so right here So if you notice a lot of you guys you guys had the first one Negative four point nine x squared plus 14 7 x plus 49 Can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out You just did it What was the question So can someone tell me how like relate this general formula to the story Since you ve read already I wants someone else to speak So who Okay Jamilah can you explain how you were able to get this equation So the height is c and the original equation is a x squared plus b x plus c And so the initial height is b which is the y intercept And then b is the initial velocity And then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose So you guys is it random No It s the scale factor Is there any other terminology for that It s the starting point Hey guys do you think it s the starting point Is it the starting point Or what else It s gravity So wait what does this negative four point nine mean That s the constant Remember it s gravity So I heard Scale factor Okay scale factor but relatively to your projectile motion what is it Acceleration Acceleration So you guys It s acceleration So right now what I want you guys to do Oh actually once again right here here are different forms of an equation that I saw So right here what do you think Can someone tell me what s wrong with this particular one They don t have a squared and they don t have an x after the 4 2 Okay so Ravelle what s the problem with this one There s no y intercept or So once again I still notice now I want to go back to the original equation Okay someone tell me in words Ah Jamilah she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a x squared plus b x plus c but according to the story can someone refer to the story back to the general equation Can you rephrase the question Yes How are we able to get 14 7 here How did we get 49 here How do you know what stuff to use The 49 is the initial height in meters so that one s gonna be your y intercept And 14 7 is the initial velocity and the initial velocity is always b so Awesome So now what I want you guys to do is I want you to go to number two So I want you to put that on the white board Can I read it again Well actually no Let s have Fatima can you read number two What does the x axis represent in this story What does the y axis represent in our story Okay let s do that quickly I have a question Yes Did x never mind I ll wait until after this So let s look around So a lot of people are getting what X equals time Y equals height So Markeisha what was your question I was gonna say could x be distance as well Can x be distance people No No If it wanted to Why not Because it s meters per second not meters per So does that make sense All right So now what I want you guys to do So so far let s recap what we ve done so far Can everyone generalize what we ve just done in the first couple of questions We set up the equation and we figured out our x and y axes in the general form Okay right now what I want you guys to do is I want you guys to work on number four Okay someone read that out loud that hasn t read out loud yet I haven t So Leslie you want to read Number four From the equation that you got from question number one show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form Now what I want you guys to do I want you to turn and talk about the strategies you re planning to use to work out this problem Okay you guys I m gonna stop class real quick You guys I m gonna stop class real quick Okay so Mary can you just ask the question that you just asked me She asked me Okay so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about So Markeisha Jamilah Can we use the box to figure it out Yeah you can Why How Hang on Put that back away So you guys So the question is Okay so Autumn just asked can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to and why You guys You guys let s listen please Mary Sorry You figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers So if you divide negative four point nine x squared by negative four point nine you ll get x squared 14 7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three And then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten Okay I ll stop you right there So back to what I said Okay so the diamond rectangle method people So when you are doing this what are you finding We re finding the box You re finding the box So what are those things outside of the box here What are they called The factors The factors Okay Okay when you re using it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula What are you trying to find then All right So right now So Autumn So you have questions on that right So later on So do you mind just moving over there real quick Because Leslie said that you got it down So you guys so take two more minutes We re gonna see both methods So are you done yet No Okay you guys stop Okay right now I m gonna put this up right here We re gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do Okay so right now so how many people got negative five and two No no no So what was it Negative two Oh okay I got negative two and five My bad Okay so right now What do you think was the mistake that she did She didn t square it She didn t what She didn t square And then she re fixed it She fixed it Yeah she copied mine It s supposed to be negative 14 7 Is that what its supposed to be Yeah And is that what she s missing Yeah Okay guys so that s one mistake that happens quite a bit Also let s look at Hey you guys what form is this right here What method did they use Box and diamond method Box and diamond method right Okay so you guys what do you call these two items right here What is it missing The number at the beginning The negative four And what is that again What is the name of the four point nine again Scale factor or what Acceleration Acceleration So you guys if you notice this is something that tends to be missing also So now we will look at ah We have the same thing We all have the same thing So same thing same thing All right Okay So right now I think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend Oh actually So now what I want is so how many methods do people use Two Okay so tell me one what was one method What was the method that you used Quadratic formula Okay Caleb What was another method that people used The box and diamond The box and diamond right So right now I want people to explain their thinking So what I want you to do is okay since Tiffany since you said you did the quadratic formula you re gonna go up and talk about it Just talk about the process of what you did How are you gonna explain the process All right So the Can we do it on this hard board Yeah Okay Let s do it on this hard board Make sure you talk to us okay Okay while you re writing things down talk about how you re going through the process So I used the quadratic formula So what are you doing right now I m writing it Writing what The quadratic formula Okay So you see instead of me asking I just want you to explain all the things that you re doing Okay So you guys need some visuals This will be your a your b and your c So you plug all this into this Okay so let s do it I have a question Yes What if the b is already negative That s a good question So you guys while Tiffany is doing the quadratic formula think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier and what mistakes that she may or may not have 
 I teach in a second and third grade combination class The students are arranged in grade level specific table groupings This allows students to complete any grade level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that s clear to them I also have a guided reading area And a independent reading corner All of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place As well as collaborative group work Students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work They have a listening center where they access books on tape and CD We have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects or they do research on the internet But complete sentence okay for that first part All right and then someone who s taking turns So we re clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around Questions If they make a mistake do you want us to correct their English or You know what what I think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak and I do this a lot so you might notice that I restate what someone has said And that s part of being a good listener So being able to recall or restate Something like oh I heard you say and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate That s a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you re trying to teach and be a role model I have a different idea I think that is Okay so there s another way I think that is excellent So we re going to just try this out and see how it goes We re going to try this out again and practice those cues Are we the same number as usual Yeah okay so here we go We re going to practice When you get to your pictures this is what I want you to do Right now I have put I have this image of a whale on okay can you have a seat I need everyone sitting next to their partners right now So what I want you to do is looking at this picture I want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture What do you see So I want you to share exactly physical features and use descriptive language to talk about what you see Question Hold on a second sweetie I just called on Jonathan Just a second Question We re going to describe with our partner So you re going to need to turn to your partner Adam what did you I don t really understand what that thing in black is You know it s just a shadow It s a shadow This one It s just a shadow on the picture It just doesn t look very clear the way it came out It s the shadow on the image okay All right so turn to your partner When I ring the bell number ones share first When I ring the bell number twos share When I ring the bell I m going to take some of your descriptive language Sharing what you see Number twos Okay excellent So I m going to pick a stick I m going to go fishing in my sticks And when I call your name I want you to share either what you saw or what your partner saw okay What was the detail that was shared And I m going to write it up on this sticky note because I m modeling now what you re going to do when you get to your stations Everyone s going to get a stack of sticky notes and you re going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see Number 10 Cesar Sorry You want to ask a question For a clarifying question No I was just making a comment Just I don t like it when there s only like one sticky note for everyone Because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see And it takes up like maybe three quarters of the whole paper And then the next group has like Okay so we re going to solve that problem because each individual gets a sticky note okay And then you re going to choose where you re going to put it All right so number 10 Cesar Madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom And she said an Orca and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth She actually named the animal which was an Orca She saw white spots on the bottom And what was the part about the teeth and a few sharp teeth Oh sorry and then sharp teeth Okay so I wrote more than one idea on this sticky note But what you re going to do is after we do the conversation after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it then you re going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note And put it onto the picture So let s try one more I m going to turn it over So look at the picture and then I m going to ring the bell you re going to share and I ll pick somebody else to share what they see Okay so who s next number 21 Roberto My partner says oh what I said It can be what you said or what your partner said whatever you decide His was good I said that I see a pod of Orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water That was great So he has two points that he sees the pod which is how we refer to A group A group excellent use of the vocabulary The Orca whale so he s named the actual type of whale And he starts looking at the dorsal fins which is one of the physical features Not only of the Orca but of what The humpback doesn t The humpback that s right it doesn t have a dorsal fin So which ones have the dorsal fin All the others ones except for that one There s a couple of other ones as well Blue whales don t Blue whales good good good good good Eyes up here Are there any questions on what I want you to do when you go around to the different stations Yes Sarah So how many sticky notes are we going to get Like a couple four or five So first I m going to give you a chance to walk around And then I m going to come around and I m going to give you some sticky notes So you re going to let us look at them and then we re going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on Yes exactly exactly What s this This one s cool I see some baleen which means it s a baleen whale And it looks like it has a big mouth And the baleen looks like it is some sort of bendy thing And on the bottom of the baleen it s scary And it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale I see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies And a person s touching it I m not sure if it s a real whale that s alive It might just be an exhibit No Jake And so I don t really think this is something that s underwater It s part of baleen It s like a baleen whale there s baleen but It looks like a Blue Whale because it is very big It also doesn t have any throat looms and it has just a small bump for it s dorsal It also looks like it s swimming very close to the top And that also looks like it s coming up for air I see a whale that a man is touching their teeth I m not exactly sure what type of whale this is but it s a whale I see someone touching part of a whale and it might be part of a baleen I see a whale and I think it s coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water I think that that is a baleen whale because it is it is white and it s a little bit gray I see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water and I believe that it s a beluga whale I see the whale I think it s going to jump out the water and then dive I see a big gigantic beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles And it doesn t have a dorsal fin 
 Look I can be a serk Now my whole house is great I can do anything good I like my school I like anything I like my dad I like my cousins I like my aunts I like my Allisons I like my mom I like my sister I like my dad I like my hair I like my hair cuts I like my pajamas I like my stuff I like my room I like my whole house My whole house is great I can do anything good Yeah yeah yeah I can do anything good Better then anyone Okay Ok what cha learn from the video She can do anything Ok what else She likes to sing Be positive She likes to sing be positive What else What else did you learn about the video Believe in yourself Believe in yourself Okay now how is this going to be related to our yearbook class Stay positive about it People get a what s gonna what the outcome s gonna be Okay and the outcome is something that we wanna be able to serve the entire school Okay what else How is this also related to yearbook and what we re trying to accomplish We shouldn t blame ourselves I m sorry We shouldn t blame ourselves Okay good good Okay so what we re going to do after this this is a good start I think for the work that we re gonna be having to do this afternoon We re gonna have to work on our ladder And I know that we ve spent some time on it we ve had to make some considerable changes But I think that the compromise the agreement that we all talked about yesterday I think it can be implemented today So what we re gonna try to do is based on These are the signatures that we have allocated One signature for elementary school One signature for middle school And five signatures for the high school I think let s try to fit it in Let s try to stay within the seven signatures Don t forget we have ads also Okay so I think Tanisha and Dustin and Jazz will be on team one And Sammy Emily and Colleen will be on team two Let s work together What are the rules of getting the teamwork going When we re trying to discuss What are the things that I want you to think about Everyone has a voice Okay everyone has a voice What else We all have to agree to a middle ground Okay And it s not just for the high school seniors Okay so it s for the entire school The elementary school middle school and high school So let s be fair and try to get everybody involved What else Discussion wise among yourselves What would I like you to be working on Collaborative work Compromise Okay let s go ahead and start You have the books there you have copies of the previous ladder Let s get it good Yeah I understand elementary school middle school high school In what order It s up to you honey If you want to start with the middle school elementary school high school I don t know maybe just cause I m a senior I kinda like that plan It just seems weird starting at the elementary school I think it s just that they re not as important just that Cause it s always started at high school It starts with the seniors and it s like this is what for Okay now remember just because it s always done before I know but If we started with the elementary school We d be starting with the fourth grade And that s really our Kind of an awkward place to start Okay now remember with your signature you were gonna start with Student Life correct With the High School So you could start with that I mean look at it and you can see And then we re gonna start it with like the introduction Um like um Pictures Student life candid shots Right And then we re going to the seniors and all the senior stuff and our classes And then the sports and night clubs Yes We re not gonna have a class class division page anymore Cause all of the classes are scrambled Are we still thinking like doing division pages Like how it was worded originally Except not for the classes Because all the classes were split up Yeah now it makes it easier to do your me right Don t forget what s our theme Me Okay so keep that it mind when you re creating your signatures And I think now that solicited more allocated the sections are allocated Your division pages maybe more adaptable They ll fit in there more Yeah They ll fit in there more Don t ya think I guess So should we just do one like just high school division page then middle school Yes try it and see See Now you might still need a division page for sports you might still need a division page But you don t need as many I think We definitely won t have one for the classes Cause they re all split up They re already split up And I think this is what helped save us pages Remember you re getting eight signatures Um Question Yeah The yearbook two pages and ads is under the high school Only because I just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end Okay So whatever is your last section you have to have ads We have to start selling ads And again if you have any questions on the photographs Sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want Show the blood drive scales And then But their only sport is the seventh grade basketball Everything else is going into high school Does it make sense Yeah yeah They all happened right there together Are we still gonna do straight lines and single lines like they did I think we might just do a big column Yeah We can still do that and then after our seniors we can explore all the classes in line And it makes sense If you have that quote Yeah We are gonna do Student Life seniors all the senior stuff And then classes Make sure that you have your page counts Are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages I guess we could do school and then We would have to have the division pages that we thought of the spread division page with all the things It could just be different little division pages Yeah okay so Or like have the title at the top of the page Don t forget she has control of the photographs So you need to consult with her okay You can ask her Okay um So are we going to do a senior opening page I think we could just have an opening page on the division page I thought we were going to do the top Instead of doing a collage how they put in their like the song and all that on the second page Around all the photos we should put Cause in our theme or whatever it s just a strip Of pictures Blended in the big picture So we re have written around it to add in these So I think that we should put these on the first opening page Now remember we did this only because we had no choice I like well I like the happenings that we decided not to do for the opening page for the seniors Because it s new life Since our theme it s just one strip We could arrange it like this I think that we should put on that page we should put these Oh definitely Yeah good idea Well what happened is the reason why I placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally it was so empty and it didn t mean anything so we went ahead and did that I think it would have been better to do that from the beginning And then we can have Alex start doing the onward for two others Do we want to put favorites before the formal I think we should put favorites So we re talking this one right These are the formals you want before the favorites No we want our favorites before our formals Oh Okay And then we re combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right Yeah Well you know what do you think Well I like combining it Can you pull up the other ladder Do you still have that one If we have that picture and then another picture and then another This one Is this the ladder you want to see Which section do you want to pull Student life I think it s on that Right here Yeah Let me know Because then I can go back and let her know So you want to start off with that So it ll be like The formal then the baby and then the quote Can you tell Emily what she missed yesterday About the quotes No were you present When you said that a lot of seniors who didn t have quotes last year They would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off If they can come up with their own And I have a quote book Somewhere and we can start deciding We can go from very funny to very serious So the kids can have a good choice Did you want me to go back to the other one How are you deciding the order Is it just from serious to funny or Well it s more funner stuff the memories into the more serious stuff And you re ending it with the grauduation Yeah You rather repeat our homecoming But that s spirit week There s another one That s what homecoming fills This is the problem On the other ladder that we had the only high school Student Life we had was Holten Hemming and Spirit Week That s the same thing Yeah Hemming and Spirit Week Like one spread and then the awards honors Well that doesn t make up for all the signatures Oh then we had prom You had the prom and then you had how about the senior the um Sports Banquet Sports Banquet should award everybody Not just seniors Yeah it s got uh Do you want to put that under student I don t What if we You cut the prom down to one page but maybe we could put it back to two pages we could show like the planning of prom and setting it up Okay but Cause I m on the prom committee Okay so and you have your committee meeting start taking pictures Guys remember we have seven cameras So take cameras with you when you re having little meetings Just make sure you re flexible enough just in case we don t have enough pictures you can flip back to one page instead of the signature I mean instead of a spread Well I don t know how we re gonna fill up the signature then Well you don t have to have we can move everything up And then we move seniors up into another half of the signature and that half would have to be colored Because it s the senior signature Um Do you have a section for committee We had those in with the clubs With like all of their what they do in the community Okay if you want you can bring it up a little more Just the overall community that doesn t have a club And use up that space Like the blood drive The blood drive is not part of the school Rotary does that Rotary yes but that s the interact is with Rotary yes Yeah we help with that We help Rotary But you also do the Victorian Classic Yes You don t have enough space You need to put the blood drive up I mean how much space breaks A spread Oh Interact has a spread Yeah we ve covered this three times now Okay sorry Yes but we ve changed it three times So Find other community things Well if you want do you want to talk about the tax bill Well that s not really student life It s going to affect your life Yeah but 
 What I need you to do is you re going to be looking at both sets of data the one from October in the morning and the one from last week in the afternoon So I want you to work with your shoulder partners okay And the first thing I want you to look at this table you can do all three Isabella you can come sit right here You re gonna work with your shoulder partners and I m just gonna take a second and I want you to see what is common what is in common how is the data aligned Okay So I want you to work with your shoulder partners want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data Okay where are you all standing What is the same between those two days You re looking from this day to this day overall what is the The heat that was trapped inside the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on and the black soaks in the heat so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers it traps it into Okay y all figured out about the black look at your other You have three other kind of solar water heaters look there see what other types you can find What did y all find out The black cover covers it Okay The black cover it s highest on both sheets On both sheets And what did you say White is the lowest and white uncovered is Whites are lower than blacks and white uncovered is the lowest Okay okay Okay everyone find some similarities Okay if you can hear me clap once If you can hear me clap twice Okay just one thing Don t tell me all the things that you have found the same Table four what did you find that was the same in those sets of data Elijah Only one went down Okay which one went down White uncovered Okay so you saw that white uncovered went down What s another scientific word for going down everybody Decrease Okay so white under decrease in both okay What else did you find Alex That the rankings were the same for each one Okay and when you re talking about the rankings what are you meaning Like white uncover had decreased the most Uh huh Um white covered was was really toward the middle Uh huh Black uncovered was also was the next one and black covered was the last one In order from the heat Okay does everyone agree Yes You all see the same thing Now what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered What does that mean Justin That black absorbed more heat Okay that black maybe absorbed the most And what did the white do Everybody It reflected It reflected or Anthony what were you gonna say Absorbed the least Absorbed the least because it was reflecting Now okay that was the easy part Now I want you to look at your graphs and I want you to try to figure out things that are different okay Things that are different this is a little tricky okay So you work with your partner try to figure out the things that are different okay Okay and how does that relate to the results Look at these results and how are these results different Okay and so you have a wider range than you do the width okay So what were you saying now That I think that the they are so seperated out the first time we did it than last week Okay girls what do y all think I think here it s like up Now think about why it would be a lot closer Ooh Okay okay well let s take he said hotter the morning what was our temperature 24 24 And the afternoon what is So think about what y all talking about Okay y all ready to report out Okay if you can hear me clap once If you can hear me clap twice Okay different Give me one thing that was different Stephanie They all got different angles Okay the lines are different angles you re right What else Chloe At 10 30 A M all of them had all of temperatures were higher as well as to the 2 30 P M Higher temps in morning okay Um what else Kristin can you think of something else What do you think Nick There s different air temperature Okay there s a different air temperature Okay what else Just looking at the overall graph Justin Just looking at just the picture of the graph how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon All of the temperatures went got decreased In the In the um at 2 30 Okay and when you say decrease which graph looked like this The morning or the afternoon The morning The morning which one looked like this The afternoon Okay so overall the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon Now why do you think that could be Why do you think that could be Kristen Because it s like on the side Oh okay here s our school okay This is where we did our experiment And Kristen s saying that the morning time the sun s here okay Where was the sun in the afternoon Anthony It was like barely Okay okay Semijah It was in the clouds Okay it was sometimes it was going behind the clouds Where was it Alex where was it in the sky You don t remember Behind the school Okay behind the school So this was our morning experiment and this was our afternoon experiment Okay and did we get different kinds of data Because what was truly pretty much the same Between both days besides the sun what was the air temperature in the morning 25 25 Okay so our air temperature stayed the same but the thing that was different was what Where the sun was Where the sun was okay So thinking about that we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school okay a solar water heater installed at the school so what other do y all know a solar water heater a hot water heater in your house okay When you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water how do you think that water s heated Does anyone know Peyton You have the water in your well you have a water heater in your garage or um Okay it s in your garage but what s heating that water The sun No 
 boys and girls for the last week we have been looking at videos about Dr Martin Luther King We ve been reading books about Dr Martin Luther King to get a feel for who he was why people loved him so much why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did So today we are going to watch another clip of Dr Martin Luther King This is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave It was his I Have a Dream speech I don t want you to so much listen to his words today as I want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he s speaking that makes him such a great speaker How does he capture his audience How does he get people to want to listen to him Alright So I want you to pay close attention It s just a short clip Then you ll turn to your partners So let s see Let me go ahead and get this started I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers I have a dream today I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together This is our hope This is our hope and this is the faith that I go back to the South with With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope With this faith we will be able to Okay I m going to stop it there And I want you to tell me first of all what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience I want you to think about it for a minute I see lots of hands up What I want you to do is turn to your share partner first Talk to your partner about what you saw Okay Let me have your attention back up here I m going to write Dr King in the middle of this web What I want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what Dr King had to say Sara He had hand motions He had hand motions But there was no hand motions in that clip Yeah there was I m glad that you all saw that I almost said something You could kind of see this hand go up but it was so close The video was so close That s why I picked that particular segment because I saw his arm and I thought Oh I hope they get that because I couldn t find a better clip Zachary The way he said a few words at a time Okay He said words at a time and stopped Very good He spaced his words for lack of something a better term to use Zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on Annie Okay Emma He spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him Okay So his tone of voice right We ll put tone of voice So it was easy to hear him Yeah And then he didn t mumble He spoke up really loud He spoke loudly He did not mumble she said He spoke loudly He spoke very serious Yes He spoke very serious Jesenya He shook his head He shook his head didn t he He nodded Very good That was my idea He shook his head Or nodded Dalen He was looking at the audience Very good He was looking at the audience We call that eye contact He had notes in front of him but he didn t do this did he No He looked up constantly He might have looked down to see where he was in his speech but he always looked back at his audience Lenare He said nice words that the people knew Okay The words that he spoke he had a good message didn t he If you have a good message people are willing to listen to you too He was a good good man One more Kalen He even had a gooder life a better life Very good And that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke the good message about having a better life All right So you guys came up with some really good points right here What I want you to think about when you do your readers theater I want you to think about how you can incorporate what Dr Martin Luther King incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you re believable in your part that people can understand what you re saying So what we re going to do is we re going to create a rubric together that s going to help you So it s called Rubric For Speaking Out for Justice Dr Martin Luther King Jr a readers theater play grade two because you guys are second graders Now let s take a look at what I ve written listening speaking viewing There s a three a two and a one Let s do listening first okay Now if three is the highest how do you think you can get a three Sayid By getting a one plus two Okay But don t think about math right this moment Oh I want you to think about if I were grading you you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three Emma We start with listening You wouldn t be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around You d be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is You have to be ready Very good You have to know where your part is Part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it s your turn to speak okay So I was a good listener Let s look at number two How do you think you would get a two How would you score a two for listening If the best is that you were a good listener what would two be Annie Looking at your paper and then like doing something else Looking at your paper but doing something else Maybe looking away maybe fidgeting So maybe you tried to listen most of the time but you had difficulty with it So we could say I tried to listen most of the time Most of the time So what about a one Kennedy I didn t listen at all Very good Like purposefully not paying attention I forgot to listen Yeah you don t decide to do that on purpose Whitney Now the next thing you re going to be scored on is speaking So how could you get a three for speaking Sara Don t speak like just normal like how the actor would speak Speak how the actor would speak Good Lenore Let s do a body check please I need you all on the carpet You re supposed to like listen to what he said Okay Annie Like speak a little louder When you speak loudly then I spoke loudly enough for people to hear I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama will Will be Will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers My dad and I have that dream too When we let freedom ring we will let it rumble We will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city We will be able to see that day when all of God s children black men and white men Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spirit Free at last Free at last Thank God almighty We are free at last Dad when I listen to Reverend King I know that he s right I know that things are going to change I think you re right Act IV It is now spring of 1963 The speech of Reverend King has continued to lead people and speak out their He has met with another president Lyndon B Johnson and has seen changes sweep across the country May Billy please come in here I have some news What is it Mom Reverend King is dead He was shot in Memphis Tennessee No Mom That s not fair He was helping all of us I agree Billy It isn t fair But remember Reverend King lives on in us Every time we remember the words every time we speak out against things that are unfair we are giving remembrance Okay So go find the people that had your card and have your conversations get your feedback about how you did Miss Walters I got all three too Great Great Did you see me I had nine points You were a good listener Very good Great feedback 
 Starter stopper opposite side Okay Everybody has their marbles How many trials are we doing Five Five trials If the first one doesn t work raise your hand I will come help you and we ll talk about why it doesn t work and what we re gonna do to change it What you re gonna do to change it Okay Timers Get your people ready Remember you re gonna say Ready set as soon as that go All right Go Ready Set Go Oh You re supposed to get it Right here This great piling direction Did y all s work Yeah Good Good Did you record the time Look Tell him You guys are ready to keep going Five trials Good job And we ll discuss why yours worked in a minute We gonna take Okay hang on Tell me what happened When it got here it stopped It stopped Why did Friction Okay the Probably because the speed wasn t great enough Okay So you think you needed more speed No I think we need to take this off Okay Let s try taking that off Where do you think you can put those to get more speed Up here Ok Now what is that gonna give the marbles More momentum Yes Let s make it bigger Three centimeters Is this our second one Are we gonna do a second try You re going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works So reset it Okay Try again Did it work Yeah Let s discuss why did it work this time Look how we gave them these By doing what By um Making it higher Elevation Ooh And what s another word that Altitude Yeah That s good Okay So it worked How long did it take Seven seconds Face the recorder Got it Okay Very good Keep going You re ready for your second trial Okay We re done Y all already done five trials Okay Well let s just stop for a minute What comes down Let s pull together here Let s talk I want you guys to talk about why you think it worked Because the big hill helped The hill What force is that The hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum Good job So gravity pulled it down What did you say I said the hill s bigger than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go To make it through the loop Right And the force pulling it down was what Gravity Gravity Good Now talk to me about the order that you put it in Why would you you kind of just did We put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop To get more speed behind it Good And the turn would Make it slow down Yeah So what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end Friction Friction Okay Very good We got all five trials You guys need a knee Start recording your information It went really fast Really fast Just three seconds Did it work on the first trial No Okay Tell me what happened on the first trial It was like that And it just went off right here Okay Why do you think it fell off What was going on right here to make it fall Twist There was a twist in it So you just had to fix it so that it went straighter And so you pushed it Renny put it like this like around here Pushed it in So it might have been a little to steep too That incline might have been too steep What order did you put your elements in Hill loop and turn Okay And why d you put the hill first Because it s higher And it would give more speed What force is giving it more speed right here Gravity Very good Okay And then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn Why didn t you put your turn there If we turn there s not enough speed For the loop Okay Y all both said the exact same thing Repeat that to me so I understand If we put the turn first it won t have enough speed for the loop Good Very good All right Good job guys Have you got five trials It s all three seconds All of em were the same That s interesting Very good We ll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information Anthony what was your job Record So you were the one that found that they were the same each time Make sure you get written down everything Okay guys Talk to me We got three Did the first one work No Tell me what happened on the first one becuase I didn t see it The first one we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down right here when the chair was right there it kept on falling off So it just dropped So you think the incline was too what Straight It was too steep There you go That s the word I m looking for It was too steep Because it was right here and it was going all down Very Good So what did you do to fix it We kept on sliding it down a little Did you have to slide it down more than once Yes Good job guys So did you get it to where you could do five trials Yes And we got three for each Three seconds They did too They got the exact same for all of em How about that But look at your coasters They look different Yeah That s interesting too Cause their incline is steeper than yours Lets talk about the order that you have your elements in What s first The hill because it gives more speed when it s going down a hill so you don t But that s on what force Gravity Good job And why d you put your loop right after that Because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it Because if we did the turn it wouldn t have enough speed to make the loop Good job Good job Need a knee record your information and start figuring your speed Have you guys got all five trials Nope Uh oh What happened It stopped because of the friction When it get right here it started getting out of friction Friction right here What s causing friction right here Can I watch it Its gonna work this time because we taped it down Why do you think it s gonna work Because we taped it down You know what I want you to use that one How long did that take Seven Seven seconds All right Do it again Let s look at it again So it was stopping right here It always was stopping right there and then I taped it down Oh you taped this down That thing could be higher Okay I think you should try that We can use this clock No we need some more I was gonna get one of them books Guys you can use any state So what are you doing to the hills Making it bigger So the speed will go more faster More faster So that it ll increase the speed All right Let s see what happens Let s see if this one works Angel what are you doing Timing Ready One Oh We use good team work You are using good teamwork I m proud of it Ready Set Go It didn t start from the beginning I did not start that one Let me ask you this Just to give you a different idea because you ve already tried to change in the elevation of your hill Maybe how big the loop is How do you think that ll help So the will go faster and will make it go through All right We re gonna try this Help her out guys So we re making the loop smaller and that s gonna So now you might want to move this up a little bit there You see how this is gonna have to go There you go What about your taping If it s will the Yeah Let s try again Wait We were gonna time that honey Now you re ready to go So what was the solution to your problem To make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster All right Good job Now you re ready to time five trials Ready Go Look how beautiful Good job guys How many seconds Four Four seconds That s good How many trials Three We got two more I want to know You got three seconds on each one So your speed was the same Where did your distance come from We did how many feet and then we found out how many inches And times it by 18 because it s 18 on there How long was each tube Six feet Six feet How many inches is that Let s work it out Make sure you ve got it right on here 72 So you ve got 72 inches We only did one tube And how many tubes are there There s three tubes So 72 What would you do next Times three Yes 72 times three How did you guys get 216 You did 18 inches instead of six I mean 12 Okay So now you ll have to go back and redo your speed Figure in your speed So how do you find speed I still got 216 Well then you were right That s right So you guys are ready to go on to make a graph Let s talk about the graph you re gonna make Let s talk about the graph Thinking about what you ve learned in math and what you ve been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here What is this right here Time I want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs I want you to decide what kind of graph you should make Line graph because it s over time Yeah Line graph I decided Yeah we decided to put a line graph because it s time So any time you use time the line graph is the one to use Very very good Do we write the numbers on here Yeah How are you gonna know what numbers to put on there Think about it You ve got the trials the distance the time and the speed Do you need to use these You re probably just gonna use your trial and your speed So you ll label your line graph One will be the trial and one will be the speed And do you remember when you did the race car activity Not the race car activity I m sorry Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail What did that line graph look like It was a straight line Because it was a constant speed So what do you think this is gonna look like Constant speed A straight line Good Okay You ve got your trial You got your times Let s talk about your speed First we need to look at your distance How did you figure distance We need to divide by those speeds But your distance is how far the marble traveled right 18 Yeah 18 Yeah because you said each was six feet Six feet You re doing it in inches Oh So let s go back and refigure that I want you guys to talk about how to do that Cause we want it in inches So what is the first thing you would do Y all talk through it Y all talk to each other Let s talk about it After you re done erasing I was thinking like how many inches each Okay There you go Talk about it Anybody know how many inches are in a foot 16 Nope Try again If you have a ruler 12 Yep Good So that s 12 x 3 Good 36 Okay So 36 inches and then how many of these are there Three Uh huh 36 multiplied six speed So you need to do 6 x 12 6 x 12 is 72 Make sure you got it right I did it before It is 72 So now you will do 72 times Three Good Do it on your paper It s 216 inches Okay Now what are you gonna do Write it down And then what Multiply 216 to this So how will you figure speed now Divide Divide what Three to 216 Very good Can you tell me that again Jeffrey You re gonna do what Divide 216 into three And you ll only have to do it how many times One Because you got the same speed each time You can do three into 216 72 And no remainder That s nice Isn t it Now knowing what we know about graphs what we re doing in math Jeffrey are you listening Y all stop writing for a minute and listen Knowing what we know about graphs what we talked about in math and using this data and speed what kind of graph do you think you re gonna make Line Why did you say a line graph Because it s the same I want you to think about this right here Over time We discussed we need to use a line graph okay When you make your line graph which two columns there s only two columns that you can use on there Which two do you think you re gonna use This one and Well you ve already figured that out This one and which other one And speed good Right Because you were figuring all this for speed What do you think your line s gonna look like Straight Straight Because it was the same every time Good

partner and standing with equipment on the ground I ve got two groups ready equipment s on the ground You re looking for somebody you may have not worked with already You should have found a partner If not you guys will start Thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground Lost and found Lost and found always come to the start very good When I say go you re going to turn to your partner I want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity What I have on the board over here and I also have it on my screen Lifetime activity what does it mean to have a lifetime activity What does the word lifetime mean Go Bryan soccer baseball Maybe not Soccer Maybe one of those yeah maybe it could be yeah soccer Volleyball Yeah volleyball And five four three two and one My partner and I Zachary had some really good examples of what lifetime means so I m gonna use his Zachary said that lifetime means you do it now as a third grader but we could do it later in life as an adult Raise your hand if that s what you and your partner kinda said It s something you should be able to do later in life Very good And then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life Zachary said two cool ones tennis Anybody else say tennis Awesome pat yourself on the back And he also said bowling and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader and later in life is that they re pretty good on your body You can still do em they re not gonna injure your body too much It s gonna make you strong and healthy We have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out We ve talked about aerobic capacity And tennis will make your heart beat faster You have to find something that s gonna make the heart beat faster So now turn to your partner talk about what you re gonna choose to make your heart beat faster Go And five four three two one Pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity that you re gonna choose nice job When I say go you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face off position So this is where my partner and I came and we put our equipment down Then we ll turn and look at the board Ready Go Looking for an open spot with a partner Thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly Now we re transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges So far we ve worked by ourselves to be responsible learners Brian are you looking for your partner He s right here So now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners On the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday Zachary and Ms Rock will show you an example of what you could practice We re gonna actually skip this level today but you could choose it if you said Hey you know what let s go back to this other level So Zachary and Ms Rock both have our rackets we re gonna practice underhand striking keep up Raise your hand if you remember that Awesome Alright here it is I tick step tock and he s gonna strike back or he can catch it and then I m gonna keep striking We re gonna keep our paddles low go ahead Alright I m gonna wait til it gets low so I can strike he s gonna also wait til it gets low to strike Keeping that paddle low We re trying to keep it up as long as we can Awesome So that was the first level Striking keep up with the balloon Now we re gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner Super duper cool It looks like this Only one person will need a bean bag Since I m closest to the wall I m the person to have the bean bag first I m going to be the underhand thrower Zachary go ahead and pick up your racket Create a flat surface I m going to underhand throw he s going to catch it on his racket Take a step tock Good try You might have to reach out and get under it Now he s gonna leave it on his racket and he s gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands Go ahead Take a step tock I catch alright He needs to have three tries with the racket then it s my turn to have three tries with the racket Thumbs up if you understand Down if you got a question Alright Person closest to the wall you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag Bring it back and place it in your racket Go Quickly quickly and five four three two one You should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket Raise your hand if you have a question So partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up You re the tosser first with your hands You only need the beanbag You only have the beanbag Grab your place on your side Thank you Christopher for being safe We re gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly We re gonna see how far we get We re gonna be responsible if the beanbag is not working so well you can go back to a Balloon Balloon Alright let s practice Go One catching on their racket one catching on their hand I hear good communication with a partner You have to help each other One person is underhand throwing one person is catching Awesome if you haven t switched jobs go ahead and switch jobs at this time If you haven t switched jobs See how many good catches you can get Give yourself a point for each catch Hands or racket Are you using the opposite foot to step back with Both partners pick up rackets Both partners pick up rackets Look at the board now you re gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge Count how many you can get Go There you go Zach Excellent One And freeze Alright from here I m going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners We have learned to use a bean bag with a partner We re gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball and a large tennis trainer Both of these offer different challenges The first one is a foam ball As you can see on the screen they now have a foam ball Zachary picks up his racket We are doing an underhand strike back and forth But like we did with the tennis ball we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to So Zachary do you think if I tossed this to you you could try catching it Alright let s see Nice He had to figure out how to keep that balance on here He s gonna do the same thing back to me This is just working on looking for that ball getting our feet to it and keeping a flat surface We can do the catching with the ball now we re ready for the tap offs Remember what we did with the balloon We re gonna try to keep the foam ball up This is what it looks like Tap tap good try It went away a little bit stop it we come back I tick step tock Good We re keeping a flat surface coming back slanted out The lower the racket the better control we will have I want the racket to stay at a slant to partner Can you say that Slant to partner So that s the foam ball challenge Some of you may just stay with the foam ball But if you re like I wanna challenge myself and my partner I say Zachary we can now use the tennis trainer And it s going to bounce strike bounce strike The bouncing is gonna bounce here before I hit it then it will bounce in the middle then my partner will strike Okay Ready Zachary So it s a bounce strike bounce strike Excellent And I would come back and start it over again if I need to Bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike Catch when needed Were we controlled Yeah When it got out of control we caught it So from here on out you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with bean bag What came next Foam Ball And then Tennis trainer Excellent See how far you get with the partner you re working with This uses communication and cooperation Say that Communication and cooperation Excellent This is how it would look Zachary what piece of equipment would you like for us to use Or you think you re ready The The foam ball Or the balloon What did you say The end one The end He said he wanted to use the tennis trainer W for Wilson it s the brand I said Oh you know what Zachary I don t feel like I m ready for this one Can we go back to a foam ball first And he said yes I m all phew thank you We just had communication and cooperation I know that I can practice with this one for a little longer I ll probably be ready for the challenge Alright ready go Are you able to keep your paddles low Keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled Are you using an underhand strike Alright ready Zachary Bounce strike bounce strike let it bounce one time Bounce strike bounce strike good Bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike Now I m going to give you a challenge so I can go around the room and see if anyone needs help You ll just work on tap ups you can use any equipment that you need okay Tap ups or tap downs If you and your partner need a little help you can always raise your hand and I can come over Try to review those cues with you Underhand strike Okay bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike Okay say that bounce strike Okay and if it s not working then you and your partner need to say We need to go back to the Be responsible try it again though Bounce strike bounce strike Ooh this is where Aiyah did she step with her opposite foot Did you step when you strike No so it s key to step when you strike You gotta step Try it again Keeping those paddles low If you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot that s a reflection you should say Ooh we A need help or B let s go to a different level Responsible word I hear Which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with And freeze Equipment should be back on our rackets Now I see students at all different levels So that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class which is excellent But now we re gonna see if you can switch it up a bit and give yourself a challenge You should be able to work with anybody So what I m gonna have you do is let s see here Ellie Ellie is gonna step over here come jogging down all the way down to where Zachary is Yay Ellie Ellie is gonna slide down one and that s gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner Where you going Very good Zachary And then you go one down yep there you go Now wave to your new partner Excellent Same thing here Harrison come on down And slide on down Wave to your new partner Now you all of a sudden have to have more communication because you don t know where this partner is at Ready Go Talk which one are you gonna do 
 Just take it in but take your tube off first Before you pull it out before you pull the needle out take your vacutainer tube off and this is Pull it out again Yeah Use your two by two remember Oh yeah There you go Good job Faye And guys it just takes a while This is not something you re going to learn overnight This is a skill that it takes a little while to learn You ve got to get hand movements down you ve got to figure out what works best for you You know if you need things placed in a different position But after this you all can start sticking the arms when you re not doing your book work Then whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down you feel like you re proficient then I ll watch you which I ll watch you doing then you all will stick me So what do you think Cassie Hmm What do you think Is it easier than you thought or harder than you thought Easier Yay Faye Those arms are a little harder to get Those veins are not as easy to feel as That s okay She s doing a fine job Two by two Sorry You to draw blood from them Pop your tourniquet Engage your safety Good job From down there Yeah They say not to use these and you can use hand veins but remember first choice second choice last choice and then hand veins If you re going to do hand veins you all have been through a lot of the book work already if you re going to use hand veins what kind of needle are you going to use Butterfly Butterfly Okay I know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic You guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab We ll do it at Dr Maderis clinic so that you all can get more sticks there Is there some people who draw only from around here Not usually Now there are some people they ll come in and they ll say You can t get blood from anywhere from me except here What that one lady told you is right here right I m better at popping it out Remember I couldn t get it in Good It will be something that after you get these hand movements down it ll just happen Because when I m not talking while I m doing it I mean it just flows Because I have done it for several years but for some reason after you get older it s hard to talk and do something at the same time That s what we re going to do today is you all are going to learn how to draw blood You re going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they re called And each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you re ready to start drawing blood And I know that Wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because guys when you get out there in the clinical area a lot of people don t follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws Guys that are medical assisting you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor s office When you re there in the doctor s office it s just you and the person So you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don t get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn The first things I want to talk about is your vein choice And I printed off your veins And the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle You can see this one better Yeah you see that one better Your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from That s the one that runs little finger side And then your cephalic is on the thumb side So this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from And the reason that this is your last choice vein is there s quite a few nerves that are right underneath it So if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage And I will leave this on the table as y all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice Nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you re choosing your vein You can only advance or withdraw the needle only You cannot go sideways I know those of you who s already been in the clinical site you ve seen them go sideways you ve seen them come out and go back in And guys that could be a liability for you and you re the only one that can protect your patient and you I ve got the materials set up Whenever we repeat this you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we ve got here because you ll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms When you go to clean your arm you re going to clean in a circular motion So I m going to go ahead and get started First thing you re going to do I don t need your gloves just the two hands First thing you re going to do is put on your gloves I just washed my hands but I m going to put on my gloves And why do I want to do that Jim So I don t get infected Yeah I don t want to come into contact with someone s blood Now who could protect me from coming into contact with someone s blood Yourself I m the only one that can do that And I can tell you from having my blood drawn people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn t know me from Adam And one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them So I am the only one that can protect me If I see you practicing without your gloves on it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day If I see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on then we re going to have a big talk okay Because you ve got to protect you I have a question With some people that you draw blood on do you have to wear a mask Like an eyeshield type thing If they are on precautions then yes you would And you ve seen at the hospital on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation If you were to go into one of those rooms yes you would In the ER when you draw blood you usually have on that splash mask Now usually with a venipuncture you re not going to have that much pressure It s not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would but still it s better to err on the side of safety But also if there s nothing wrong with me except I need a CBC to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield I m going to think Oh my gosh Why is she doing that You know So make sure that it s appropriate If you re in a trauma area then yes definitely If you re in an outpatient clinic unless that patient tells you My veins squirt blood really bad A patient will tell you One time I was doing a finger stick and it squirted and I had on my glasses but I turned my head It hit me in the hair So sometimes the venous flow will do that Good question Cathy All right so got my gloves on first I m going to do is I m going to put the tourniquet on And guys the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it And you re going to put it underneath the arm You need to make sure it s tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you re going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you re going to cause petechiae which is little red patches on the arm I m going to cross my hands over What I do is I put my left hand in position I take my right hand get ahold of the tail of this pull it and then I stick it underneath with my little finger You always want your tails up toward the top so they re not in your area where you re going to clean and draw When I m going to clean well let me show you how to feel first Well it s not going to cooperate today You can use my arm That way they can see better Can you move the Sharps container I m going to stick it underneath there And now it should stay on there Now to locate a vein I m going to take my index finger and I m going to feel back and forth And guys you all can do this on each other Jim s excellent to feel veins on and he s a real good volunteer Bounce back and forth It feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there If it feels really hard like I have one that I ll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard you re not going to get blood out of it It s got to be it s got to bounce So when you go across and you find it then you re going to find which way it travels So you re going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in Some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight So I found my vein Now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute Has my tourniquet been on about a minute Probably so so I need to take the tourniquet off give this patient s arm a rest and then I can talk to them about the weather I can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time and then I m ready to draw blood now So I come in here I put my tourniquet on and guys when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute And I m going to clean I m going to clean in a circular motion and then if you re having trouble with the alcohol you re not able to fan it you can t blow on it and you can take one very clean 2 by 2 go straight down dry it off and then many of you already did that This part of the needle this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it You screw that in take the end off this is a safety needle You anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle that is the pointy part the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin I pull my thumb away as I m going in I take one of these Vacutainer tubes thank you Jim and I push it in And guys when I push in with my thumb I m pulling back with my fingers And you re not able to see but there is and I don t do this in the clinical side but there is blood coming in there You let it fill until it stops Now it s stopped flowing I m going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle the less it s going to hurt the patient Pop my tourniquet and I m going to take a different 2 by 2 than what I cleaned with Fold it lay it on the arm and guys I m just going to kind of hover there until I bring the needle out and push down If I push down while the needle is in the arm it hurts really bad And I m going to hold here and I m going to hold until it quits bleeding And you can peek Now if the blood oh sticky needle engaged It s hard to talk and do stuff at the same time isn t it Sharps And you toss that in the sharps Now if this patient is on blood thinners I ve got to hold longer A lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there put a CoBand on them and send them on their way If they bleed out outside of the lab you re liable And again you re the only one that can protect you So I make sure that they ve stopped bleeding And now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full You guys have been observing Can we ask them to hold it Well you can But what if they don t hold it tight enough What if there s a whole lobby full Jim what have you seen them do in the past and check Yeah You need to check it If there s a whole lobby full sitting out there then you ll get to them when you get to them because you ve got to protect your phlebotomy certificate You re the only that can do that A lot of places they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there tell the patient to hold their arm up That breaks platelets that s going to make a huge bruise and it doesn t really help with the clotting that much just kind of bruises So we re going to look here Okay this patient has quit bleeding so I am good to go here Now another lesson I will teach you about writing on the vials the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there So before you all draw let me ask you a few questions What s your first choice vein Median Median Okay And why do we avoid the basilic Nicole Nerves and tendons Nerves Okay What can happen if I powder on the shirt What can happen if I dig around in there and I do injure somebody What can they do They can bleed or they can have their nerve damage Right And they can come and say This phlebotomist drew here And then guys if you re ever in a setting where you have to go to court they re going to call somebody that s a phlebotomist like you are and they re going to ask them What s your first choice vein And they re going to say The median and they re going to say What s your next choice What s your last choice So you re going to have somebody there that knows You really don t want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice Okay what can happen if the patient s on blood thinners Cassie what s the most important thing to remember about the patient that s on blood thinners To keep pressure To keep pressure Okay How do you clean your site Martika In a circular outward motion Circular you don t ever go back over And how long do you leave the tourniquet on Faye One minute One minute Good job Okay You all get your First thing you do is what Gloves Get your gloves on So you all are going to draw With drawing blood are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to I would if I were you because that just protects you So you can write median You can write an MC median cubital and that way you may actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw And that way they know that you drew from the median That you didn t draw from basilic I need another needle Okay Anybody else need another needle Thank you You re welcome I m going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody Feel their veins feel all the different types of veins Some people have garden hoses is what I call them Some people have very large veins And feel for your vein The tourniquet pinched my thumb The gloves are hard to you trading them out It s this arm Jim I think because I had trouble getting it When I was doing it too Okay Just make it a little tighter with your Oh Did you stick yourself Mm mm Okay I screwed the wrong part I think she s bleeding and I haven t even done anything yet Oh yeah hand me another one There it goes again Okay Casey Let me see what I can do for you Good job Martika Want to just chill how s the weather blah blah blah blah Is it not come undone now You might want to pull your tail just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails It ll stay down Okay It s moving again You re kidding See Okay Just keep going Okay Just keep going It s easier on a person That s my stomach Jim It s hungry Sorry Yeah this one Jim knows which ones stay better Okay you got to anchor your vein with your non dominant with your non dominant hand you anchor your vein I have to stand I can t see you take your thumb and you pull down here Anchor your vein There you go Casey are you left handed too Mm mm I thought you said non dominant hand Non dominant hand to anchor Back it out Put it in this hand Are you right handed Mm hmm Put non dominant hand thumb there anchor Okay Now did you clean it Yep Okay Then go in Uh oh It s okay It s okay Well that s okay Put that on Start over A lot of this is hand movement A lot of this is prac
